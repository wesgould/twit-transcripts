[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.560]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show we cover the latest news from the Google verse.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.560]   Jeff Jarvis is on assignment in Canada in the Great White North.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.560]   But that's okay. Stacey Higginbotham's here from staceyoniot.com
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560]   And hi Stacey.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.560]   Looks like it's freezing in Austin. That can't possibly be the case.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   It's okay. It's not really freezing. I just my office is really cold. It's like 50 degrees here.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.560]   That's pretty chilly if you used 105.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   So it was 90 degrees on Sunday and then it was 45 on Monday.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   I hate those swings like that.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.560]   Also with us her cohort partner in crime. Former giga-omber as well.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   Mr. Kevin C. Tofel of about Chromebooks.com. Hello Kevin.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560]   Hello right now. I'm all about this playground on the Pixel.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   We've been playing with it. Kevin has did you get a reunion or just get your Pixel today?
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   This is a reunion. Okay.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.560]   Mine the official one that I bought came today and I got black.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.560]   I didn't have the fortitude shall we say to get the pink one not pink one.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.560]   And now I wish I had because this is very black.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   Boring. Boring. I have with me the Pixel 2 so we can kind of compare on the backs.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   They're very similar looking although the Pixel 2 which is the white one had a metal back.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   This has a plastic back but they feel or a glass back I guess. I don't know.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   It's all glass. It feels very similar. Too toned kind of.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   This is more rounded and I don't I don't you probably can't see it and it feels a little bit more solid.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   Maybe a little thicker. It's hard. It's really hard to tell. I guess not.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   Does it feel like it's going to fall out of your hands?
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   I mean every time I have with you glass cases I feel like I'm going to break this sucker.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   It's not that it doesn't feel slippery particularly.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560]   I have to say the screen is awesome. It really looks painted on.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.560]   You know what I I forgot within seconds about the notch but maybe that's because I use an iPhone 10s.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   Doesn't that screen look super solid? This is one of the Google Live Wallpapers.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.560]   I called it last week. We found out they use Samsung.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.560]   Samsung.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   In other words this looks every bit as good as say a Note 9 or an S9.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   You know the display display mate people is that who reviews all the screens?
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   Yeah they came out with their report this week and they said it's an A+
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   I don't know if it's quite as good as the ones that Samsung uses for their own phones.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   But I mean if you can tell the difference you know I'll give you a dollar because that's impressive.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   Now I turned on boosted colors which makes it look very much like a Samsung.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   But you know what this does make sense it's a Samsung display because it has the same options.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.560]   The Samsung displays have natural.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   See if you can tell the difference in the picture of flowers.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   I don't think on the on the on the stream you'll be able to boost it which is just a little more vibrant.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   And then adaptive I guess it came set up with natural.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.560]   But I'm thinking adapt is probably a sensible choice right adapting to the.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.560]   Does that mean like when you lower the blinds it's going to react?
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   No I think it well that's a good question.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   My guess is and on Samsung phones it means it adapts to the content.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   Right.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.560]   So you know yeah.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   I like boosted to be honest with you.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.560]   But those icons do really look painted on I mean and the text is very super crisp.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   I said it a little bit larger text for my old eyes.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   Now you have the notch mine is notchless.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   Oh you have the little one a little bit you got.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   No no no you turned off the notch.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.560]   I did.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.560]   I did the notch.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.560]   It's I don't mind it either but I'm trying to get you know trying to figure out which I like better.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   So you have a double chin phone.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   I have a double chin phone but it's a little more symmetrical as a result.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.560]   Oops let's do that.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   And there's no consumer facing way to do this but you can do it in the developer options.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.560]   You know tap the build number and then you can get an option to turn the notch off.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   But thinking about the notch because people really hate the notch and I've been looking at this notch and I think the reason people hate the notch apple.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   There's that you'll find an article somewhere by a designer I think it's on medium about apples notch and the curves they use for the notch in the detail they put.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   Google didn't they didn't really pay as much you know if I should get my iPhone 10 so you can see.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   But Google didn't quite pay as much attention and so this looks more like a it's certainly a bigger notch but it also looks it's hard to describe it.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:10.560]   It looks more aggressively notchy than apples notch which is not only a shot more shallow here is this this is your phone though right.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.560]   Alright so it looks like a tab and chrome upside down.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   How are we going to see the notch.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   There it is there it is there as you can kind of see the notch there.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   So there's a see how much shallower and wider the apple notches than the Google notch.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:42.560]   And I think also though and this is really subtle but look at how the curves are on the apple notch apple put apparently a great deal of design into those curves and look at the curves in the Google notch and as a result the Google notch almost looks like it's coming in on itself at the top.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.560]   It looks like a face and I think that's what people more objecting to than the size of the notch to be honest in any event.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.560]   I think it's a tempest in the teapot I don't think it's going to bother anybody we're used to notches now camera has to go somewhere.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   It's got to you know if you know go ahead.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   No I was going to say if I tally up all the time in my life I've now spent talking about notches.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   I know.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.560]   I could have eaten a really nice dinner.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.560]   Maybe done a couple workouts.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.560]   I personally more perturbed about the lack of a headphone jack but you just we just have to kind of give up on that I guess.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   Oh man my husband he's got an iPhone 6 was that the last one.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.560]   Yeah my mom won't give up her iPhone 6 because she doesn't want to.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   Yeah he's like it's small and it has a headphone jack two things I want in a phone.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   So I'm like oh buddy I hope that lasts.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.560]   But it's out of support now.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.560]   Right.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.560]   This coming year or this year.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   I know you're going to you he's going to have to get a Samsung phone.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   This comes with and Dieter Bohn in the Verge said these are actually you know they're $30 type C headphones but he said they're actually surprisingly good quality.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   And at least this time the type C works with all type C devices.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:05.560]   So I'll try it because as you can see I just got this I haven't had a chance but I'll try it with the Samsung type C and other type C's.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.560]   Essential phone had a type C headphones as well that didn't work with everything.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.560]   I only worked with the essential.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   So I'm just a little as its own issues.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   Yeah this doesn't really right this doesn't solve the problem though because you can't charge.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   Well I guess you can if you've got wireless and by the way I'm waiting for it if it comes we'll open it up today.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   The the Pixel seats are Pixel 3 charger which I also ordered.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   But I put this on a Samsung Rapid charger and it was able to charge it sideways so I could have the phone.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.560]   So I could have the phone sideways listen to the headphones and still charge it if you're using wireless.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:47.560]   These headphones are interesting because they have an in-ear loop which would I presume.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   An in-ear loop.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   So this is going to go in the inside of the ear.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.560]   And stabilize it?
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.560]   Let me just try it.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.560]   Yeah it does it's nice and it is adjustable just like the buds right.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   So you can you can I think that's actually a nice touch.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   I have such sensitive ears I think I have both small ears and sensitive ears because I've got like my
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   Jabra ones I can only keep those in for like two hours and like my whole ear gets sore.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.560]   It hurts yeah no I'm with you on that.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.560]   So what are you doing?
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.560]   I can't use I take out my headphones and I read a book.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.560]   Yeah well you know the other other option is this and this these are molded to your ear you have to go to an
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.560]   audiologist and they pour stuff in your ear and you have to sit still for two minutes and then they pull it out.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   There used to be a company that took you took your camera phone and you actually stuck a quarter
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.560]   next to your ear and take it.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.560]   I think it's all around.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.560]   Yeah I don't know how well that works.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:53.560]   These are very comfortable as a result because they they're they're I wear these all day on some days right.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.560]   Well that's your job.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   It is my job and I know I like you know as as a radio host for years always wore over the ear saw
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   over the ear headphones like those AKG K240s and I still wear those in the studio and the other studio I like them.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   But these are these are better for on camera because you can't really see them.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.560]   These are the these are I think of them as the Bono headphones.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   I tell you what if you ever I'll try those out when you guys pay for them.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.560]   Yeah they're only a thousand dollars exactly from ultimate years.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.560]   So the funny thing is that that was good.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.560]   Yeah we have all that we got a new technical director Carson's got the the week off.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.560]   You know what Carson's doing by the way.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   He's building a haunted house for his kids school.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   Nice.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.560]   He is awesome.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   He's a man of many talents.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   But I was just saying these thousand dollar headphones.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.560]   There I think they're Jay audio is the make manufacturers former I see what used to be.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.560]   They use a headphone jack.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.560]   So I can't use them with anything.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.560]   Except old fashioned obsolete studio gear.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.560]   The day studio gear loses headphone jacks is the day I retire.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.560]   You have an adapter with the Pixel 3.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   Yeah it comes a dongle.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.560]   It actually comes with several adapts.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   You can't even get it out of the box.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.560]   Here I'll show you.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   Yeah because I got it.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   I got it.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.560]   You're stuck in a TV.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.560]   It comes with a C2C connector which is very handy when you're copying your data over.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:26.560]   And if your phone is not that kind of phone, a type C phone, it also comes with a type
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.560]   A to type C adapter for the same purpose.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.560]   And even though Apple no longer includes it, it's got a type C to headphone jack adapter.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:41.560]   Apple's decided according to Apple nobody uses headphones anymore that use headphone jack.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   So we're just not going to bundle those anymore.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.560]   Everybody's on Bluetooth now.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:54.560]   I think this is so far I'm liking this and I've been taking pictures.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.560]   And I do have to say I feel like the portrait mode and the picture modes are pretty good.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.560]   You might see if I can find some pictures.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   These are low light shots behind the scenes studio shots.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.560]   Actually I should pull these up on Google Photos because by now they're copying it over to Google Photos.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   But look at that.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560]   That's a portrait of my wife.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   I think that's really nice.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   And that's in portrait mode so I can do the slider.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   It actually did top shot for some reason.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.560]   They're the same.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   So I get to chew.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560]   Oh, I get it.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.560]   One's in portrait.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.560]   I get it.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   And one's normal.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   I get it.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.560]   So how do I do the slider?
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.560]   Is that this?
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.560]   That should be in the edit settings down below.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.560]   Well there's your color pop.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   Nope.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.560]   There it is.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560]   It's going to change focus.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.560]   So I can focus.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.560]   Well that's going to do the color.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.960]   Oh, oh should I do the color pop and just make, let's see, make her face be color.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.560]   Oh yeah, everything else is black and white.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.560]   That's kind of cool.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   That's like those.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   Remember in like the 90s, those little pictures of kids?
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.560]   All those silly effects are back, baby.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.560]   Okay.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.560]   I'm actually pretty excited.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   I think this is going to be a very nice fun personally.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.560]   I have to add effects to make professional looking photos, but how?
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   I don't know.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   Back up.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.560]   Oh, I have to turn all this stuff on, huh?
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.560]   Now it's copying to Google Photos.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:37.560]   So when you first get it, you, at this happened last year I seem to remember you plug the cable
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.560]   into your old Google phone if you have type C to type C or use the adapter.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.120]   So copy a lot of that stuff over.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.640]   I was able to set this up literally about 15 minutes, even downloading all the apps and
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   everything.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.960]   I'll have to log into a few things because it doesn't copy passwords over.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.480]   But a very easy setup.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.560]   It looks exactly the same as my Pixel 2.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.400]   If you move to Pixel 2.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.920]   And they now do a similar setup if your carrier supports it.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.640]   If you're a Google Fi user, it's funny.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.160]   I took the SIM.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.160]   I'm so used to it.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.800]   I took the SIM pop or pop the SIM slot out of my Pixel 2.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   There's no SIM in it.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.440]   I went, when I realized they don't do SIMs anymore, it's seamless.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   Why?
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.440]   I'm seamless.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.680]   So if you're on Google Fi or I presume other carriers supported, it'll do that automatically.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.440]   You just say, yeah, I'm with Google Fi.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.720]   And it goes, oh, okay, fine.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   You want to transfer everything the number over?
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.880]   And so now this is my phone.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.440]   What do you think, Kevin?
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.240]   You like to feel?
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.240]   I do.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.200]   It's a little bit big for my hands.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.960]   But it feels really well made.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.840]   It is an all glass back.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.640]   And yet this bottom third or two thirds is frosted glass.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.480]   It's frosted gorilla glass.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.920]   So it has that soft touch feel, which is amazing to me.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.200]   But I don't think it's slippery.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.000]   I don't feel like it's slippery at all.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   No.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.920]   Of course, you use cases, don't you, Stacey?
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.600]   You're not going to go caseless.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.040]   But I use cases in part because I don't trust my ability to hold onto these things.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.600]   Well, I think you'd probably want to get a case on this too because it's definitely
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.400]   a nice round of my phone once a week.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.480]   So I always get these standardized-- this is from Ringkey, R-I-N-G-K-E.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.240]   But there's millions of companies.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.480]   Under $10, just rubber sleeve, it gives it grip.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.200]   It doesn't protect the front, but it protects the sides and the back.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   I don't know.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   I'm excited.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.800]   Friday, Lisa and I are going to go to San Francisco and we're going to go do some photo
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.280]   shoot in Chinatown, try to get some low light and different kinds of pictures so we could
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.120]   show them on the new screensavers and next week on this show.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.200]   If you do any more portraits, the setting for depth, changing the depth after the fact,
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.360]   it's not with the filters.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.400]   It's the next one over where you would edit the light color, et cetera.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.440]   Thank you for doing that research.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440]   Sure.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440]   So it's--
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.840]   The little slider next to the share.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   Not that one.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.840]   Yep.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.080]   That one.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.640]   And then--
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.320]   Click it again.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   This one?
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.600]   Yeah, the slide depth.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   Yes.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.280]   Oh, look at that.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.440]   Oh, that's pretty sweet.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.440]   Okay.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.440]   Change the bokeh.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.040]   Now, look at where it's challenging for all these phones is the hair.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.400]   Look at that stranded hair on the right.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   Let's see.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.160]   Yes, see, it's gone out of focus.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.600]   And though it's in the same roughly same focal plan as your head, those are always the challenging
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.440]   things to figure out what's part of her and what's not.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.080]   And it looks like there's some trouble with her fingers as well.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   Let's see.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.320]   No, not too bad.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.080]   The knuckles have gone out of focus.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.840]   Who wants their knuckles in focus?
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.840]   It's wrinkly and--
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   I know.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   That's unfocused.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.040]   Yeah, you see the pinky?
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.240]   It shouldn't really be going out of focus with the table, but it is.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.840]   My knuckles are my best feature.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.840]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.360]   I'm going to discard changes.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.760]   I think it's a great shot, though.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.360]   What you need, though, is that ring to be in focus.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.760]   Other pop on the ring.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.000]   Zoom in and the ring, huh?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.360]   Yeah, I mean, that's what people are going to be looking at.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   That's what they're looking at.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.040]   Actually, her hair pieces looked really good there when you zoomed in on it.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.960]   Yes, because it's all in the rough focus.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.840]   But see this?
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.000]   This is actually a perfect example.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.080]   Yeah, that strand is in focus above the table.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.080]   Ah, yes.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.080]   Okay, I do see.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.680]   And then out of focus below the table.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.280]   That's exactly the problem.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.240]   And apples of portra-moan has exactly that problem as well.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.200]   It's unfortunate because, but you know what?
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.680]   You have to really pixel-peep to see it.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.560]   If you're looking at the picture, if you looked at this on Instagram, unless you're
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.400]   looking for it, you're going to say, "No, no, that looks great."
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.120]   So I think that's the lighting and the color.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.840]   Now, Kevin, not every feature's turned on on this camera yet, right?
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.840]   See, I can't figure that out because the whole night sight thing, I think, is not there
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.200]   yet, and I've seen some reviewers saying, "Look at these dark photos that we took at
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   night sight."
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   They're not even doing it.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.680]   Yeah, I don't think it did.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.440]   And they're not even that good, so I'm thinking not.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.320]   I think not either because I'm getting motion blur with this low light.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.480]   And one thing we know is it'll go as low as a quarter of a second, which you cannot hand-hold
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.160]   a quarter of a second.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.720]   It'll have blur in it.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.200]   And the people will be blurry.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.560]   When that night sight comes in, it's going to take, what do they say, 15 images and then
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.400]   pick and choose image stuff, and it'll be able to do that.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.240]   Some of the images will be as slow as a quarter of a second, but not all.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   I wish they had actually had that in the demo room at the event saying, "Here, we've
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.160]   got this dark area set up, and this one device has night sights.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.160]   You get an idea."
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:57.080]   What all we got was the comparison of the XS versus the Pixel 3 on stage.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:03.840]   I think 3.9 million of these last year, that's all Google sold.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:11.400]   It's a minor blip in the phone universe, less than a week's worth of iPhone sales.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.920]   But I think we're Google fans.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.240]   This is, to me, this is the Android phone of choice, if you ask me.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   It is big.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   We're this week in Google.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.240]   Come on.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:28.000]   It's not this week in iPhones.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.480]   All right, enough of that.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.480]   Let me take a break.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.480]   We'll come back.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.840]   We've shown you the Pixel.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.320]   Maybe before the show's over, we'll get the charging stand.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:42.920]   One of the questions I had on the charging stands is they showed some special stuff that
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.920]   it happens when it's on the charging stand.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.040]   Well, after looking in the settings, it looks like that special stuff also can be on any
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.720]   time it's charging.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.600]   It's like the clock and dimming and all that stuff.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   I don't know.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   Really?
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.440]   Yeah, the one thing that I don't know about yet is the slideshow, right?
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.320]   That's where they're duplicating the home hubs slideshow capability.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   Have you figured that out yet?
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.280]   Yeah, I've got the live albums on there.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.920]   I also tested the Nest doorbell integration.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.600]   After the break, I can share.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.000]   But do you have to have the question is, do you have to have the Google wireless charger
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.480]   for that to work?
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   I believe so.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.560]   I suspect there's an NFC bit in the charger.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:28.240]   I'm taking a guess because I have a Samsung wireless charger and it charges the phone rapidly,
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.480]   but I don't get any of those extra features.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480]   Oh, you don't.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   Okay.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.480]   Good.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.480]   Never mind.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.480]   So apparently there's a Pixel stand app that turns on all of those features.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.920]   Somebody in the chat room says the stand app came out today.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.400]   I don't have a stand app and I never got one.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   But it works.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.800]   Maybe they put it on there just for you.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   Maybe, maybe.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   I don't know.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   I'll see it.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   I don't know.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   All right.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.920]   Well, let's see what the stand app does.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.840]   We'll go to the break and figure this out while you're reading it.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.480]   That's what the ads are for.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.840]   Okay, everybody, go make a sandwich.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.200]   No, it's time to talk about cash fly.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.160]   The show is brought to you literally by the folks at cash fly.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.660]   That's our CDN, our content distribution network.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:22.000]   If you're in the business of getting data to customers, whether it's a podcast and app,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.240]   I think a lot of businesses these days, in fact, could use a CDN.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.520]   Content distribution network is designed to give you high speed downloads for your customers.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.960]   Part of the way that works at cash fly works is because it has multiple servers all over
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   the world.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.980]   So when you download Twit, you're getting it from a server near you.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.520]   That really does make a difference.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.120]   But the thing I love about cash fly.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.020]   We've been using them since we started using CDNs.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.860]   I've used them the whole time from, I think a decade now on Twit.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:59.940]   The cash fly has been building trusted CDN relationships since 2002 is 100% availability
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.460]   with a bulletproof 100% SLA.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.100]   That means you're never down.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.060]   That means no more 3 AM phone calls.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.060]   The cash, the servers down, the CDNs down.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.860]   No, I love it.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.020]   I really love it.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.700]   We have never had a problem without it as a cash fly.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.120]   Plus, the price is right.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:24.420]   Cash fly, on average, saves customers more than 20%.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:30.420]   Actually, I'll tell you how you can find out exactly how much they'll save you.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:35.980]   They've got the best agile techs that will answer all your questions the first time without
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.600]   passing you around to five different departments.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.060]   Really smart people.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:50.220]   We have a great relationship with them because our cash fly contract is based on our usages.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.740]   We're not locked into an inflexible contract.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.420]   Our contract with cash flies built around our unique demand and traffic patterns.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:04.300]   We literally send out petabytes of data every month from the Twit servers on cash fly.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.300]   Petabytes.
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.380]   Knowing that it's not going to suddenly hit me if one show gets a lot of downloads, it's
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.380]   awesome.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.140]   I don't have to check my CDN bill every day to see if, "Are we okay?
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.620]   Did we exceed our limits?"
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.620]   etc.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.620]   etc.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.620]   I love cash fly.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.020]   Join the thousands of others who trust cash flies.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.260]   Reliable network.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.540]   Like cash fly give you some sanity back.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.540]   No more 3 a.m. phone calls.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.500]   You want to find out how much cash fly I can save you?
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.780]   They're giving away a complete detail analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.420]   If you go right now to twit.cash fly.com.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:45.140]   See if you might be leaving 20% or more on the table.
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.820]   You already use cash fly every time you download one of our shows so you know how good it
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.820]   is.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.820]   Twit.
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.900]   The cash fly.com.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.620]   You know who could have used cash fly yesterday?
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.620]   Google, YouTube.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.620]   YouTube.
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.900]   So I'm in the chat room yesterday doing the show.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.540]   Somebody's saying, "I'm getting a lot of 500's."
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.900]   I said, "Okay, which of our sites?
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.900]   What is the problem?
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.900]   What's going on?"
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.900]   YouTube.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:15.540]   Yeah, it went off right in the middle of the Beto Ted Cruz debate.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.140]   So I was sitting there talking to my dad who is politically on the other side of the fence
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.140]   for me.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.300]   And we're like having this nice text based go round.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.460]   And then he's like, "Ah!"
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.100]   And I was like, "Score for Beto!"
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.500]   And he's like, "No, YouTube just went down."
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:37.820]   It affected users in the US, Australia, Asia and Europe.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.900]   The service was back up around 11 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.620]   I don't know if Google has explained what happened, but you would have gotten a...
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.900]   He hasn't had a post-mortem yet.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.540]   Yeah, network 503 error.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:59.580]   Southeast Asia also affected Team YouTube on Twitter because nobody would read their
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.580]   Google+ page.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:05.260]   Team YouTube said, "Thanks for your reports about YouTube, YouTube TV and YouTube music
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.260]   access issues.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.020]   They're all on the same CDN.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.020]   We're working on resolving this.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.220]   We'll let you know once it's fixed.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.220]   We apologize for any convenience."
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:20.700]   Would it be funny if YouTube moved to cash fly because of this?
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.980]   Does YouTube have a dashboard for services?
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.980]   That's a good...
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.980]   They ought to.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.980]   Google does.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.980]   Google has one for other services.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.980]   So Google...
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.980]   Oh, it's under Google.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   Okay.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.980]   It is.
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:33.980]   It is.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:34.980]   In the World Cup.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.660]   Remember it going down?
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.980]   YouTube TV.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.340]   That was incredibly frustrating.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.500]   I was watching the game.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:48.940]   And here's the Google Cloud status dashboard.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.940]   That doesn't have YouTube.
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.940]   That's for their professional.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.140]   Oh, that's the enterprise type stuff in Cloud stuff.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.140]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.140]   That's how it should go.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.700]   It's just a billion people.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.860]   Just a billion people.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.140]   It was like an important game too.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.740]   I can't remember, but I was really peeved.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.220]   They're all important in World Cup.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.020]   They're all important.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.220]   I'm a big football guy.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.220]   Sorry.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.060]   If it's a sporting event, it's super important to someone.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.060]   If it's a debate between Beto and what's "cruzy"...
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.060]   Ted Cruz.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.700]   What is "cruises"?
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.500]   What is Donald Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz?
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.300]   "Lion Ted."
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.260]   Lion Ted.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:30.300]   Is it allowed for Beto to use lion Ted or is that trademark Trump properties?
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.020]   I don't think Beto really wants to be like Trump.
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.020]   That's my launch.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.020]   Lion Ted.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:39.140]   Didn't Ted Cruz's family assassinate President Kennedy?
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.740]   Am I wrong on that?
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.740]   I've heard people say that.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.740]   Yes.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.780]   He couldn't have been his dad because he was the Zodiac killer.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.780]   Oh, that's right.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.780]   He had to be busy.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.780]   Do I have to?
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.780]   Cruz was the Zodiac killer.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.780]   Oh, well maybe maybe...
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:55.900]   No, he's Grandpa Munster on TV's Munsters show.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.380]   We shouldn't get into this.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.380]   Your dad will hate us.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.380]   Nope, nope.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.380]   Nope.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.980]   So we don't know yet what's going on.
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.940]   We don't know why YouTube went down and I presume it didn't have anything to do with
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.180]   the debate.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.020]   Probably not, no.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.460]   No.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.700]   So this is interesting and when you get your Pixel stand, you'll see what I see I think.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.980]   There is no Pixel stand app on my Pixel 3.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.980]   Oh.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.100]   Instead, in fact Leo, you probably can go see this.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.740]   In the settings of the phone, there's a connected devices option where you do do two
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.740]   things out of C.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.940]   You click in there and it doesn't show up in there either but because I've already paired
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:44.020]   my phone to the Pixel stand, I go into previously connected devices and I have Pixel stand showing
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.460]   up in there with settings.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.960]   Aha.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.100]   And in the settings, I can tell it, here's what I want to do.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.860]   I can turn the screen off after dark.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.580]   I can do not disturb.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:58.340]   The neat thing is, and I found this out through Android Police while you're doing the ad,
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:02.720]   you can have multiple stands and configure them differently when it worked, when it
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   worked, when it worked.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.020]   Yeah, because it's by pairing.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.020]   It is.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.420]   So there has to be some communication method.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.860]   In fact, Android Police says they've checked it on a Pixel 2 even with the Pixel stand
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.860]   app installed and it doesn't give you these options and features.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.460]   So you may be able to get the app but I don't think it's going to do anything for you.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:24.900]   Keep your eye peeled, John, for my Google box.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.660]   I thought they'd be doing it together.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.620]   I'll have to turn Bluetooth off and put it in the stand and see if I still get the features
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.620]   and whatnot because maybe it's Bluetooth but I think it's NFC.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.020]   I think it would make more sense.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:40.140]   But if it's, oh yeah, I guess it all could be stored in the phone.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.340]   Any per stand settings could just be stored in the phone.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.420]   That makes sense.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:49.620]   I really, I have to say, I think this is going to be my daily driver going forward and I
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.540]   have the Note 9 and the S9 and.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.660]   My daily driver, is that your phone?
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:01.060]   Yes, that's what we, YouTubeers call our phone.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.900]   I was like, what does that mean?
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.100]   Daily, the phone we use every day.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.260]   Once every couple of weeks on our podcast, our T podcast, I have to tell her, this is
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.260]   how the kids say it.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.260]   The kids.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.260]   Do you start a show?
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.260]   Do you start a show?
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.260]   You got to start your show.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.260]   Hi guys.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.940]   Stay so you get a bathroom.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.660]   That's normal.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.660]   That's normal.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.940]   So Google has decided to play hardball with the EU.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.860]   Wow, I'm very curious what you all think about this.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:39.180]   Remember the European commissions decided that Google was competing inappropriately
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.180]   in the EU.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.180]   Find them.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.180]   What was it?
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.180]   $5 billion.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.020]   Google's appealing that fine.
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.460]   But Google said, we've been working.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.500]   This is Hiroshi Lockheimer of Android Talk.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.580]   We've been working on how to comply with the decision.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.620]   We now have formed the European Commission of the Changes we'll make while the appeal
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.620]   is pending.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:04.220]   First, we're updating the compatibility agreements with mobile device makers that say how Android's
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.220]   used.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:11.820]   Going forward, Android partners wishing to distribute Google Apps may also build non-compatible
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.740]   or forked smartphones and tablets for the European economic area.
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.380]   That was one bone of contention.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.660]   Google said, if you want to put our apps on there, which customers want, you can't make
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.460]   an alternative Android AOSP version of your phone.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:31.100]   You have to either be a Google Apps device maker or not.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.340]   I think the argument for that is confusing to consumers.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.580]   A consumer is buying a phone.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.580]   They want to know if they're going to get the Google experience or not.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:45.100]   It's not just an alternate version of a particular phone.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:50.380]   If you sign the arrangement and license the Google Play Store, mobile services and apps,
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.460]   you can't make any non-Google devices.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.660]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.060]   You can't make any non-Android.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.700]   You can't make a Tizen device or something like that.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   No, no, you can do.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.900]   I think you can do Tizen.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.900]   You can't do Android.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:03.900]   Android.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.660]   Can you use AOSP any other way?
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.660]   Right.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.660]   It's AOSP Android or Google Android, as I would say.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.740]   If you do Google Android, you cannot make any non-Google Android devices.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:19.380]   When somebody actually tried that, it was Acer or SUSE and the product was launched
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.100]   and quickly squashed.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.100]   Well, that's changed.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.620]   That was one of the things that your competition commission didn't like.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.420]   Google says, "Now, if you're an Android partner and you want to have a Google phone, you can
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.460]   also build non-compatible phones or forked smartphones."
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.820]   By the way, notice that's for the European economic area only.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.820]   Right.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.740]   That also means theoretically Amazon could make Google devices.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.140]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.420]   But here's where they're playing a little hardball.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:56.900]   Device manufacturers will be able to license the Google mobile application suite separately
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.500]   from the Google search app or the Chrome browser.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.660]   Since the pre-installation of Search and Chrome together with our other apps helps us, or
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.420]   helped us, used to help us fund development and free distribution of Android, we're going
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.820]   to make you pay.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.980]   We're going to introduce a new paid licensing agreement.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.540]   Android is free and open source, but if you want the Google apps and you're in the EU,
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.340]   you're going to pay a fee now.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.460]   And this is for the companies who are building this network.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.460]   Yeah.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:29.940]   But the companies pass it along, so it means a more expensive phone, I think.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.540]   What's unclear is what the fee will be.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:38.540]   But what is very clear is this is Google saying, "All right, EU.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.020]   People show you, we'll comply, but it's going to cost you."
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.180]   Most importantly, it's going to cost EU consumers.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.180]   Or will it?
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.180]   Right.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:54.420]   And I only say that because the details are not here, and I've been hearing some back
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:33:01.060]   chatter that companies such as a Samsung or Nokia or whoever, for EU phones, yes, they'll
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:06.300]   pay Google to license it, but then Google would actually give them some incentive back.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.700]   So it may just be an accounting wash.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.700]   I don't know.
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.900]   I'm very curious to see the details of all that.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.180]   Well, that was part of the problem is that Google was apparently paying some companies
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.820]   to use Google apps.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.660]   But you know what, this happens all the time.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.820]   And I worked in the cable industry.
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.060]   I'm familiar with this with tech TV.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:33.380]   In theory, the way cable television works is the individual cable companies, you know,
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:38.500]   or Austin Cable pays tech TV for the right to carry that programming.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:44.740]   But the way tech TV gets on Austin Cable is by going to them with a bag of money saying,
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:50.540]   "Between you and me, we're paying you to take our channel for the first five years,
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.300]   and then you could start paying us per subscriber."
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.460]   What they call it is co-marketing dollars.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:02.260]   They say, "If this is money to help you advertise the fact that you have tech TV now, don't
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.140]   worry about spending it all on billboards."
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:08.380]   Whatever you deem necessary is sufficient.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.220]   And so we would pay them, and then five years later, the contract flips and they start paying
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.700]   us, which is why it costs.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:20.180]   And I remember when I first, I worked for, I was a third employee of CNET back in the
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.380]   early '90s.
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.420]   And maybe the fourth was the third of the fourth.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:31.260]   And I was charged with at the time, Halsey Miner and Shelby Bonny wanted to start a television
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.020]   network, not a website.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.540]   And they said, "But we want to know how much that's going to cost, so I did some due diligence
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.100]   for them as my first task."
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:45.140]   And I said, "Guys, it's going to cost you about 50 million a year, and it's going to
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.980]   take you, CNN took 10 years to turn it around.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.620]   It's going to take you at least five years.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:56.940]   So you need a war chest of a quarter of a billion dollars to start a cable channel."
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.940]   And that's roughly, I think, what Paul Allen spent, the late Paul Allen, who has a tip of
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.260]   the hat and passed away this week.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:10.860]   When he put tech TV out there, he lost hundreds of millions of dollars because it hadn't turned
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.340]   yet.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.380]   Which is why the internet is so amazing.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.380]   Yes.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.420]   I don't have to pay anybody.
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:21.980]   We have the irony is more people can watch this show than ever could watch a tech TV show
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.620]   by a factor of 100.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620]   Literally.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.060]   And I don't have to pay anybody anything.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.060]   I shouldn't lie.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.660]   I don't have to pay cash fly.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.380]   Yeah, we have distribution costs, but I don't have to pay your...
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.700]   And by the way, this is where net neutrality does impact us.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.820]   I don't have to pay your internet service provider for access to you.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:48.220]   Since many internet service providers are former cable companies like Comcast and AT&T
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:51.660]   and Verizon, they're kind of used to the model of us coming with bags of cash.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.660]   They wish we would.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.660]   Right.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.140]   Who wouldn't want a bag of cash?
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.500]   Who wouldn't want a bag of cash?
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   What a tangled web.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.620]   Anyway, do you think this is Google?
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:08.060]   It really feels like a school boy thing like, "Well, if you're going to make me do that,
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.260]   I'm going to charge you."
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.060]   Or is this legitimately, "Well, they need to recoup their expensive developing Android."
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.500]   Well, I mean, let's put it this way.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:24.660]   We know that what is the 80, 90 percent of their revenue comes from ads.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.860]   If they don't have their search engine and their browser and their Play Store on particular
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.140]   phones, they can't make money from ads.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.020]   So I think it's legitimate to license.
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.820]   I don't have a problem with it.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.060]   I'm more concerned from a consumer standpoint and not cost.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:47.380]   If I'm a consumer in the EU and I want a phone, and let's say I get the non-Googleized
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:51.220]   version of it, but then later I want to add the Play Store.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.220]   Can I do that?
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.220]   Can I pay Google?
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.220]   Can I...
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.300]   Can I just stuck?
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.820]   I suspect I'm stuck.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:07.620]   The chatroom has told me that this in psychology is called reactants.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:13.820]   An unpleasant motivational arousal to offers persons rules or regulations that threaten
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:17.660]   or eliminate specific behavioral freedoms.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.020]   Reactants occurs when a person feels that someone is taking away their choices or limiting
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.940]   the range of alternatives.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:29.860]   And that's how reverse psychology works, because if you want somebody to do something
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.500]   you tell them, don't do that.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.020]   And then reactants kicks in.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.180]   Who knew Google was acting like a 10-year-old?
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.180]   Oh, aren't they 20?
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.340]   Come on, Google.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.340]   Stop the adolescence.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.340]   I mean, Google...
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.900]   Paul Therap pointed this out on one of his weekly earlier.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.180]   They already got what they wanted with Android, which is complete dominance, and they killed
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.220]   any other third-party operating system.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.700]   It's iOS or Android, and that's that.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:58.700]   And this is...
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.260]   I mean, I will say this is what the regulators did ask for.
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:08.260]   And now if you're like, "Oh, I don't want to pay Google this," then maybe you build
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.300]   your own stuff that competes with Google.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.620]   I don't know.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.780]   Is this ideal?
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.820]   In a lot of the...
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:22.140]   In the new era of internet hegemony, a lot of the thinking about competition law...
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:28.020]   Is actually going to cause maybe some pain for consumers in terms of higher prices.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.020]   So that's another...
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:36.300]   In Europe, which has a very different kind of monopolistic viewpoint than in the US,
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.900]   that's actually what they're after.
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.620]   So I don't know.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.620]   And the Europeans may be okay with it.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:49.060]   Well, they should be happy because today, if you go by, say, a Samsung phone, I'm not
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.740]   picking on Samsung, just using them as an example.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.380]   You get the Google stuff, you get your Gmail account, an app, rather, because you have
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.540]   to, but you also have Samsung's email.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.540]   You have the Google Calendar.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.540]   You also have Samsung Calendar.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.700]   There's a lot of duplication, and that's not good for consumers.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.700]   But again, will they have...
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.540]   Do you want to argue that it is good for consumers?
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.540]   It's good to have you in that.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:19.300]   I mean, oh, not loaded on your phone necessarily, not like bloatware, but the option of having
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.300]   two different email choices.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.620]   Oh, I'm all for choice.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.620]   Absolutely.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.620]   I don't have a problem with it.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:25.620]   Okay.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:33.860]   My point is Samsung wants to develop its own apps, but it's also required to put Google's
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   apps on its phone.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.860]   So that's why there's duplication.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.540]   It's a bad consumer experience is my point.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.100]   So that's a good thing to get rid of that, just to have one or the other or choice.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:47.380]   But in a sense, if you buy a Samsung phone that's not Google licensed, you're not going
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.380]   to have that choice.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.140]   I mean, you're not going to have the choice of Gmail anyway.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.060]   You'll have your choice of any other email app, including Samsung's.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:57.460]   And that's an issue because really what other good app stores are there.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.100]   Samsung has an app store, yes.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.220]   Amazon has an app store.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.860]   But there's a lot of moving parts here that I just don't know.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.700]   Everybody says, "Oh, you just sideload Google this.
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.100]   And yes, I can do that."
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.420]   And probably the people who watch the show can do that.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.740]   That's not a mainstream consumer answer, though.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.740]   No.
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.740]   It's also not illegal.
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:16.740]   Is that...
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.820]   You see that all the time when you put a new ROM on there or whatever, the ROMs don't come
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:21.820]   with the Google Apps.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.700]   You have a sideload of G apps and you install it.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.100]   Is that legal?
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.100]   How does Google feel about that?
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.580]   I've always wondered.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.420]   They probably don't care, Leo, because they're getting what they want anyway.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.980]   They're getting more users and data.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.980]   So they don't care.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.020]   Maybe they will care now that this goes into the...
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:44.420]   They'll care if Samsung now says, "Well, Samsung's not going to come with the Google
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.700]   Apps, but here's where you get them, wink, wink, nudge."
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.700]   Right.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.340]   That is not going to be how that plays out.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:55.540]   And also, again, a lot of moving parts of Google Play services is a big piece of all
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.740]   these apps and services.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.740]   Right.
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.940]   Google's not giving that away for free.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.420]   You can't download that either, right?
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.420]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.420]   Used to be able to.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:09.380]   And if you get away from the actual Google Play Store, I'm not saying that's the best
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.860]   place in the world, because it's not.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.660]   But if you get away from it and you start losing the security it offers through Google
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:19.620]   Play Protect, where they do the machine learning scanning and on-device scanning.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.300]   So are you opening yourself up to more malware and whatnot?
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.300]   I don't know.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.020]   There's a lot of moving parts here.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.180]   I certainly don't recommend.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.420]   I mean, honestly, I just tell people...
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.820]   I guess the Samsung phones are right.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.300]   I like some of the Samsung's phones.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.540]   But when people I care about ask me what Android phone to get, I always say, "Just get
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.300]   a pixel, period."
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.500]   No second choice, because you know you're going to get all the Google updates.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   It's going to be clean.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.500]   It's not going to have...
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.260]   I mean, I like the Samsung hardware.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.260]   If Samsung...
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.620]   We've said this before, if Samsung did their Google experience phones again, where they
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.300]   just put in a lain-o-end right on there, and buy that in a heartbeat.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.020]   But they don't, and they won't.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.020]   Si.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.020]   Si.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.020]   You know what?
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.020]   This is pretty...
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.020]   Now they're using Samsung panels.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.020]   This is pretty close.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.820]   This is pretty close.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.420]   It's pretty close.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.180]   It's almost a Samsung.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.580]   That's what Google should sell it as.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.340]   It's practically a Samsung without all the junk.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.340]   Let's take a break.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.340]   Oh, no.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.340]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.340]   We'll take a break in a second.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:26.260]   But first, and I thank Cara Swisher for pointing this to me, pointing me to this and all of
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:33.540]   us to this on Twitter, a very long thread by Morgan Knudson.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.540]   Did you read this?
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.540]   I did.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.540]   Twice.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:41.340]   Well, I don't know if I read all of it, because I think he kept adding to it after
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.340]   it.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.340]   It's long.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.340]   I read it till he's finished.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.340]   I read like hundreds of something tweets.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.540]   I was like, "Oh."
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.140]   This is the argument for please people.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.140]   Stop with the tweet storm.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.140]   Just put it on medium.
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.140]   Would you have please?
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.740]   So pain, they read this.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.340]   Is someone to unroll it yet?
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.020]   No, we need something like that.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.860]   So let's just describe this.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.860]   Knudson is no longer at Google.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.140]   Hasn't been for a long time effect.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.900]   He's had some successful startups.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.660]   He's well past the Google days.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.980]   But he started the tweet storm with, "Now the Google+ has been shuttered."
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:16.620]   Well, it's not shuttered yet, but in the process.
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.380]   I should air my dirty laundry.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.900]   Oh, oh, that's a good start.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:26.260]   On how awful the project and exec team was.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.260]   I'm still pissed about the bait and switch they pulled me by telling me I'd be working
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:37.380]   on Chrome, then putting me on this God forsaken piece of poop on day one.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.420]   It gets worse from there.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.940]   It's very detailed.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:47.300]   It's not only so detailed, but it's so credible.
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.740]   That's what I want to ask you guys.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.380]   It feels to me so credible.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.020]   It's really changed my opinion about how well Google's organized.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.820]   And he does say there's some really great teams.
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.540]   He mentioned he worked with Andy Hertzfeld and it was just amazing because remember Andy
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.420]   worked on Google+.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:11.900]   But in general, it slams Vic Gundotra saying he was just, let's see here.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.340]   If I can find it.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.260]   Yeah, there's like, is it 180?
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.260]   It goes on and on and on.
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.580]   He's talking first about Larry Page.
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:22.580]   Google+ was situated.
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:26.420]   Remember, this was when Google was all in on social.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.140]   Google+ was situated in the main building, 1900, a floor away from Larry's office, Larry
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.860]   Page CEO.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.700]   If you were one of the 12,000 people at Google in Mountain View who didn't work on plus,
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.220]   you didn't have access to those floors.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.460]   The CEO, Larry Page, didn't just have an office.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.500]   The entire floor was his.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:48.060]   We all had access to it and we're encouraged to use it sparingly.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.220]   A warm room here and there.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:56.020]   We had access to Larry's cafe too, a super fancy vegan cafe called Cloud that wouldn't
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:59.100]   be sustainable in the real world.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.180]   Why this exclusivity?
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.620]   What made Google+ so special?
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.300]   Why was it held so closely to Google's chest?
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:08.900]   I'd find out later that the senior vice president of plus uses Cloud to swing all of
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.900]   this.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.460]   His name was Vic Gundotra.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:17.180]   Now Vic has since left and that's really the timing of Vic's departure is really kind
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:22.820]   of coincident with the decline in fall of Google+.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.500]   Condotra was relatively charismatic.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:29.620]   I remember him frequently flirting with the women on the team gave me a compounded, horrible
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.740]   impression of him.
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.900]   My desk was directly next to Vic's glass walled office.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.820]   He'd walk by my desk dozens of times during the day.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.580]   I'd see my screen from his desk.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:43.300]   During the eight months I was there, culminating in me leading the redesign of his product.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.740]   Vic didn't say a word to me.
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:50.260]   "Hello, no, goodbye, no thanks for staying late, no handshake, no eye contact."
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.420]   Vic's product vision was fear based.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.740]   Google built the knowledge base, knowledge graph.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.540]   Facebook swooped in and built the social graph.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.540]   If we don't own the social graph, we can't claim to have indexed all the world's data,
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.020]   which you know, that didn't make sense at the time.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.060]   Vic was powerful at Google.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.500]   He had buy-in from the top and he wielded that stick aggressively.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:16.140]   He made pluses pervasive as he could, each product org that's every product through Google
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.980]   had a mandate to integrate Google+'s social features.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:24.740]   If your team, say on Gmail or Android, had to integrate Google+ features, then your team
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:30.620]   would be awarded a one and a half to three times multiplier on top of your yearly bonus,
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:35.900]   making it almost half of your entire salary.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.540]   Oh, it goes on and on and on.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.500]   It's kind of hard to follow because after you get to the end of one thread, you have
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.060]   to then click on it and go on to the...
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.060]   You read that correctly.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:50.460]   A ton of money to ruin the product you were building with bloated garbage no one wanted.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.860]   No one really liked this, but people drank the Kool-Aid mostly because it was green and
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.420]   made of paper.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.620]   This made plus the center of the Google universe and made Vic feel invincible.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.580]   I presume.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:05.580]   Once I had to hold back laughter after he announced his brilliant idea to redesign the product
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:14.340]   from the ground up every six months.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.340]   It goes on.
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.340]   I recommend reading it.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:21.580]   Morgan Knudson, M-O-R-G-A-N-K-N-U-T-S-O.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:28.180]   My takeaway was how disorganized Google was, how petty politics had influenced it to the
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:31.100]   point where people weren't doing their best work.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.460]   They were often assigned projects.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:36.500]   They didn't have the capability of handling.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.580]   It's not a pleasant picture at all.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.580]   What do you guys think?
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.580]   What do you think, Stacy?
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:49.380]   I think it shows that Google is like every other crappy big company out there.
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:54.460]   They used to have a lock on this idea that they were this idealistic group.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.380]   I think some of that halo effect still lives.
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.940]   We know that Google is not trying not to be evil.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.340]   We know that there's a gajillion people there.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:10.220]   I think if anything, this shows how a halo effect from your early culture can really help
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.220]   you.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:15.460]   The flip side of that, look at companies like Uber now and how they behave and how long
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:20.140]   is that effect, even if they're not crazy jerks in the world.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.940]   How long is that going to stick with them?
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:27.740]   Can I tie to this, the story from The New Yorker, by the way?
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.060]   I don't know if you saw that.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.060]   This was in The New Yorker.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.060]   It's about Waymo.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:38.420]   I think it was yesterday or maybe the day before that someone pulled this up.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:48.100]   It's talking about an argument between Levindalski and his colleague at Google where it describes
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:53.060]   Levindalski pulling the software and allowing it to self-driving car software, allowing it
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:58.580]   to take forbidden routes and then basically driving a Camry off the road so they do a
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.100]   fine for the work Camry.
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:03.820]   They didn't report this.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.300]   It doesn't look like they reported it.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:14.260]   It screwed up his colleagues back so badly this particular accident that he had to get
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.260]   like surgery.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.980]   One day in 2011, a Google executive named Isaac Taylor learned that while he was on
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:25.140]   the paternity leave, Levindalski had modified the Camry software so that he could take them,
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:29.500]   actually all the car software, so that he could take them on otherwise forbidden routes.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.940]   A Google executive recalls witnessing Taylor and Levindalski shouting at each other.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:37.860]   Levindalski told Taylor the only way to show him why his approach is necessary was to take
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.940]   a ride together.
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:44.420]   Both men still furious, jumped into a self-driving Prius and headed off.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.780]   The car went onto a freeway where it traveled past an on-ramp.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.780]   According to people with knowledge of events that day, the Prius accidentally boxed in
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:55.940]   another vehicle, a Camry, a human driver could easily have handled the situation by slowing
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:00.020]   down and letting the Camry merge into traffic, but Google's software wasn't prepared for
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.300]   this scenario.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:05.340]   The car's continued speeding down the freeway side by side.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:08.900]   The Camry's driver jerked his car into the right shoulder that apparently trying to avoid
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:13.060]   a guardrail he veered to the left, the Camry pinwheeled across the freeway and into the
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.060]   medium.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:19.340]   Levindalski was acting as a safety driver, swerved hard to avoid colliding with the Camry, and
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:26.460]   cost Taylor to injure his spine so severely he eventually required multiple surgeries.
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:30.460]   They didn't go back to check on the other driver to see if anyone had been hurt.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:33.180]   Neither they nor other Google executives made inquiries with the authorities.
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:37.220]   The police were not informed of the self-driving algorithm it contributed to the accident.
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.580]   Basically, it was a hit and run.
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:46.660]   Instead of being upset about this happening, which I think would be horrifying, he's like,
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.020]   "Yeah, that's valuable data that we now have."
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:54.700]   He set out an email with video of the collision, subject line Prius versus Camry.
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:55.700]   Yes.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.900]   He was proud of it.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:03.460]   This is not a culture that we want doing really anything.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:10.260]   Yeah, so it ties into nothing that this thread had in it surprises me.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:18.220]   It's basically like a bunch of frat bros who have the engineering capabilities to be oblivious
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.220]   to the rest of the world.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.220]   I don't even know.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:23.420]   It fits all the terrible stereotypes that you have.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.500]   In response to questions about these incidents from the New Yorker, Google's self-driving
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.740]   unit disputed that its cars are unsafe.
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.180]   Safety is our highest priority.
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:35.700]   A spokesperson wrote to the author, "The company said in the case of this collision, a report
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:38.580]   was submitted to the authorities.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:42.340]   Even though multiple participants later sought medical care, "Every person involved left
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.420]   a scene on their own accord," or Camry.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.580]   As for the Camry incident, the person described it as, "Oh, this is a different incident.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.860]   I'm sorry, the kit collision."
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:55.100]   In the Camry case, the spokesperson said, "An unfortunate single car accident in which
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.500]   another car failed to yield a traffic.
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:05.380]   As Google's self-driving car didn't hit the Camry, Google did not cause the incident."
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:10.380]   That's like insurance speak, but the police totally would.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.460]   Actually maybe they wouldn't cite you for…
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.900]   No, they would still cite you.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.420]   They would cite you for reckless driving, though.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:19.660]   It does raise the question, which the New Yorker also raises, that if Google's not
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:26.020]   reporting that because the self-driving car didn't hit anything, then there may be many
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.660]   other accidents we don't know about that are not reported as accidents but may have
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.660]   been caused by behavior by the self-driving car.
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.620]   A spokesperson for Google declined to discuss the company's reporting policies.
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:41.260]   Yeah, I wouldn't want to discuss that either.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:46.380]   Charles Duhigg writing in the New Yorker New Yorker has been doing such great investigative
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.380]   reporting lately.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.020]   They've really done a great job.
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:52.500]   Yeah, you know, starting in…
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:59.420]   As bad as both of those stories are, I think you hit the nail on the head in the beginning
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:05.940]   about the engineering and the ability to do things that other companies and people aren't
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.940]   doing.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:11.420]   But I can stay with certainty from experience.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.700]   Not everybody is like that at Google.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.940]   I hate to see them all lumped in as frat boys.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.340]   No, I think that's true.
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:20.580]   Even in this tweet storm, he's very clear about that.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.580]   Yes.
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:28.740]   I think it's a function of who's in charge in not just at Google but there is a culture
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.940]   in Silicon Valley that we all recognize.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.540]   I feel most of us recognize it.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:40.820]   It's kind of the move fast and break things taken to maybe the unempathetic extreme if
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:41.820]   we want to call it.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.940]   And so that's kind of what I'm talking about.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:46.420]   Sure, sure.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:51.540]   Morgan, this is something that bedeviled Microsoft for years.
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.540]   The product fiefdoms and exerting their power.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.500]   And he is an example in this tweet storm.
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:01.940]   He says he was working with WebRTC and he had…
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.620]   We figured out a way to integrate Google's…
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:12.220]   Create a sidebar that integrated with other apps into the sidebar.
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:18.420]   So you could have your Gmail, your calendar, your plus all in one place in a sidebar on
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.660]   Google Plus for instance.
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.060]   He says it's January of 2012.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.300]   I'm back in the office because he worked on during Christmas.
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.300]   I showed around.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.300]   People seemed to like it.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:31.660]   Even Greg, his bureaucratic direct report, reluctantly liked it.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:34.500]   Somebody, maybe him, told me I needed to talk to another guy to get buy in on my chat
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.860]   plans.
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.460]   He was the exact that was responsible for it.
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:40.540]   I found him and he was able to give him a quick elevator pitch on what I was going for
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.740]   with RTC.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.460]   The executive said, "Ha, there's no way we're doing that.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.460]   I/Os coming up.
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:49.980]   We've just spent the last four months building a Chrome extension that does something similar.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.860]   If Plus has this, we're going to get laughed off the stage."
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:58.500]   I was like, "But shouldn't all these work together in a sort of your conversations are
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.100]   available wherever you are kind of way?"
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:03.100]   Nope, we're not doing that.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:07.500]   And this explains why we have, you know, hangouts and do all this…
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:12.980]   From the outside, people looking in now kind of can say, "Oh, I get it."
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:13.980]   That's what killed…
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.980]   Well, it was terrible at Microsoft.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.100]   It's a real problem at Microsoft.
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:20.700]   I do think that when you're a company with…
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.980]   And Google has almost 90,000 employees now, I think.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.620]   There's going to be fiefdoms.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.060]   There's going to be politics.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:33.780]   You're going to have politics, but it is also very difficult given how many people in
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:38.980]   different product teams and all the types of products that you're pulling in together
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:39.980]   at Google.
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:43.900]   It's hard to build that and make that work.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:49.380]   It's not just that I came in and I think he kind of solved it at Microsoft by making
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:55.660]   putting response, changing the reporting structure and changing the executive to make it more
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.780]   horizontal and vertical.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:02.020]   If you know it's a problem, you can address it.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.220]   Maybe Sundar's trying.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.220]   Maybe.
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:10.500]   It's always a problem with a giant corporation.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.860]   You've got the innovators dilemma.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.580]   You've got organizational issues.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.380]   It's a hard thing to do.
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.620]   It's unclear what their core product is.
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.020]   This is across all tech companies.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.140]   You're starting to see…
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:28.900]   It is hard to say what arrows you put your wood behind.
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:34.660]   If you're making a widget or several widgets, it's very easy.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:39.140]   If you're on the AI team, are you really optimizing for AI or are you optimizing your
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:43.100]   AI for five different Google products?
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.340]   That's very different.
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:45.780]   It's hard.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:46.780]   I absolutely agree.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:53.620]   The only reason this is of interest is because for me anyway, Google has a very shiny reputation
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:58.660]   as being smarter than everybody else and being above these problems, which other corporations
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.660]   have.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:00.660]   Right.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:03.860]   That's the halo that I think they probably no longer deserve.
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.420]   They probably never did.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:09.180]   I don't know.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.980]   There is still…
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.700]   You still see it in some of the things Google puts out in the world.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.620]   You're like, "Google, that is brilliant."
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.140]   But you are explaining this horribly.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.540]   Come on, man.
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:29.220]   I also think that it's helpful because it helps me understand exactly as you said why
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:33.900]   the messages mess is going on, why stuff doesn't work better together.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:40.100]   When Jeff says, "Why can't my G Suite log in work with these things as well as my consumer
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:41.660]   log in?"
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.500]   It's not necessarily that it's such a hard problem.
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.740]   It's just that those are different fiefdoms and you can't get them to work together and
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.940]   things like that.
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:52.900]   It's definitely not always a technical problem and Google is good at solving the technical
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:57.020]   problems, but when it's something outside of that, it gets challenging.
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.780]   Google is not alone here, by the way.
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:57:59.780]   Apple's lost it.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.780]   It's luster as well.
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:05.100]   It's hard to be what we think these companies are.
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:06.340]   Maybe we put them on a pedestal.
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:09.340]   We shouldn't.
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.660]   Almost certainly we shouldn't.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.220]   Well worth reading anyway.
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:20.740]   Believe it or not, whatever your take is on it, it's a very interesting tweet storm.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:25.540]   I guess I just wish people would stop putting that stuff on Twitter and put it in one place
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.700]   where you can read it and comment on it.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.540]   There are lots of comments on the show.
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.420]   Yeah, but they're all over the place.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.420]   They're all over the place.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.460]   They're in each different tweet.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.460]   It's not practical.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:40.300]   I'll never understand why people do that.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.540]   Why in fact you explained it to me?
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:45.420]   Why do people do that?
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:47.060]   Morgan, why?
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:50.820]   Probably it starts out as a stream of consciousness thing.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.620]   It starts as one or two tweets.
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:55.620]   Yeah, and then you just get in and then you're there.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.660]   So why would you change it?
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.940]   He did it over a couple of days too.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:04.540]   He walked away and came back.
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:07.780]   Somebody has put it in Thread Reader.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:11.700]   Thank you to PS Chops in our chat room.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:18.140]   So I guess Thread Reader is a site that will do this, put all these threads together.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:26.460]   However, if I were to read you the link, you would probably not find it any easier to find.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:38.900]   It's threadreaderapp.com/thread/1049523067506966529.html.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.060]   Thank you.
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.060]   Look how long it is.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.060]   It's a novella.
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.060]   It's a novella.
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:50.420]   Yeah, I can't believe I spent that much time reading it.
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.340]   Are you glad you're up or not?
[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.340]   No, I definitely.
[00:59:54.340 --> 01:00:02.620]   I mean, I always like inside stories of any company just because I'm it's.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.620]   It's also kind of therapeutic.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:08.420]   You're like, oh, my crappy work experience was no different than this other crappy work
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.420]   experience.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.420]   Yes.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.620]   I don't, you know, nice.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.100]   It's nice.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:18.260]   We should just mention Morgan went on to he left Google to go to Dropbox where he said
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.580]   it was a pleasant experience.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.460]   These people weren't mired in BS and politics.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.540]   They were at the top of their games.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.500]   I was so stoked to interview.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.700]   Well, that happens.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:31.980]   I mean, similar companies, you can usually see that like right away.
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.420]   And so he went to Dropbox.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:42.860]   He later started a shift app to buy or sell a used car, which raised $140 million in a
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:48.500]   series D. He's currently working on another startup.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.140]   And so and then it ends.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.180]   He said, I sent a resignation to email to Greg.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.620]   He forwarded it to HR within seconds.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.020]   I sent an email to the company saying goodbye standard practice.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.780]   I got hundreds of heartfelt replies from Google employees felt great and terrible at the
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.740]   same time on my way out.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.860]   Greg tried to chit chat and shake my hand.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:07.860]   I took everything.
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.300]   It took everything in me not to tell him to go F himself.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.340]   I walked past his extended hand and said, nah, man.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.340]   He said, really?
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.620]   I turned around and looked him in the eyes.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.380]   I backed out of the door.
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.460]   Yeah, really.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.460]   The end.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.420]   It was very well written.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:27.260]   I'm telling you, I read it.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.700]   He's teaching this as a screenplay.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.660]   That's what's happening.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.260]   It was very well written.
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:43.980]   Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN with all the recent news about security breaches
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:44.980]   online.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:49.060]   It's hard not to worry what's happening to your data as it floats over the Wi-Fi or
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:55.780]   local coffee shop or hotel or even through your internet service providers portals.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:01.060]   It'd be nice, wouldn't it, to avoid being tracked online by social media sites and marketing
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:08.100]   companies, your mobile or internet service provider to be impervious to hacking, not
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:12.900]   to have your information sold to the highest bidder.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.140]   Take back your privacy.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:21.180]   Use ExpressVPN, the number one VPN service that's going to detect radar.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.500]   Number one, I know you're looking for a good VPN.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.100]   I know you know how VPNs work.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:29.420]   The nice thing about ExpressVPN is it's got apps for every platform they run in the background.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:35.940]   It's one click to turn on the VPN and secure and anonymize your traffic and your hide
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.460]   your IP address.
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.940]   You could surf safely on public Wi-Fi, even at home without being snooped on or having
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.420]   your personal data stolen.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:47.340]   It's less than $7 a month with a 30-day money back guarantee.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:51.940]   If you don't want to hand over your online history to your internet provider or data resellers,
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:03:00.100]   if you don't want to be vulnerable to attacks on open Wi-Fi, ExpressVPN is the answer.
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.820]   ExpressVPN and read their privacy policy.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.500]   You'll feel good about it.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.540]   You'll know your secure.
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:07.900]   Not every VPN is that private.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:08.900]   But most aren't.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.420]   ExpressVPN is really awesome.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   Protect your online activity today.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:20.140]   Find out how you can get an additional three months free with a one-year package at expressvpn.com/tweg.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:30.700]   To get access, VPN.com/tweg, an additional three months when you sign up for a year, expressvpn.com/tweg.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.340]   Your online activity is your business.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.340]   Period.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.340]   Period.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:43.660]   Actually, to that point, DuckDuckGo is saying they've seen a 30% increase in searches over
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:44.660]   the last year.
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:45.660]   Oh, wow.
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:49.700]   You know, a year ago I was using DuckDuckGo, but I kind of stopped.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.820]   I think your story is pretty common.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.380]   DuckDuckGo is an interesting search engine.
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.260]   I think it's decent, right?
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:06.740]   You could on all browsers, you can make it your default search engine.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.260]   But I mean, most people still use Google.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.660]   Spacing why it's difficult.
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:11.660]   Spacing why it's difficult.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.660]   Spacing why it's difficult.
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:13.660]   Spacing why it's difficult.
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:18.020]   I think I switched a device or something that I had it as a default and then I had to switch
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:24.140]   or loaded something on that turned the default off basically and then I didn't put it back.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.620]   And sometimes every now and then I would check to see if Google was better.
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:28.620]   And sometimes it was.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.700]   As a journalist, I really do need.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.700]   That's the problem.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.660]   You can believe in privacy.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:37.340]   You can say I don't like Google and all that, but ultimately a good search engine is worth
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.740]   its weight in gold.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:42.340]   Here's the traffic though on DuckDuckGo over.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:46.180]   This is from January 2011 to January 2019.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.180]   You can see it's a steep increase.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.180]   Wait, 2018?
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.180]   2019.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.180]   January 2019.
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:56.180]   Oh, I guess we haven't gotten there yet, but that's the blank part at the end of the.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:57.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:59.220]   I was like, no Leo.
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.140]   There's a little blank part at the end of the graph.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.340]   See, it says 20.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.340]   You know why?
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.340]   I don't know.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:05.340]   Just because for completeness.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:06.340]   We're almost there.
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:07.340]   We're almost there.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:08.660]   God, that's amazing, isn't it?
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:14.020]   I'm seeing them show up a lot more in my own sites stats from referrals lately.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.020]   Oh, interesting.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.020]   That makes sense.
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.140]   I mean, a highly technically literate audience is going to be the driver.
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:25.460]   I remember when I started pitching Google to my friends way back, I had a friend who.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.420]   What's wrong without Vivista Stacy?
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:32.260]   Yeah, she was like, I don't know if you remember this, but you turned me on to Google way back
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.260]   in.
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.820]   And I was like, holy cow.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.820]   I think it was like a thousand.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.820]   Smart, you are.
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:38.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.300]   So she was like, I always thought you were awesome after that.
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.300]   Oh.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.300]   I was like, yeah.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.660]   Yeah, I am.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.340]   You're right.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.020]   Super awesome.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:54.500]   Do you have a Google Home Hub yet, Kevin?
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.500]   I do not.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.700]   I don't know that anybody does.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:57.700]   Okay.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.340]   Yeah, I ordered one, but it hasn't come yet.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.500]   Yeah, people ordered it.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.780]   I don't know if we're going to order it.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:05.380]   I don't want one.
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.380]   You don't want one.
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:07.380]   Why not?
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.860]   I don't.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.700]   Because it's too small for my use.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.700]   I mean, I'm not saying it's a bad product.
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:12.780]   It's tiny, isn't it?
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:13.780]   It's not.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.780]   It's not.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:15.780]   It's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:16.780]   It's not.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:17.780]   It's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:18.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:19.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:20.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:22.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.780]   I think it's a little bit more expensive.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:48.780]   It's very small.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.780]   It's not the same technology.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.780]   Apparently, Google created something called Android Things.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.780]   You guys are aware of that, I'm sure.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:00.780]   That's what the Lenovo runs on, the JBL, the LG.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:05.020]   Google, for some reason, when they decided to do their own, decided not to use Android
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:11.780]   Things, but instead of use, something Ron says a lot closer to Chromecast.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:15.780]   He does give a really good explanation for this, which is cutting costs.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:16.780]   Cheap.
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.780]   It is cheap.
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:21.780]   It's by far the cheapest thing out there.
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:27.540]   He explains that the chipset that they used is not compatible with Android Things because
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:28.780]   it doesn't have enough memory.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:29.780]   It's true.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:33.300]   Android Things is freaking huge for an IoT device.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:38.060]   Kevin and I have talked about that for years.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:41.660]   It makes sense, but it is a little weird.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:49.540]   It kind of shows how stupid or bifurcated or weird that Google's IoT strategy is after
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.540]   my test.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:51.540]   We can now understand this better, can't we?
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.780]   We're like, "Oh, back to that.
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:58.020]   Google doesn't know what the right or left or any hands are doing."
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:02.140]   It doesn't have a camera, which I thought was really interesting after a Facebook portal
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.140]   announcement.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:09.340]   By the way, Facebook at the time they announced this portal said, "Oh, don't worry.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.340]   We're not going to spy on you.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.820]   We're not going to use anything we gather from it for advertising."
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.940]   Now they said, "Oh, no, actually we are."
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.180]   Just kidding.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:21.780]   At least they did it before you actually could get a device.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:22.980]   Yeah, although I ordered it.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.580]   I don't know what I'm going to do with it.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.580]   Oh, no.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:26.580]   Don't even accept delivery.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:27.580]   No.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.580]   I have to.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.580]   I don't plan to do it.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:30.580]   No.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:31.580]   I don't order it for me.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.540]   I ordered it for you.
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.580]   I ordered it so we could review it.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.580]   We don't want it.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.420]   No, I don't want it either.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.540]   I don't want to do it afterwards.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:41.980]   Put it in a nuclear waste dump.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.980]   I don't know.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.300]   I was going to say, "Don't burn it, but you could recycle it."
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.620]   How is it built for recycling?
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:47.620]   I wonder.
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:48.620]   Well...
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.020]   That's actually a question that I started asking a lot of companies or devices.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.020]   That's right.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.020]   That's right.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.100]   Because I think everything's so throwaway now.
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:57.060]   That's kind of a non-sequitur, but throw it out there.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.060]   But not a non-sequitur.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:01.060]   It's absolutely in fact, that's why I always check with IFixit.
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.940]   They will talk about that all the time.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:07.380]   They're really big on the notion of recyclability and they'll rate this stuff.
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:09.820]   Most of this stuff is not sad to say.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.380]   It's terrible.
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:15.740]   Let me ask this then, Kevin, because you have the Lenovo.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.820]   You think it's going to be better or more functional than a home hub?
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:21.380]   No, because Lenovo's getting...
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.380]   Oh, sorry.
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.380]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.380]   You can answer it.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.380]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:26.380]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.380]   Go ahead, Miss I-O-T.
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:32.700]   The Lenovo is going to get all the functionality of the home hub.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.100]   Right.
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.100]   All of it?
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.580]   Because it was my sense that initially we reviewed the Lenovo.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:42.460]   It lacked a lot of features that just a Google Assistant has.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:43.460]   Right?
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.940]   No, like what?
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:45.940]   No, but yeah.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:46.940]   We couldn't do...
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.940]   What couldn't we do?
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:48.940]   I forgot.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:49.940]   We couldn't play back stuff.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:53.940]   We couldn't play Netflix, but Netflix isn't on a normal Google Assistant either.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.700]   I mean, like a Google Home?
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:57.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:01.980]   But since there's only one family of displays, right?
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:02.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:03.980]   I don't know.
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:06.500]   I have to go back and look at our review.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.500]   I didn't review it.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.820]   I think Jason or Megan did.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:14.300]   But I got the feeling that it wasn't as complete as a product from Google would be.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.100]   Nah, I think the home hub is less...
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.100]   Okay, I'm letting Kevin answer because I'm sorry.
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.100]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.100]   Oh, Kevin.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.100]   Well, I have the sort of display.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.100]   I do.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.100]   She doesn't.
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.100]   Okay.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.100]   In fact, I bought hers and shipped to her.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.100]   Aw.
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.100]   I paid you back.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.100]   I know you paid me back.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:33.100]   Aw.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:34.100]   50 dollars off a Costco.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.100]   She got a deal.
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.100]   You guys are so cute.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.100]   We shop together.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:47.620]   But the smart display, it's supposed to get the pull down gesture that brings the home hub
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:50.660]   information center where you see all of your devices and so on.
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:53.380]   So that's not unique to the Google home hub.
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.820]   That's coming to the other devices, they said.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.620]   It's a Chromecast receiver, both of the Mars.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:02.980]   I can pipe anything I want that I can Chromecast to it or to the Google home hub.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:07.340]   But I wouldn't do that on the seven inch when I can do it on a 10 inch 1080p display.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:12.500]   I don't really see the benefit of having other than lower cost.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.500]   Okay.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.500]   Oh, no.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:19.940]   I was going to say don't they have a brightness sensor that's different for this one.
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.500]   That was only thing Kevin.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.500]   That's worth it.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:27.020]   And then wait a minute, but also the photo slideshow.
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:30.340]   Can you do that Google photos slideshow on a Lenovo?
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.340]   I do it all the time.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:33.340]   All day long, mine shows.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.500]   Because really that's a lot half of what this is is a digital pixel frame, a picture
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.500]   frame, right?
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.500]   Kevin's always on.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.420]   Can you come and shoot with me?
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:45.540]   Because I, where is Google pulling that information from?
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.540]   And this is actually useful for anybody because I know everything, though.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:56.780]   My Google home, it only pulls from two options for my slideshows and their crappy options.
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:59.380]   It doesn't pull from all of my Google photos.
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:04.740]   So right off the bat, the live photos that they counted with this new Google Home Hub
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:08.860]   where it automatically adds pictures of a person or pet.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.540]   That's not even available yet.
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:14.540]   So we don't have that on the Lenovo and Google Home Hub doesn't have it either.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:18.740]   But you should be able to do it in your Google Home app.
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.020]   Because that's right there because I just have an album of norm just going all day long
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.020]   when I want.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.460]   And then I switch it to pictures of Earth and whatnot.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:29.420]   So it should be in the Home app, say.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:34.740]   So I have it in the Home app and it says, hey, we'll pull it from Google Photos on the Google
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:38.100]   account that I use for most of my personal photos.
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:44.860]   But it only shows me two options, like two album options.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:48.260]   So how many albums do you have on Google Photos?
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:49.260]   I'm getting a guess.
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.260]   What?
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:53.180]   Maybe there's something private or something?
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:54.180]   I don't know.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:56.180]   Oh, maybe.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:57.180]   Okay.
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:59.580]   Anyway, this is what I was doing yesterday.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:02.820]   I mean, I have other options.
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:05.260]   So I'm guessing maybe they're set to private or something.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:09.820]   So would you recommend that people spend 50 bucks more for the Lenovo 8-inch or 100
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:12.500]   bucks more for the 10-inch?
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.460]   It depends on the use case.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:19.740]   If you just want a smart hub control where everything is aggregated, all your devices,
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:24.620]   and you get the Google Assistant and occasionally might watch some video or something, no,
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:27.500]   get, spend 150 bucks and get the Google Home app.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:28.500]   It's cheap.
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:34.540]   But if you want to maybe do duo calls, I'm not saying people do, but if you do, and you
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.540]   like it.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.900]   I got my Facebook portal for that.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.900]   Good luck.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:39.980]   Don't call me on that.
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:40.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:47.340]   But if you want to watch YouTube TV or YouTube videos or whatever it is that you want to
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:51.620]   Chromecast to it, I enjoy the experience better on a larger display.
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:56.820]   So for me, it was worth at Costco the extra $50 they get at the 10-inch Lenovo smart display
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:59.940]   because they were selling it for $199.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.780]   I can't figure out how to unorder the Facebook portal.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.780]   That's the language.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.220]   If I could, I would.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.540]   Once you're in, you're in.
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:08.540]   Never.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.540]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.140]   Because I had to reactivate my Facebook account just to order it.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:20.340]   That you know, you know that that was, I hate that anyway.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:21.900]   I blew it.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.140]   I really blew it.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:24.140]   You blew it.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.140]   Liam.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.460]   Well, somebody in the chat and pointed out, you don't have to review this.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:30.260]   No one else is going to buy it.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.820]   Only the media people are going to buy it.
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:32.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:37.540]   And not only that, I bought the $350 10-inch, 15-inch one.
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.340]   That's really silly.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:48.260]   I mean, honestly, even if it was the most amazing camera interface, most seamless, I would still
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:56.580]   be pissed at anyone who recommended it to people because we can no longer evaluate devices
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.540]   without understanding the privacy of the situation.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:14:59.540]   That's a good point.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:00.540]   I think that-
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:01.540]   We're not just reviewing the hardware here.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:06.900]   And I think we need to, in the media, get on that train and stay on it.
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.900]   So that's-
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:12.420]   Michael and Aaron says, "Review it, autograph it, sell it on eBay for charity, but nobody
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:16.580]   won't buy it."
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.180]   I think what I'm going to use it, I'm going to put it in the front door.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.780]   It'll scare people away.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:24.820]   Who, bad guys go, "Oh no, he's got the Facebook portal.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.820]   Get out of here."
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:28.620]   Oh my God, it's linking me right out of my Facebook account.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.620]   Oh no.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:30.620]   I'm going to get-
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.420]   Put it in a room, don't have it go around the house.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:36.100]   Scared the kids at Halloween.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.100]   That's a good idea.
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.740]   I'm going to do that.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:43.980]   Facebook, of course, says, "Hey, good news.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:48.380]   We mentioned maybe as many as 90 million people were hacked.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.660]   We've done an investigation.
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.580]   It's only 30 million people."
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.580]   Good news.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:55.460]   Bad 29 million, something like that.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.460]   Good news.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:06.260]   It's amazing that companies could be so big that this means 30 million Facebook users
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:12.540]   had their account hijacked with this flaw, without their knowledge, and that they could
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.580]   say, "Hey, it's less than we thought.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.020]   It's not so bad."
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:17.020]   30 million.
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:21.700]   They did think it wasn't- didn't they originally think it was 50 million?
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:22.700]   90.
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.100]   Well, there was 50 and then there was another 40 and they thought maybe it could be as
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.820]   many as 90.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.820]   It's only 30.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:28.820]   Good news.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:29.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:38.900]   Yeah, I really- if this thing comes, I'm just slapping a return label on it and sending it
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:39.900]   back.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.980]   I'm sorry, I'm not going to review it.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:41.980]   You're right.
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:43.620]   I was nuts to even think it.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.300]   It's a moment of weakness.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:50.620]   Wait, I can make you stop delivery on a Facebook portal, but I can't make you order a Rodematic?
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:52.740]   I just don't understand you.
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:17:01.860]   No, that's an interesting point because I bought two of these for almost $700.
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.780]   I mean, you do get $100 off when you buy two.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:06.780]   How much is a Rodematic?
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.780]   It's almost-
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:08.780]   $1000.
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:09.780]   Yeah, that's-
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.780]   There's 10% off.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:11.780]   There's 10% off.
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.780]   I could send it to you.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.620]   No, I don't do review units because what if I get hooked on the Rodematic?
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:16.620]   Then I have to send it back.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:17.620]   Then you have to send it back.
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:19.700]   Oh, actually, that's a good point.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.700]   That's what you do.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:29.180]   I bought the Heston Q Bluetooth enabled burner and pots that you recommended.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.340]   I did not recommend those.
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:32.700]   In fact, I told you you shouldn't have bought them.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:33.700]   What?
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:35.700]   Oh, man.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:39.340]   I said, yeah, I just thought that was kind of silly.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.540]   It was Alex Lindsey who said I should buy them.
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:42.540]   Okay.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.540]   Yeah, it was like it was immediately.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:46.500]   I'm so ambivalent about it.
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.380]   They've been sitting in the back of my car.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.620]   I've been driving around with them for a week.
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:51.620]   Unopened.
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:52.620]   Well, you do.
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.420]   Once you've bought it, you should probably at least try it.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.980]   Maybe you'll think differently.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:00.420]   At least this doesn't spy on my eating habits or does it?
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:01.860]   It counts how many wrote it.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.620]   It doesn't spy on yours personally.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:04.620]   Oh, wait.
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:05.620]   I heard the Heston Q.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:07.260]   Well, what is the Rodeist?
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:11.060]   We know the Rodematic spies because it says how many Rodeys have been made.
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:16.340]   Well, yeah, it does know, but it doesn't individually.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:20.580]   It says on its very front page of its website, how many Rodeys have been made by Rodematic?
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:24.140]   Well, it's like a million more than last week.
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:25.140]   It's going up.
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.140]   Go Rodeys.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:29.820]   It was 29 million in something last week.
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:33.620]   Every second another Rodey is made by the Rodematic.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:42.180]   They're 30 million, 24,199 Rodeys have been made by the world's most popular food robot.
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:46.100]   It's a small category.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.100]   It is.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:54.900]   Word number one.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.540]   I don't believe the Heston.
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:01.140]   So it's tracking metrics from the pan for both diagnostic and that sort of thing.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:08.060]   I don't know if it's individually capturing and keeping what you cook.
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:12.260]   It may grab that and anonymize it, but it may not.
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:15.620]   Like the June gives you the option of doing so much.
[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:19.540]   I have to say, Lisa's already frustrated with the June and she says, we're swapping it.
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:23.780]   We're going to bring it to work and swap it back in our old manual toaster oven because
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:24.780]   it's too hard.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:28.580]   She wants to just make toast and it takes three button presses.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.500]   Oh, yeah, they did.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.820]   So they do add the, they say, hey, is it toast?
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:35.820]   You're like, yes.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:41.940]   And then it's like, and then every single time it says, put your rack in the middle.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:46.940]   It's in the middle.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:47.460]   I haven't moved it since I made toast yesterday and every single time.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:51.380]   And then after it's done and plays this little tune, it says, do you want to toast some more
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:53.020]   or do you want to stop now?
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:56.860]   Yeah, but you don't have to actually, it'll stop automatically after time when you pull
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.300]   your toast out and let it shut, it'll leave that up there.
[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:02.060]   And then eventually it's like, oh, I know, but it feels neglected.
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.060]   It's just sitting there.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.060]   It's like asking into space.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.060]   Do you want me to toast some more?
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.060]   I'll toast some more.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.060]   You want me to?
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:08.060]   Anybody?
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.060]   Anybody?
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.580]   So, you just got toasted.
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:14.220]   I know, I know, I know.
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:16.140]   Kevin, Kevin on the, on the board.
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:17.500]   He's running the board.
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.700]   He's Mr. Tuster.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:19.700]   He's good.
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:20.700]   No, he's good.
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.660]   Hackers stole millions of Facebook users.
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:23.900]   A highly sensitive data.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.140]   We mentioned that.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:29.620]   And the FBI has asked it not to say who might behind be behind it.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.980]   I don't, this is Rob Price, writing for Business Insider.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:40.900]   Facebook says the FBI has said, please don't say who is behind this hack.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.900]   What the hell?
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.620]   What does that mean?
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:45.660]   The government told me not to tell you.
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.660]   That's awesome.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:51.020]   We're cooperating with the FBI says Facebook, Facebook executive guy, Rose, Business.
[01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.020]   So is the government.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:55.740]   Yeah, which is actively investigating and has asked us not to discuss who may be behind
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:56.740]   this attack.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.980]   Well, that really raises a question.
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.660]   You know, a question raises for me.
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:03.660]   What?
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:08.300]   Well, if the FBI tells people not to talk about stuff and you can say that, what the
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:12.460]   heck is happening with that Bloomberg story, man?
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:16.700]   I still, I, I'm with Bloomberg.
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:17.700]   I'm with Berg.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.700]   Okay.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:23.940]   We had Mark Millian in from Bloomberg Business Week on Sunday on Twitter and I gave him the
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.260]   fifth, he knows, as Jordan Richardson, he knows Jordan.
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.700]   He worked across the desk from me.
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.460]   He says, very good security reporter.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:35.860]   He says, he knows all the technical details, but this was a general audience article.
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:39.300]   So it's not laden with the technical details, but you could ask him.
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:44.700]   He would tell you, he says this was, they were working on this since the Obama administration
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:49.900]   has been a two year process heavily vetted by management, by their, by their editor in
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:50.900]   chief.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:52.660]   Uh, they really worked on it.
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:56.100]   And I think, you know, he says it's absolutely credible.
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.420]   And I think we're going to see more evidence that it's credible.
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:03.540]   I just, there's no way somebody like Bloomberg Business Week puts this on their cover of
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:10.140]   their magazine unless they're 100% certain Jordan Robertson, I should say.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.740]   And Michael Riley, the authors of this.
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:13.580]   No, I still, I think it's completely credible.
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:18.540]   And again, as we said last week, the, the issue isn't from a, from our point of view,
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:21.340]   well, who did what when, but that this happens all the time.
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:22.340]   We know it happens.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.340]   We do it.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.340]   They do it.
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:25.340]   It happens in the supply chain.
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:33.260]   You know, shipping and it's very hard to fix because we don't, we don't want to make
[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:36.060]   stuff in the United States anymore.
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.060]   Yep.
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.060]   Okay.
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.060]   Where are we?
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.060]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.060]   Amazon unveils.
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:44.660]   This is a little, we're going to throw you a little IOT bone here.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.660]   Ooh.
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:51.300]   Amazon unveils three new APIs that send camera data.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:59.380]   Uh, from smart cameras and doorbells to Echo devices makes it easier for Amazon developers
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.340]   to tap into connected security cameras and doorbells.
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:11.100]   It's the doorbell event source API, the motion sensor API and the Alexa RTC session controller.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:17.200]   And it doesn't have to be an echo, I mean, an Amazon bit of hardware, third party smart
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.200]   home apps.
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.140]   Uh, no, this is, yeah, we have been waiting for this for a while.
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:25.180]   Like even ring after they were bought by Amazon were still waiting.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:27.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:29.180]   So well, it would be just for rings or will it be for everything?
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.060]   Um, if it's an API, right?
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.580]   Anybody can use it.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:35.900]   Now the question is who's going to actually build for it?
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:40.900]   So the biggest, like August actually built something custom that's a little bit different
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.900]   to put their stuff in.
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:46.060]   Amazon says both ring and August support doorbell event source and motion sensor.
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:49.740]   So August, which is not an Amazon device does already.
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:50.740]   Right.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:51.740]   So it's supported.
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:56.260]   I've been able to look at my Arlo's on my Arlo cameras by net gear on my echo for a
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:57.260]   while.
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:59.500]   So they're either using it or they're going to port to using this.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.100]   So what does this mean for end users?
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.340]   What give me an use case?
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:09.380]   If someone wants to, if a company wants to implement this, you'll be able to see your
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:15.460]   camera feeds on your echo show or your echo spot or is there another device with a camera
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:16.460]   with a screen?
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:19.620]   Um, no, maybe I, or your TV.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:22.420]   Because there are a lot of echo enabled TVs now, right?
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:26.100]   So I don't know if it, I assume it would work on the fire.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:31.340]   We have, you know, this hundred inch high sense TV is echo enabled.
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.340]   I would love it if it would just display it.
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:34.340]   Is it my front door?
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:35.340]   Who's at my side?
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.940]   You know, that would be awesome.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:43.860]   The downside is if you choose not to use it like nest, nest does not make any of their
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.820]   camera APIs available to third parties.
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:48.900]   You're not going to, your nest gear won't work.
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:51.860]   So your Dropbox and stuff won't show up there.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:55.380]   The other thing is there's a lot of latency.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.540]   So it's not great for doorbells or security cameras.
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:00.260]   Because by the time you see the picture, they've already left.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.260]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.020]   It's taken about five seconds.
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.860]   Where you're like, show me this.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:10.100]   It's a long time when you're like, oh, the doorbell's just rang.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.300]   So, so does this enable two way communication as well?
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.980]   I think like it should.
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:19.660]   You know, my stuff had two way communication on it.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:27.540]   So I'm guessing like I could shout through my camera with two way audio on it through
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.540]   the echo, I believe.
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:30.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:34.380]   I'm thinking you'll be able to, even if you can't see who's at the door, you could speak
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:38.580]   to your echo and say who's there or I'll be right there or whatnot.
[01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:43.660]   So you still have to establish the connection and that's what takes time.
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:50.620]   Although, although, although, although, I don't know.
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.660]   Do you have a nest hello doorbell Leo?
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:56.660]   I have a ring doorbell because rings the sponsor.
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:57.660]   Sorry.
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:58.820]   Thank you for playing.
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.860]   But the nest, the nest.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.980]   That works with the Google Home Hub, right?
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:07.460]   It does, but it gets better.
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:11.940]   It also works with this on the Pixel stand and what's the latency on that?
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.620]   Do you have you noticed?
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:18.820]   I tested it because I have an Nvidia TV, Nvidia Shield TV box up here, which is an Android
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:19.820]   TV.
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:20.820]   Yes, do I.
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:24.220]   And I have my doorbell pop up on there and takes about five seconds just like we were
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.820]   saying with the other products.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:29.780]   It was about, we tested it yesterday morning at five thirty in the morning because my wife
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:31.780]   was going to walk the dog.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:36.700]   She hit the doorbell and it showed up here in about one second on my phone, but it has
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:39.980]   to be in the stand.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:47.580]   So I have a shield, but I don't have the doorbell, but I do have some nest cameras around the
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.580]   house.
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:49.580]   Well, those you can see those.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.140]   I have the outdoor nest cameras.
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:57.700]   Actually was really handy when that woman drove over our mailbox while we were on our
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:02.340]   last vacation.
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:05.900]   We were in Japan and I'm looking and I said, what happened to our mailbox because we have
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:07.860]   one of those real things.
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:09.940]   And it was.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.580]   So I scanned back through the video and I could see this woman and it turned out to be the
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.420]   newspaper delivery lady who's driving her car.
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:21.220]   She's folding newspapers and there's watching her car just kind of veer off the road, slaughter
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.700]   our mailbox, if you're back.
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:27.700]   That's one of the things people don't think about with these cameras.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.300]   I mean, it's great to see who's coming to the door and everything, but there's lots
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:31.300]   of stuff I look at.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.420]   Yeah, like six months ago, we park our car on the street here.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.100]   We're in a townhouse community.
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:38.940]   My wife went out to the car at 6 a.m.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.900]   And there were pieces all over and a big dent in her car.
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:42.900]   What happened?
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:45.420]   So I went back to the nest that's facing front.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:50.100]   And sure enough, the night before people from across the street hit it, I had all the footage.
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:51.340]   They claimed not to have hit it.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:55.700]   And I'm like, there you are pulling out of the driveway hitting my car.
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:59.220]   So their insurance company paid for everything, including our deductible because I had the
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:00.500]   video.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:05.220]   In this case, at first I was perturbed until I looked at my ring doorbell and I had the
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:09.220]   video of her immediately after coming knocking on her door, coming back three hours later
[01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:13.780]   knocking on her door, coming back three hours after that, she felt terrible.
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:18.380]   And I called her, she left a message, like a 30 minute message, which I didn't hear because
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.100]   I was in Japan.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:22.900]   But when I got it, I called her back and said, don't worry about it.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.100]   Thank you for being so honest.
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.100]   It's fine.
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.660]   We didn't like that mailbox anyway.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:29.060]   You're very nice.
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:32.860]   Oh, well, for crying out loud, she delivered a newspaper.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:35.940]   She probably doesn't have a lot of money to make mailboxes right.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:36.940]   Right.
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:37.940]   Well, that's true.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:41.140]   I wonder if I saved it as a clip.
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:43.380]   I wonder where that would.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.900]   I could show you.
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:45.900]   No, no, no, no.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.900]   Don't get that to her.
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.460]   That's not cool.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:53.500]   Who needs Facebook portal for privacy?
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:56.100]   We've got Leo's camera there.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.580]   Yeah, come on.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:58.980]   Don't you want to see it?
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:28:59.980]   The chat room's going.
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:00.980]   Yes, show it.
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:01.980]   Show it.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.860]   All right, I want you to go.
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.020]   I mean, that was a really bad moment in her life.
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.020]   It was.
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:09.660]   And I felt really good when I called her up and said, oh, that's honey.
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:10.660]   That's fine.
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:11.660]   Don't worry about it.
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:12.660]   It's an older woman.
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:15.740]   And I said, just next time, try to stay on the road.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:19.100]   OK, I don't want you to get hurt.
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.340]   Yeah, no, I appreciate.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:24.580]   I both appreciate and kind of sad about it.
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:25.580]   You know, like.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:30.180]   Yeah, it's kind of, I know, because now everything's on camera.
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:37.460]   And in little things, like, you know, it's kind of fun to like, you know, see like the
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:40.580]   kids getting their Halloween candy on your camera.
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:45.940]   But it's also like, oh, kids can't go ring people's doorbells and run away anymore.
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:47.060]   I guess that's not great.
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:49.340]   But like remember when you toilet people's houses?
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:53.940]   Yeah, no, they can't do no, no, no, dong and dash or whatever they call it.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.660]   Here's you could see this.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:57.740]   You can't identify her.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:00.420]   Here's the mailbox over here on the right.
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:05.860]   OK, and let me let me speed it up a little bit.
[01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:07.140]   Here comes her car.
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.420]   See, there it is.
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:09.420]   She's driving.
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:10.420]   She's driving.
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:12.060]   She's delivering the newspapers.
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.700]   Now she's folding the newspaper.
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:16.140]   It's actually kind of kind of fun to have this.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:19.260]   It's not so good that I posted it on Reddit or anything.
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.260]   But watch out.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.260]   There's a mailbox.
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:22.260]   Oh crap.
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:23.260]   Whoops.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:30.700]   OK, anyway, it's not as exciting as I remember it.
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.700]   It works.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.980]   Well, it's really exciting when you're like, ah ha!
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   I got it!
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:36.980]   What happened?
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:37.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:38.980]   No, I was puzzling.
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:40.980]   Like, why is my mailbox lying on the ground?
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:42.500]   It's funny because I never had cameras.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:43.500]   I never wanted cameras.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:49.180]   In fact, I was always of the opinion that that kind of paranoia and lack of trust leads
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.860]   to people doing bad things to you.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:54.900]   Like if you trust, you leave your door unlocked, everything's going to be fine.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:55.900]   And it's always been that way.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:58.460]   But we had to test these out and try them and stuff.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:30:59.460]   So I put them around.
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.020]   I have all the different cameras and stuff.
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:03.020]   And it's kind of cool.
[01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:04.620]   I have one in my office.
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:07.340]   Our 15-year-old goes around throughout the house for a while.
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:12.340]   I've had three or four in the house and unplugs them or knocks them over or puts them under
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:13.820]   furniture.
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:15.260]   He doesn't want any video.
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:16.260]   No video.
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.220]   So I honor his.
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:19.860]   I honor that too.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.220]   I thought you were going to show the video of her knocking on your door.
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:23.900]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:24.900]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:25.900]   Identifiable.
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:26.900]   Okay, that's what I was like.
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:27.900]   I was like, how was my mailbox?
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:28.900]   Just a car hitting my mailbox.
[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:32.340]   I'm not even really, you know, just kind of sight, sight-swiping.
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:35.620]   I think we should blow some trumpets because it's time for you ready for this.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:39.340]   Kevin the Google change log.
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:48.500]   The Google change log.
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:55.540]   Having helping parents have the tech talk with their kids, Google has decided that it's
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:59.740]   time for them to help parents teach their kids.
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:04.580]   It's part of October's National Cyber Security Awareness and National Bullying Prevention
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:05.580]   Month.
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:11.460]   Kevin, we're partnering with the national PTA and donors, Choose.org.
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:15.100]   Two initiatives to help kids be safe and positive online.
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:20.620]   Our goal this year says Google is to reach 5 million kids with B Internet Awesome.
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.340]   It's a bilingual kit in English and Spanish.
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:24.140]   It includes a pixel book.
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:25.780]   Wait a minute.
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:27.900]   How do I sign up for this?
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.180]   To power the workshop, a presentation.
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:35.100]   Oh, I see you give a workshop and you get the pixel book, but then I guess you probably
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:38.660]   have to send a pack of presentation, developed in partnership with the Family Online Safety
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:39.820]   Institute.
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.060]   They talk about online safety, digital citizenship.
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:45.820]   This is great tips and resources to create a positive digital experience.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:48.460]   Family guys to inspire co-learning at home.
[01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:52.460]   Posters for the school to remind students to be Internet Awesome.
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:33:00.700]   By being kids, this is the new Boy Scouts smart, alert, strong, kind and brave.
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:07.020]   And a school banner is a recognition for participating in Be Internet Awesome.
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:10.820]   If you're interested in applying for one of the 200 workshop grants or a kit, visit the
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:13.660]   National PTA site, PTA.org.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:17.180]   It's in their programs section.
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:21.380]   Later this fall says Google, we're making content from the kit available digitally for
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:27.620]   everybody on our Be Internet Awesome with Google.com website.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:35.100]   It's kind of along your LB, Internet Awesome.com with Google.com.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:39.100]   Play your way.
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.100]   The Crime Dog.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:42.300]   And they get...
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:45.740]   Take a bite out of bullying.
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:48.660]   Help Be Internet Awesome.
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:52.140]   This is McGruff the Crime Dog, seeing.
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:56.860]   See you later.
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:01.300]   Going behind the design of the new Chromecast, people have been now reviewing the Chromecast.
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:05.100]   As you pointed out last week, it's only 1080p, but it is 60 frames a second.
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:06.980]   It's not a massive improvement.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:10.180]   Most of the people reviewing it say, you don't need the new Chromecast if you've got the old
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:11.500]   Chromecast.
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:14.940]   If you have a 4K, you're going to get the Chromecast Ultra anyway.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:21.300]   But here is a conversation about details about the new Chromecast.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:22.300]   You know what?
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:27.460]   Here's a typical exchange between the Google interviewer and the Google employee.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:32.580]   So what sets Chromecast and made by Google products apart from other devices?
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.300]   It's the design language.
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.540]   This is the reason I wanted to join Google.
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:41.140]   We're making tech that's approachable, human-centric, and easily blends in with other things in
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:45.340]   your house.
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:48.340]   Everything to know about the Google Assistant on our new family of hardware.
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:52.260]   This is a post on the keyword by Manuel Bronstein.
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:55.820]   He's the Vice President of Product for Google Assistant.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:35:02.260]   It's kind of an all-on-one page listing of things you can do with assistant-like screen
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:08.500]   calls, block spam, book reservations, new accessories, how to manage them.
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.500]   Worth reading.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.020]   You know, not that long.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:16.300]   It's shorter than that tweet storm.
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:20.580]   But it'll give you some, maybe some insight if you've got one of these.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:22.340]   Here's something Jeff would be happy.
[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:29.700]   Google Plus in G Suite gets content tagging, custom streams, and more engagement and metrics.
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:33.260]   I think the Google Plus team is like that Japanese soldier who didn't know the war was
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:37.100]   over but was living at Okinawa for years.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.300]   They're not truly shutting Google Plus down.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:42.420]   They're shooting, turning the consumer version off.
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:45.140]   So there is going to be a business for enterprise.
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:46.140]   Yes, for business.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.140]   All right.
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.140]   And Jeff has G Suite.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:52.420]   It'd be the one thing Jeff has that I can't sign in with it exactly.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:57.460]   Actually, so is this, do they see this as an intranet thing?
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.380]   We used it at Google all the time.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.380]   Yeah, they use it internally.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:04.580]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:09.180]   So sometimes it would sometimes would be for product information updates, secret projects
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:12.740]   that aren't so secret anymore or just communities.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:15.420]   They had some great communities at Google.
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:19.740]   So you can have a private Google Plus for your business.
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:21.740]   Well, Google does.
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:25.300]   I don't know if we can, but well, that's the question, right?
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:26.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:31.220]   It probably isn't private because I think you can invite people from outside.
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.620]   I don't know.
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:33.620]   I don't know.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.620]   Here's the deal.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.820]   But it's not completely going away.
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:41.660]   The final sentence, even though Google Plus for consumers, look how they spell consumers.
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:45.020]   It's kind of the modern spelling no e is being ditched.
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:48.900]   It's very much alive and kicking in the enterprise.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:54.140]   So there, and you thought Google Plus was dead.
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.140]   Google Cloud.
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.140]   Like Slack.
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:57.780]   Yeah, I don't know what it is.
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:59.140]   No one knows.
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:04.820]   And by the way, what business is going to invest anytime at all in Google Plus knowing
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:12.660]   that at any moment it could follow its consumer version down the dustbin of history, right?
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:18.300]   Yeah, nobody's going to nobody's nobody's new is going to adopt it.
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:19.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:21.300]   Google Slack.
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:30.140]   Google Cloud adds cloud identity cloud IAP and secure LDAP.
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:31.140]   Next item.
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:35.300]   No, that's enterprise people out there.
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.860]   They're happy now.
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:37.860]   That's okay.
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:38.860]   You got the other button?
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:39.860]   The Google got LDAP.
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:42.580]   I got LDAP for you.
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:43.580]   It's LDAP.
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:44.940]   It's here.
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.580]   That's the Google change log.
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:54.900]   And we are going to take a little break and come back with your picks of the week this
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:57.340]   week in Google brought to you today by Capt.

[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.500]  com/twig.
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.980]   C-A-P-T-E-R-A.
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:06.980]   Capt.
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:07.980]   Tara.
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:08.980]  com/twig.
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:14.420]   You use Capt. Tara every month to find the right tool for the job.
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:20.660]   Kevin Tofel, thank you for recommending the white album 50th Anniversary Edition.
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:21.740]   Did you order?
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:22.740]   I did immediately.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.220]   Very good.
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:26.660]   November 4th.
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:27.660]   That sounds about right.
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:28.660]   Something like that.
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:29.660]   Couple weeks.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:32.340]   Yeah, I'm so excited.
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:34.260]   You know what I heard today for the first time?
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.260]   What?
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:36.260]   November 9th.
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:37.260]   Sorry.
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:38.820]   I'm serious XM.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:43.420]   The only reason I subscribe is serious XM is because they have a dedicated Beatles channel.
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:48.420]   And as I was coming home from class just before the show, they were doing a tour of Abbey
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:53.340]   Road Studio and they played the very first recording the Beatles ever made there, which
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:55.420]   was their audition.
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:57.620]   And it was the let it be.
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:58.620]   No.
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.620]   Bonnie.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.620]   Bonnie.
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.620]   No, no, no.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:02.620]   Oh, come on.
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.700]   Now I can't remember.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:08.660]   This is to get it was capital to sign them.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:09.660]   Love me do.
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:10.660]   Sorry.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:11.660]   Love me do.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:12.660]   That was their first hit.
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:13.660]   I was actually hit, right?
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:14.660]   It was.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.540]   That's what got George Martin to sign them, but they played the audition tape.
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:18.540]   Is it different?
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:19.540]   Yes.
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:21.500]   Yes, it's different.
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:25.740]   It's not tremendously different, but most of these, you know, re-recording and all aren't
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:26.740]   very different.
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:32.060]   But it was very interesting to hear the very first Abbey Road recording of a Beatles song.
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:33.060]   Wow.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.060]   Yeah.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:36.500]   Not that anybody cares, but you can get that.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.500]   How can I get that?
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:41.580]   Tune into serious.com/twit.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:43.100]   I don't know.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:45.300]   I don't have serious.
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:50.740]   They sell an internet only package so you can stream it.
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:52.700]   I'm almost positive they do.
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:53.700]   They have to.
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:57.020]   I mean, they can't just rely on satellite when the internet is kind of everywhere.
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:03.580]   Twenty-seven early acoustic demos, 50 session takes, and the original album's 30 tracks
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:07.340]   newly mixed by Giles Martin, George Martin's son.
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:11.140]   He did the Sergeant Pepper remix too, right?
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:12.140]   He did.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.020]   He worked for this on the whole love show.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:16.500]   That love show is so good.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.300]   How many times have you seen that?
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.300]   A dozen.
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:23.980]   Every time I go, I keep trying to get Stacy to come with me.
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:24.980]   What?
[01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:25.980]   Yes.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:26.980]   She won't go.
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:31.180]   The last time I just had other, I wanted to sleep.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:32.740]   I'm so I'm so late.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:33.740]   Other commitments.
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:36.060]   Your beetle commitment is terrible.
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:37.060]   You wanted to sleep.
[01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:39.700]   I am not good.
[01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:40.700]   Not good.
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:42.940]   It's such a fun show, even if you don't want the beetles.
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:45.780]   But if you like the beetles, it's like heaven.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:46.780]   No.
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:47.780]   Heaven.
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:48.780]   Listen, we'll go this year.
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:49.780]   Sure, sure, sure.
[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:50.780]   Sure, sure.
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:51.780]   Okay.
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:53.380]   What do you got for us, Kevin?
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:58.460]   Well, I don't want to do what I have for you because I didn't know it's kind of like
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.820]   something that one of your sponsors actually does.
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:01.820]   No, I don't care.
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:02.820]   No, no, no, no, no, please.
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.820]   I do.
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:09.340]   Editorial independence, as you know, think of me as Om Malek is very important.
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:11.980]   I mean, I did upload that picture of the Hulk behind me.
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:12.980]   We want to show that for my thing.
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:13.980]   I'm fine with that.
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:15.540]   I put it on the show notes.
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:16.540]   Okay.
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:19.020]   We'll show Kevin's picture of the Hulk.
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.860]   This is, we were playing before the show.
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:24.180]   I am really stoked by these AR things.
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.180]   There's Kevin.
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:29.460]   And the Hulk apparently reacts to expressions.
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:30.700]   So he does different things.
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:31.700]   All of them do.
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:33.300]   But come on, give us your pick.
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:37.660]   I don't want anybody ever feel like they can't pick something because it competes with a
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:38.660]   sponsor.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:39.660]   That's ridiculous.
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:40.660]   All right.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:44.300]   Well, so this is actually sort of old news because it was announced in March, but it
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:48.420]   just was kind of reannounced on the Google Cloud blog.
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:52.620]   And this is the VPN service called outline.
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:56.660]   Yes, this was a tangent originally for journalists.
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:57.660]   Exactly.
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:00.340]   But you can certainly use it yourself.
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:03.620]   And when I found really interesting about it, you can put it on your own server.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:05.060]   Okay, that's no big deal.
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:09.020]   But you could actually have it hosted in the cloud through a number of host providers.
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.580]   Including our sponsor, DigitalOcean.
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.580]   There you go.
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:13.580]   See, there's always.
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:15.500]   There's always a sponsor connection.
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:19.220]   Yeah, but he looked to me and I haven't set it up yet, but it looked to me like you can
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:23.300]   actually have specific controls around different devices in your house.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:27.460]   And that's important to me because if I VPN everything, then I lose my YouTube TV, my
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:28.460]   Netflix, everything else.
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:32.660]   So I'm wondering, hmm, maybe on like a Google display, could I not have it connected to
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:34.380]   the VPN for those services?
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:35.540]   So I'm going to play with that.
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:39.860]   And I just thought to mention it because it might be interesting to some of the viewers
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:42.220]   who maybe are journalists or not journalists.
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:43.220]   I don't know.
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:47.900]   Most VPNs use OpenVPN, but this is Google's own open source.
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:52.460]   And I might point out independently audited VPN platform.
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.460]   Yes.
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:54.460]   So you know what?
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:57.660]   This doesn't really compete because it's kind of roll your own.
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.660]   Correct.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:03.500]   So, you know, and if people just want to turn key VPN, they're not going to go to this.
[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:09.740]   But if you're interested, you know, even in maybe you want complete security and run.
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:13.060]   One of the problems with the VPN is you have to trust the VPN provider while you could
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:15.540]   run it yourself off your own server.
[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:16.540]   Yep.
[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:19.140]   Then how safe would you feel?
[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:20.140]   Cool.
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:21.140]   Right.
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:24.980]   Pretty safe until I put a Facebook portal in my house.
[01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:25.980]   And then you're done.
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:26.980]   I can't wait.
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:27.980]   Yep.
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:28.980]   First thing I'm doing is calling you tellful.
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:29.980]   I give it.
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:31.860]   Guess what I'm on.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:32.860]   Don't pick it up.
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:33.860]   Don't.
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:38.220]   Guess what I'm talking to you on Facebook.
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:40.220]   It's 15 inches.
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:43.860]   It's the only way the only way I would take a call from you is if we like played some
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:46.620]   vinyl over the internet to each other with that.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.620]   That I can do.
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:48.620]   Beatles music.
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:51.100]   Because everyone already knows you know you love the Beatles.
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:54.060]   I already see what if you had bootleg content?
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:56.700]   What if it was a second?
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:57.700]   Where'd that come from?
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:59.260]   Everybody has bootleg content.
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:00.660]   Why do you think I need a VPN?
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:02.540]   That's right.
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:03.540]   That's right.
[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:04.820]   He's been sneaking into Abbey Road late at night.
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:05.820]   What do you have for us?
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:07.220]   Stacy, it can buff them.
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:10.660]   So I do not have anything that I've actually tried.
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:11.660]   So I'm so sorry.
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:12.940]   I've been on the road.
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:14.420]   The world is a horrible place.
[01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:17.540]   But I did see this and I thought it was interesting.
[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:18.860]   It is let's see.
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:19.980]   It's called Helm.
[01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:21.820]   It is a startup that gives you.
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:23.060]   Oh, I saw this.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:24.060]   Yes.
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:30.740]   So it's basically a storage drive and a pre-configured email server that you buy and you put in your
[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.260]   home.
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:36.980]   It's unclear to me if like it's a like it's a $500 device.
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:40.300]   But it looks like there might be other subscriptions related to it.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:41.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:43.460]   So it's $100 after the first year.
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:48.980]   I read about this on Hacker News and actually the Hacker.
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:53.260]   One of the really great things about Hacker News and why Combinator is that you've got
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:57.540]   smart people reading it and commenting on it.
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:06.940]   So the media reaction from people was, how could this possibly work?
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:14.820]   And most importantly, most internet service providers block outbound email.
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:19.580]   And furthermore, if you do it yourself, there's no guarantee you won't be blocked because
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:22.500]   most IP addresses are reused and most of them have dings.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:24.620]   You need a clean IP address.
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:31.100]   So the Helm, one of the Helm creators got on to answer those questions.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:34.380]   So some really useful stuff.
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:36.740]   CEO and co-founder of Helm.
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:40.060]   This reference IP addresses we assigned to gateways against known blacklists that keeps
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.740]   you out of the black holes.
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:47.260]   They fully support DMARC, DKIM, and SPF, which is really important email authentication.
[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:50.020]   They configure reverse DNS as well.
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:55.820]   This is for somebody who says, you know, I don't trust provider XYZ, whether it's Google
[01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:58.900]   or Yahoo or Outlook to store my mail.
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:02.380]   I want to store my mail myself.
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:07.460]   They run the, your stuff will get run through Amazon's S3, but it doesn't get stored on
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:08.940]   S3.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:09.940]   It's really interesting.
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:15.500]   Amazon doesn't look into individual customers' S3 instances.
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:20.580]   Yeah, but still, if you, you know, if you say, well, I don't, you know, I use fast mail
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.300]   for instance, I don't use Google for my mail.
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:23.780]   I use fast mail.
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:25.180]   And I'm trusting fast mail.
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:29.020]   But if you don't trust somebody, anybody, you're not, you know, Amazon's insurance is
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.020]   not going to.
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:33.980]   Yeah, we're rapidly leaving that world where you could have your, you could be totally
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:34.980]   self-sufficient.
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:35.980]   I don't think that that's the case.
[01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:39.420]   But if you have always wanted to run a mail server, this would be a lot easier.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:40.900]   Probably running a mail server.
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:41.900]   Then running post-fix.
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:42.900]   No.
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:43.900]   Yeah.
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:44.900]   So it's an interesting idea.
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:46.900]   I'm glad you brought it up actually.
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:50.700]   Vhelm.com.
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.940]   But this is not for this is if you think outline is hard to set up.
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:48:00.700]   Not for the faint of heart, but you can run your own personal email server.
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:04.860]   I mean, honestly, that if you really care about this kind of stuff, you probably want
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:05.860]   to get a business.
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:06.860]   You probably do it on your own.
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:12.920]   And you have to have a business class ISP because all I, all commercial, consumer ISP is block
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:13.920]   port 25.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.740]   And you know, they're not going to let you do because of spammers.
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:19.300]   They're just basically not going to let you send out email.
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:22.860]   Plus, you know, you get black hold because, but this sounds like a good way to get around
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:23.860]   all of that stuff.
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:24.860]   So that's interesting.
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:27.860]   So I'm going to mention it.
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:28.860]   The helm.com.
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:34.340]   And it's kind of a cute looking box.
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:36.340]   Wouldn't mind having that in my house.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:37.340]   It is a cute looking box.
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:38.340]   Yeah.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:39.340]   I'm, you know, 500 bucks.
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:43.540]   Kind of expensive.
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:45.380]   Why easier than setting up an exchange server?
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:47.180]   I'll tell you that right now.
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:48.180]   Yeah.
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:49.180]   Yuck.
[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:50.180]   Ew.
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:54.780]   Um, Stacy, always a pleasure.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:56.780]   I got to pick Stacy on IOT.com.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:58.340]   Get on over there.
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:48:59.860]   Sign up for the email.
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:01.940]   You get on our mailing lists.
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:04.060]   Listen to the podcast she does with Kevin.
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:05.060]   You recorded this morning.
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:06.220]   I take it.
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:07.220]   We did.
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:09.140]   And you know, this week we did not do the same show.
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:10.140]   What did you do?
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:11.140]   So exciting.
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.580]   What do you mean you didn't do the same show?
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:16.780]   Some weeks the news that we cover is like IOT focused.
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:21.660]   So I feel like we do the show and then we come here and we do it again.
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:23.420]   Oh, this show, you mean?
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:24.420]   Yes.
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:25.420]   No.
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:28.420]   In fact, you talk about a lot of stuff, including the Facebook portal.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:33.900]   But opinions have not changed.
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:37.380]   Many, but what you didn't know is Leo bought one.
[01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:38.780]   That's what you didn't know.
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:41.780]   And then don't forget to get the IOT newsletter.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:45.860]   Kevin Tofel has a great site for people who are interested in Chromebooks.
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:49.780]   What has, do we have any idea when the slate is coming?
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:55.100]   So short of a Best Buy listing that had a release date of November 22nd that has now
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:56.100]   been pulled.
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.100]   Right.
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:58.100]   We don't.
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:49:59.100]   Yeah.
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:00.100]   Oh, so it won't be on Thanksgiving Day.
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:01.100]   Yeah.
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:02.100]   Might be the day after.
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:03.100]   Black Friday.
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:04.100]   Yeah.
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.100]   Cause does Best Buy open some co-op and come on?
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:06.100]   Oh, they do.
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.100]   They open at night on Thanksgiving Day.
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.060]   Maybe that makes sense.
[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:10.740]   That might be a Black Friday deal.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:11.740]   Could be.
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:12.900]   Could be.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:16.580]   That means I'm going to skip Thanksgiving dinner then because I'm getting me a Pixel
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:17.580]   Slate.
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:18.580]   Okay.
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:22.380]   And apparently the Chromebooks spin 13 is live.
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:24.740]   Now I have the Chromebooks spin 15.
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:26.220]   That thing is a monster.
[01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:27.220]   It's a beast.
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:28.220]   It's awesome.
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:33.540]   It's a Chromebook like you never saw before.
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:35.460]   It's a tank.
[01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:40.740]   This is all from Kevin's great site about Chromebooks.com.
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:43.920]   Chromebooks, Chrome OS and Chrome tablet news.
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:45.580]   Thank you, Kevin, for being here.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:46.580]   Thank you.
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:47.580]   My pleasure.
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:48.580]   You too, Stacey.
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:49.860]   I appreciate it.
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:54.820]   We do this week in Google with these great people.
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.700]   Such great people.
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:03.500]   You know, superlatives have lost their oomph ever since President Trump has gotten into
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:07.980]   office because saying somebody's great is just like normal now.
[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:10.420]   So I need a new word.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:12.580]   Spectacular.
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:14.140]   I have this problem too.
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:17.540]   On the show when we're doing our show, I'm constantly, we have an awesome band.
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:18.540]   Some show.
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:23.220]   Yeah, you can't say that anymore because it's like, no, it's devalued all superlatives.
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:24.220]   We have a show.
[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:25.220]   That's what we say.
[01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:26.220]   It's a show.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:27.220]   We have a show.
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:28.220]   It's a show.
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:29.220]   It's not great.
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:30.220]   It's just a show.
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:31.220]   It's not great.
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:32.220]   It's not great.
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:33.220]   It's just a show.
[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:40.500]   And we do this show every Wednesday afternoon, once a week at 1.30 p.m. Pacific 430 Eastern
[01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:41.500]   2030 UTC.
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:47.500]   Actually, a couple of weeks, we're going to have to fall back.
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.500]   We'll be at 21.30 UTC.
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.500]   No, we'll be at 19.30.
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:53.500]   I don't know.
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.900]   We'll have to do the math.
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:56.900]   Right now though.
[01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:57.900]   There's an app for that.
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:51:58.900]   Yeah.
[01:51:58.900 --> 01:51:59.900]   It's still 20.30 UTC.
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:01.540]   You do the math.
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:05.300]   If you know what, if you get confused and you can't watch it live at twit.tv/live or
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:06.420]   join the chatroom at IRC.
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:07.420]   That's twit.tv.
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:13.620]   You can always get it on to man at your convenience anytime of the day or night by going to twit.tv/twig
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:19.380]   or even better subscribing in your favorite podcast application.
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.340]   If you subscribe, you get it automatically.
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:22.740]   You don't have to go out and get it.
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:26.780]   It pushes itself into your life.
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:27.980]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:31.580]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:32.580]   Bye bye.
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:33.820]   Stop messing with the clocks.
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:40.820]   [music]
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:43.320]   (light music)
