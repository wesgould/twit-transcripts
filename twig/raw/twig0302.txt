[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   He's here!
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Oh, that means it must be Google I/O time.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I've been headquarters.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Hey!
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Well, how like, good to be here.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And then you pair Jeff Jarvis with somebody like Kevin Marks and his, and his birds.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Kevin just reached behind him and got an orange off that orange tree.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I hate it.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   It's amazing.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's great.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Let's see, open it up.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's nice.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Oh, man.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Is it, was it, are they edible?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Well, oranges, yeah.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I heard that tomatoes are poison.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I just want to warn you.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Also, you're only myself.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I'll bring the cotton.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I love the cat.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   He was here last week.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   That's great.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.500]   Also here for the first time, although he's been on all about Android many times, from
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.000]   ours technical, one of my favorite tech blogs, Mr. Ron Amadio.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Hey!
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   See you, Ron.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Awesome to be here.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I'm thrilled to meet you.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   This is really cool.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Big fan reads you religiously.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We quote you all the time.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.720]   And we kind of, I try as a policy to always say, from ours technique, Ron Amadio ready,
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.000]   although I mispronounced it all along.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I kept calling you Ron, "Trapani."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So, Ron Amadio, I got it now.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.720]   And you cover Android.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.000]   What's your beat?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Android, Google stuff.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   You wrote a great piece on what to expect.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Yes.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah, very, very long.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I always try to, I always try to go as in-depth as possible.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Well, we talked about it on Sunday.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.240]   And I always feel like you kind of know, you have like some, you have sources, right?
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.240]   You're not making this stuff.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   No.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   No.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.240]   Kind of sometimes.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   I do not.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.080]   No, most of the time it is just research.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.160]   So is Android Am really going to be marshmallow?
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.240]   No, no, no, we're just messing around with that.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.880]   I just wanted to, I was bored writing this.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.880]   This is me procrastinating.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.880]   That's what we need to encourage.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.280]   When you see, okay, this is good to know.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.040]   I want a tech blog when you see a big image with Photoshop text.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.920]   Yeah, that's the guy who doesn't want to write.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   Right.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   I was just, oh, this is bored.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.720]   I could take this craft marshmallow bag and turn it in.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   What's the font?
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   You actually did it beautifully.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   That's good.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.640]   And yes, too many people steal my pictures.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   You're a Photoshop, isn't it?
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.680]   You have to hide something in there.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.680]   You are a Photoshop.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.120]   You got the, you got the, you got the, it bent with the, yeah.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.120]   Yeah, yeah, it's nice.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120]   It's nice.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.120]   I'm readily impressed.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.600]   That's like, there's tech writing stuff.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   So going to the design.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.360]   Hey, before we talk about Google I/O, that's what you and Jeff are here for.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.080]   You're not going to IO, right, Kevin?
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   I may be.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.960]   I have to go to the ticket, but I make it a sneaky pass.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   It starts tomorrow.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   Working on it.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.960]   Okay.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   Down to the wire.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.960]   Kevin, Kevin got himself a Google uniform so he can go down.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.480]   Well, no, it'll be, I'll be wearing somebody else's badge, but then I have been known to
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.480]   wear yours in the past.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.640]   Shh, shh, shh, ex-nay on the edge, Barry.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   They like it.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   Accent.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   You want to sound American?
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   Of course.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.160]   They livestream so much of this stuff though.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.400]   I don't know if it's worth going over it.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.640]   In fact, we're going to cover it.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.440]   So I'll be in here early for Mike Gugga.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.760]   Mike and Jason are going, right, Jason Howell.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   That's right.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   That's right.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.280]   So neither of them are going to be here tomorrow, but Mike will, I will be filling in for Mike
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.560]   with TNT at 8.30 a.m. and then after, shortly after TNT, we'll go to our live coverage of
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.820]   Google I/O and we'll, and we do what we always do.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.160]   We'll stream the keynote live and then Gina and I, Gina Trapani is going to join me and
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.960]   I and Ron Richards and Aaron Nukem will comment.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   Right.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.760]   Two and a half hours.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.760]   Make sure you go to the potty beforehand.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   Get ready.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.760]   I'm exhausted just thinking about it.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.040]   And if Larry comes out, it'll be three.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   I hope Larry comes out.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   That was cool.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.040]   It was like three years, two or three years ago.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.200]   He came out and answered questions and talked about Google Island.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.380]   And he'll never be allowed to speak.
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.140]   The PR people said never let Larry onstage again.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.140]   No, he's in charge.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.580]   He can do whatever he wants.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.380]   I, yeah, but I feel like that there's got to be PR people who are saying, you know, Larry.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.380]   We would really prefer it.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.380]   But the PR just left.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.260]   So, oh, that's not good.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.260]   That's right.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.020]   Little said, I just went to Uber.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.620]   Oh, what a bad hit of Joe.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.620]   So they may be able to do it.
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.620]   Well, they need PR help.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.500]   If you're in PR, you go to where the stink is.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500]   Because that's where the money is.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   God, I need some PR people.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.360]   Boy, we stink.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   So come on over.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.040]   Well, you've practiced on the various Google execs, Gaffes over the years.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.740]   And Uber is probably a good place to go.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.740]   I guess so.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.180]   If you can do it at a PR, if you can explain Eric Schmidt, yeah, you can say things from
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.180]   Chairman Schmidt, you can you can do a chairman, Calon, Calonic.
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.140]   Hey, before we get into a Google I/O, I just wanted to mention and I'm curious because
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.580]   here we have Professor of Journalism, City University of New York.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.260]   We have an actual working member of the Tech Press, Ron and Mario.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.420]   We have Kevin Marks and I who just are on the beach.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.420]   Picking oranges.
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.580]   Picking oranges.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.300]   So Vox buys recode.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.580]   Now Vox is the parent company for originally the sports blog SB Nation, but then they did
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.460]   this beautiful thing with the Verge.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.660]   They launched a polygon, which is a gaming blog.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.300]   They also have a Vox blog now.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.140]   So they're kind of a growing site, tech site.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.140]   They buy recode.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.700]   Now the first question I have, because this isn't the end, by the way, there's another
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.580]   bigger fish coming along.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.260]   But the medium sized fish eats the little fish in an all stock transaction.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.640]   I read somebody and I'd love you guys would be better than I to explain this, to explain
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.900]   to me.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.940]   Somebody said that means that recode had run out of money.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.220]   Does that sound credible?
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.500]   I'm thinking that must be kind of what's going on.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.380]   Dan Lyons and Facebook, I just put it up, had a post saying that he argues simply that
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.380]   the economics of online publishing, according to him, are disastrously bad, been clear for
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.380]   years.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.580]   People keep trying.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.100]   New hot sites come along, get VC funding.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.420]   He's saying basically there's no business model there.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.580]   So this is another giga home.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.580]   That's what he's arguing.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.340]   I know with no facts here and other people came in and said you don't have your facts,
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.340]   right, but didn't correct.
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.740]   So I have no idea, but I do want to know what was the business of recode.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.140]   You did get an event business going.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.860]   Code conferences huge.
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.580]   Right now they charge big money for it.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.220]   How many comps they give?
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.380]   But giga home had a number of conferences as well.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.380]   Yes they did.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380]   Yes they did.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.940]   The old thinking was the conference can save you tech crunch.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.940]   Well, it's fine.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.140]   My entrepreneurial students this year, every year there's a kind of a cliche in their businesses.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.380]   Five years ago it was, we'll be viral.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.700]   Now everybody said, we'll have events.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.700]   So events have become the cure all everything.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.020]   That would like to play people who often say to me, why don't you have a Twitter event
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.020]   or something?
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.020]   I think you should.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.020]   Yeah, no, see I'm not doing that, sorry.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.020]   I think you should.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.020]   And then I love this paragraph.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:06.500]   By the way, I might mention that Dan, who was fake Steve Jobs, and then he went to, what
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:13.020]   is it on, he went to like not a tech blog, but some social site.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.260]   But he was going to be their tech blogger.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.260]   It didn't work out.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.940]   He's got the best Boston accent ever.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.900]   Then he was at Gawker for like a week.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.900]   For no time at all.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.180]   And now besides working on a book, which apparently got a good book deal and that's why I quit
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.380]   Gawker, he's the one of the writers for Silicon Valley.
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.380]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:35.540]   And I'm convinced that Dan, I really wonder, you saw Silicon Valley this week, this Kevin
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.540]   Rose joke?
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.540]   I didn't see it now.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.780]   Oh, got to show you the camera.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.500]   Oh, go, go, go, go.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.380]   I guess I can without violating it.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.300]   Well, I'm assuming they've hired him to do the fake Steve Jobs for their fake exec person.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.700]   I'm assuming that's the reason they've got the picture.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.860]   Like he's adding verusimili, he's the verusimilitude guy.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.760]   He's the guy who says, oh, let me tell you, because this year especially has been really
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.020]   right on about funding lots of in tech jokes.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.780]   I don't know how I can play this.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.180]   I think I can't legally play.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.820]   Well, I mean, I can do it illegally.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.820]   I don't think I can do it.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.300]   I'll do it if I can do it.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.180]   Maybe I have to go in.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:21.340]   Let me see if I gives Moto fittingly enough, gives Moto might have the video.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.620]   We offer commentary and it's very useful.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.620]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.620]   Do you?
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.620]   It's commentary.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.620]   We're commenting.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.620]   Yeah, they're going to give them the quote.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.180]   They'll just give you screenshots and quotes.
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.460]   So it's the guy, the jerk from Hoolie, right?
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.700]   Who's talking to his board after a massive failure.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.100]   This is not a spoiler.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.140]   It's a comedy question.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.500]   And then he murders them all.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   Question, what is failure to the ignorant or those in conventional industries?
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.660]   The recent nucleus glitch, nucleus is his product.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.660]   It's a flop.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.820]   May seem like a failure in the negative sets.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.500]   But we in the valley know failures like this one are really stepping stones to bring us
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.220]   the iPhone Steve Jobs first had to bring us the Newton to bring us Facebook.
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:11.100]   Mark Zuckerberg first have to bring us wire hog before he brought us dig.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.400]   Kevin Rose had to bring us a whole lot of useless things and he shows pounce milk and
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.380]   oink and then after dig as well for that man.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.380]   So it's a dig.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.220]   And I wonder though, I wonder, I have to ask Kevin if Dan, because either it's possible
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.780]   Dan has something against him or more likely he thought it'd be funny and why not?
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.780]   Would you mind?
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.780]   I wouldn't mind being a steward.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.780]   It's just fun to be honest.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:43.220]   The negative guy right this post about about recode, he then goes on to say the personal
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.220]   brands.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.220]   Yes.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.220]   Can I read this?
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.220]   Please do.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.980]   All that nonsense about journalists with big personal brands was just that nonsense.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.220]   Walt Mossberg's power came from his association with the journal.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.100]   Pogue was better off at the times.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.500]   Is it Yahoo now?
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.300]   Levy who's at medium was better off and wired.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.020]   Nate Silver was better off at the times 538.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.060]   The late David Carr knew this and I suspect Nick Bilton does too.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.220]   Nick's still at the times.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.660]   He'd be better off still right about tech perhaps.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.260]   Well he's on the fashion.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.900]   The old D conference was powerful because it was attached to the journal.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.980]   Its descendants still draws an audience and still commands a high ticket price but it's
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.980]   not the same.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:25.980]   He's talking about code.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.460]   You know, this is also maybe there's some Schadenfreude.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.460]   Yeah, there is.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.140]   Listen, I think that the other way.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.500]   So was the business of recode great?
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.500]   If it was so great, the other brother wouldn't have sold it.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.140]   However, does recode work for a stock transaction?
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.140]   Yes, right.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.420]   But does recode work well with Vox?
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.420]   Yes.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:48.460]   Vox, I was just, I brought 15 German editors there a week ago and saw a Lockhart steal.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.220]   They're a new boss.
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.940]   And Vox is a really amazing company.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.660]   Jim Backoff has done a wonderful job.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.100]   They have infrastructure, they have ad sales, they have audience.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.300]   Better yet, they have a great CMS.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   Everybody loves it.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.300]   Everybody loves it.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.300]   Do you have a good CMS at our sector?
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.300]   Yes, we do.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.300]   Do you think paragraphs do?
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.900]   You, ours, technical, tech team, is incredible.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:14.300]   There was an article in the New York Times saying the reason people go to work for Vox
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.580]   is because after the interview process they then say, "Well, let us show you how you'll
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.740]   be writing your articles."
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.300]   I wrote posts and text edit on the plane over here.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   That's the man-related.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.300]   You're an IRC.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.260]   You're not using some fancy slack.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.260]   You're an IRC.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.260]   You're a man.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.900]   I wrote a post on my phone from the mall.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.900]   Wow.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.900]   It doesn't matter.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.900]   It doesn't matter.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.540]   Yeah, you can poke with the browser and everything.
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.620]   So then this is the best rumor of all.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.620]   I just love it.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.620]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:51.660]   The bigger, the whales come and apparently Comcast was an investor in both these outlets
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.500]   is going to take them both in.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.500]   And they're all going to be Comcast companies.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.500]   What a fate-worship desk.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.980]   How crazy has journalism been lately?
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.220]   Like Giga Ohm's gone and now there's Zombie Giga Ohm coming back.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.220]   What's the zombie?
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.220]   I didn't hear about that.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.220]   Some company bought him.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.220]   They bought the name.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.220]   They bought the name.
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.220]   Oh, oh, must be just dying inside.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.540]   I don't know who's going to work there.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.260]   Yeah, because Fortune hired five.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.260]   Knowingly.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.260]   Right, everybody had jobs.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.260]   They didn't just stick around.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.540]   But Verizon owns End Gadget and TechCrunch now.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.540]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.540]   End Hough-oh.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.540]   Right.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.540]   And Comcast.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.340]   I'm just going to say we're proud to be bloody independent.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.340]   No.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.340]   Bloody and independent.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.340]   Bloody and independent.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.900]   And we are bloodied, but we're still independent.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:42.940]   But I feel like we've demonstrated there's, I don't know how, but there's a market for
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.940]   tech information.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.740]   Yeah, I think there is.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.020]   Ours does OK, right?
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.020]   Although D.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.140]   I'm spoken for with a giant media conglomerate already.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.140]   Conde bought it.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.140]   That's right.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.140]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.140]   But Conde hasn't messed with it.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.140]   Right.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.140]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.140]   Conde is very smart.
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.740]   And let it be Reddit.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.740]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.740]   Let ours be ours.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.740]   Yeah, which is nice.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:08.260]   I guess you know the worst possible outcome of all of this acquisition.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.260]   What's that?
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.420]   Tech TV and Comcast.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.420]   Tech TV and Comcast.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.420]   I know.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.420]   That's why I shiver when I hear the Comcast.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.420]   But it would make sense.
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.740]   Comcast bought NBC.
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.420]   They want to be a content company.
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.420]   It's disastrous.
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.740]   It's bad for journalists.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.740]   Yeah, it is.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.940]   You don't feel like Verizon running.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.340]   And Gaj is going to be really independently reviewing phones anymore.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:39.580]   As we know, CBS made Cena change their best of CES because they didn't like the hopper.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.900]   Corporate and bad corporations, corporate politics matters.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.780]   When I was at the end of the week, I had a top executive of the company, Com.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.540]   And we graded shows, movies.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.740]   He did a grade point average of what we were doing every week.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.900]   And we were being too mean to Hollywood just as they were emerging with Warner Brothers.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.740]   I could tell you truthfully the real reason that Twitter exists, the sole and only reason
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:07.500]   is to be independent because I just don't want anybody to tell me what I can do and can't
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.500]   do.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.300]   You wouldn't listen anyway.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.900]   No, I got a lot of trouble all the time.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.540]   Although to their credit, Ziff Davis was a good corporate parent.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.900]   Well, they knew they were a publisher, right?
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.580]   They were a good corporate parent.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.820]   So for instance, we were going to publish a guy named Bunny Wong who I love.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.780]   He was an MIT at the time hacked the first Xbox.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.060]   And we were going to put him on and show him how, show everybody how to do it and where
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.060]   to get the chips.
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.940]   And to their credit, Ziff Davis, which knew that Microsoft, which is a big advertiser,
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.700]   would be furious.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.700]   We were nervous.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:48.060]   So we went to our management and said, well, we're going to do this.
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.260]   And they said, go ahead.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.460]   Absolutely.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.460]   They talked to the lawyers.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.060]   They made sure that we weren't breaking any laws, which we weren't.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.460]   But no, they stood up for it.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.460]   But that's the difference.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.380]   But I don't think Comcast would--
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.380]   No.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.380]   No.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.500]   The only hope at a large company like Comcast is you can hide.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.500]   They're so big.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.500]   They won't notice you.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   They won't notice you.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   They're busy running.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.500]   What is it?
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.500]   Like Condi.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.500]   NBC?
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.500]   Yeah, Condi.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.900]   Do you ever go over to the Yorker and hang out?
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.900]   No.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.900]   The world trade center.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.700]   The trade center security is very, very high.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.020]   So you can't even go from floor to floor?
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.380]   I'm allowed to go to my floor in the cafeteria.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.380]   Wow.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.220]   And get harassed by security all the time.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.220]   Wow.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.540]   But it's really fun.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.620]   I bet.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.180]   I bet.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.500]   I think it's great.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.820]   I've always thought the world of ours, and I was really pleased that they let ours be
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.820]   ours.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.820]   And you know what?
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.700]   You're doing more lifestyle stuff than you did before.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.100]   But it still very feels very much like a blog for technology enthusiasts.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.100]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.100]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.660]   Like a culture thing.
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.140]   But not like the Verge basically went hog on this.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.140]   Right.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.020]   We'll do like Star Wars and kind of stop it around that level.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.100]   Oh, look at this.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.100]   Which is cool.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.100]   You do great stuff.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.220]   The female mathematician who changed the course of physics but couldn't get a job.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.220]   That's great.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.380]   Nintendo's first online shooter Splatoon.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.380]   Source Forage grabs GIMP.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.220]   Now see, you're not going to see that on the Verge.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.820]   You're not going to see that on the Verge.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.580]   This is great.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.420]   Still the best.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.420]   All right.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.220]   Here's your, here's your live blog.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.220]   My live blog.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.220]   Yep.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.220]   Two and a half hours of endless, endless.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.220]   Tippity typeity.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.180]   By the way, I've got to ask you a technical question first.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.820]   The Wi-Fi always sucks.
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.140]   The cell lines are all jammed.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.300]   How do you do it?
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.900]   They let the journalists in early this year and there will be power and hard wired ethernet.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.900]   It's going to be so awesome.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.660]   So they want you to live blog.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.660]   Why?
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.660]   Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.860]   Yeah, it's the opposite of Apple.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.940]   But yeah, the front row ethernet thing is a lot of conferences do that.
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.420]   Well it's smart because you've got to bring your help with you.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.780]   It's also, as you remember, Apple telling everybody, "Turn off your Wi-Fi.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.700]   We can't show off this feature."
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.180]   You don't want to have that happen.
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.180]   All right.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.860]   Ron, what are we expecting?
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.860]   Will there be BMX riding skydivers?
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:10.060]   Would there be a giant, Rube Goldberg TikTok clock?
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.100]   The fluff I try not to deal with.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.100]   Come on.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.100]   Well, you don't know.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.580]   That's how we share about here is the fluff.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.900]   Yeah, you'd have to talk to stunt coordinators in the area or something.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.980]   I think they've gotten away from that a little bit.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.180]   Wasn't it your last year they had that next clock?
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.780]   Last year was just a Rube Goldberg thing.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.020]   That clock thing.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:32.220]   But then the giveaway was a piece of cardboard, which I thought was.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.220]   Right.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.220]   Right.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.060]   Yeah, the hardware this year is weird.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.420]   I'm destroying a total blank as far as blank.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.900]   Well, you always pick studies.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.900]   Right.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.260]   I'm not the only one on the side.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.260]   But like--
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.860]   It's not that changed.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.060]   Geeks will say, "Oh, I already have one I didn't use.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.060]   This was a good one."
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.380]   By the way, I've been investigating.
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.380]   I couldn't use the pixel on any of the shows the last generation, but the new-- I don't
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.980]   know if it's Chrome OS, but you can now choose resolutions with Chrome OS.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.980]   Nice.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.980]   Oh.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:03.980]   So I got to bring it in and we got to get--
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.380]   And now that you've ruined your keyboard, you have to have a new computer here.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.380]   Hey, John Slanino, we got to get a Type C to HDMI.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.380]   Yeah, I just didn't have a charger.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.580]   You have two other-- I won from USB here.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.820]   No, but I know I need video out.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.300]   So video comes out of that thing.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   Oh, right.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.300]   Type C can have this.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   Yeah, Apple has them.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.300]   70-- I bought one.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   Yeah, I couldn't.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   79 dollars.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.300]   Goodbye.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.300]   Crumbik for that.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.300]   Hey.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.300]   Hey.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.300]   Fightin' the words, Mark.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.300]   Fightin' the words.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.740]   Well, you can run my Chrome stick for that anyway.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.740]   Oh, Chrome bit.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   That will be one of the things I'm sure they'll show right this year.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.740]   They will give away Chrome bits, I'm sure.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.740]   Yeah, that's what you'll get.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.460]   But I got the geeks, you know, when they gave away the watches and oh, you're all going
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.140]   to get the square watch.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.380]   Oh, you're going to get the round watch.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.380]   Yay!
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.380]   Took them three months, but they finally get either one or three seconds.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.380]   Yeah, I don't even have to go the round watch.
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.180]   They were looking to give Torus in the mouth.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.180]   Right.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.180]   You're getting anything free?
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.820]   I know.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.020]   This year maybe--
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.820]   And the other day.
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:04.820]   --the last year of Bain.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.820]   Oh.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.820]   I'm just thinking-- I'm still on the hard work.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.420]   Oh, still on the free crap you're going to get.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.420]   Yeah, what goodies do you--
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.420]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.980]   I mean, like, my only just straight out guess is maybe they do a Chromecast 2 and everybody
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.980]   gets one of those.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.220]   So what would a-- yeah, that's one of the rumors you have in your-- our story.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.220]   I mean, so--
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.620]   What does a Chromecast 2 have in it?
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.860]   We've had Google executives like publicly talk about, you know, there will be a Chromecast.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.580]   We're working on new hardware.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.900]   It's going to show off a bunch of multi-screen features.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.340]   So, like, you know, you have your phone on and your-- something's happening on your
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.700]   phone while something happens on the screen.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.700]   And there's a lot of--
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.700]   Wow.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.500]   --like hangouts might pop up while I'm watching TV.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.060]   Yeah, I'm not sure I won that.
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:53.180]   I think what they've talked about is like game controller stuff or-- you know, you have
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.340]   some weird little viewfinder on the screen and there's a like full game playing on the
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.620]   television, like a Wii U kind of thing.
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.340]   Well, last year they did that whole thing with the games, the multi-games and the one
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.340]   game and all that stuff.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.100]   They never really did it, right?
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.100]   Right.
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.740]   But they-- I don't know.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:15.500]   They have so many-- they have so many like holes in the Chromecast right now that it's
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.820]   just not up to the task of, I guess, modern video streaming.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.380]   Well, as you point out, you could go to 802.11ac.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.380]   Right.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.620]   You could go to 4K, although I don't know 4K in a stick layer.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.620]   I guess you could go 4K.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.620]   I mean, Android--
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.620]   Okay.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.620]   Like, in terms of keeping up with Android TV, Android TV is going to do 4K and, you know,
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:37.860]   they have boxes coming out that will do AC and all this other fancy connectivity stuff
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.340]   and they need to get that in a little package like the Chromecast.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.340]   Kevin would know.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.340]   That's just two years old now.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.420]   Kevin would know because Kevin was one of the creators of QuickTime.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.340]   So it would require hardware decode, right?
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.780]   Well, for 4K.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.780]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.780]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.300]   Well, or it would require a CPU with a-- yeah, you would only--
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.300]   It's not going to be the CPU.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.940]   It's going to be hardware.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.140]   It's going to fit it in something that's small and--
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.140]   --with no--
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.140]   --assip falling.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.140]   Right.
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.140]   They can do VP9 on hardware.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.140]   Are there-- I guess there are Raspberry Pi, I think, does-- has the hardware decode.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.140]   There are some.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.140]   I don't know how much they--
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.060]   I'd be surprised if they do a 4K Chromecast right now, but unless they're just doing
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.700]   it to show off because the point of it is that it's everywhere and there isn't that much
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.700]   4K content yet.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.700]   I put that out--
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.900]   Well, there's Netflix.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.140]   And that's one of the chief features of a Chromecast is Netflix.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.140]   Right.
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.380]   And YouTube does 4K and CR and 3D and every other one of the--
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.980]   That's a really important point.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.620]   If they want to show off what YouTube could do.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.620]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.620]   This is YouTube stuff.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.620]   It's the YouTube cast.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.620]   Yes.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.620]   You can't.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.620]   You can't.
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.620]   Do better.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.620]   Is this sound-- is the sound stuff?
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.220]   It's quite-- I have-- I've not managed to get the Chromecast to give me decent surround
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.220]   sound.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.220]   Really?
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.660]   I mean, they didn't even license a Dolby decoder.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.900]   Maybe they just--
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.580]   I mean, the problem is that they're feeding-- they're feeding into the TV.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.580]   I'm not sure.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.340]   I don't know the details of what audio specs they're feeding into the TVs there and how
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.580]   stable those are.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.740]   So maybe they're just doing Dolby over stereo and relying on the decoder.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.100]   It's worth to do it.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.460]   But I was playing with this before thinking, OK, I've got all these things that work on
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:25.140]   Chromecast, well, any of them feed 5.1 around to my TV system and I couldn't get it to work.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.340]   So that may be something that-- and I'm not sure if that's a hardware limitation or it's
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.540]   just that they haven't spent time on it.
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.500]   But that would be something that would be-- I would assume would be something you could
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.500]   improve.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.380]   I would be something that I would assume only you would even know.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.300]   We are so-- we don't care about audio.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:45.860]   We've been conditioned by an iPod to listen to crappy audio.
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.380]   I never-- ever hear anybody say I want better audio.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.900]   Does this do any of you think really sound better?
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.900]   I don't know.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.660]   That's an honest answer.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.660]   For how much it is that's--
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.660]   I bought it.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.660]   I love it.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.660]   I listened to it.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:07.260]   I just bought a rebought for the seventh or eighth time the entire Beatles at 24-bit
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:13.060]   because I found a little USB metal apple that has the 2009 remaster in 24-bit.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.100]   I have to ask Kevin Tofel about this.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:23.500]   But it's really hard to separate psychology versus actual hearing, right?
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.340]   It sounds better to be.
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.260]   Adding more sample rate or adding more bit death doesn't actually help very much.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.900]   What helps setting more channels, and particularly for the Chromecast, it's in the device that
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.380]   is most likely plugged into multiple speakers.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.220]   If there's one place in your home you have got a decent speaker set up.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.500]   It's attached to the TV.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.220]   So that would make sense to me as a--
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.220]   Sure.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.380]   --as a direction to move in.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.500]   And it makes-- it makes me as an audio thing as well.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.220]   I've had this debate at SF Music Tech with the Pono advocates and things.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.980]   There's a lot of woo in the stuff they're selling.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.580]   There's a lot of woo in the stuff they're selling.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.580]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.580]   There was--
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.180]   Oh, snake oil.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.540]   They have guys who-- they have old music guys who's hearing probably rolls off at 2K,
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.300]   saying that they can hear the difference.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:16.940]   And they say-- and the digital stuff is like fluorescent lighting versus natural lighting.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.620]   They talk about a woo like that.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:29.380]   Actually, practically, digital sampling in AV test is-- at 44K stereo, you can't really
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:34.860]   tell that apart from the higher stuff when they actually do empirical tests.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.460]   So adding extra bit depth and adding extra sample rate is something you use for mixing
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.980]   because there you want to move things by fractions of a sample because you're trying
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:48.660]   to fix phase and you want to do multiple layer mixing and balancing at high resolution
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.260]   before you mix down.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.060]   So having them for studio recording and for mixing--
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.060]   Right.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.060]   --gives you headroom.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.460]   I would have acted like I understood that.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.460]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.220]   Well, basically, it gives you room to move.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.860]   But once you're listening to it, you don't need that.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.860]   Now, I've also-- here's what I know.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.060]   I'm going to interrupt you briefly.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.540]   Because we're going to get to the Nyquist theorem and all that.
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:17.060]   But here's what I've been reading lately is it's for sure the case that the super high
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:25.500]   sample rates of 192 kilohertz are creating distortion and weird effects that may be perceived
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.300]   by people like me and Neil Young as being better.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.180]   You know, ringing and weird things.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.900]   That's absolutely true.
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.260]   It seems to be even-- pretty serious recording engineers agree.
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.820]   Sample-- and this isn't mastering, obviously, what you're saying, Kevin.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.220]   It may not matter later.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:48.500]   But at mastering, a sample rate of, let's say, double CD, which is 88.2, would be fine.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.940]   88.224 bit would be as good as you ever needed, probably.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.700]   Well, the thing is they normally master it, $48.96 or $1.02.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.700]   Right.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.980]   So they're already doing a sample rate conversion to $44.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:04.940]   Well, one of the things Neil Young said is that conversion because it's not having or
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.940]   doubling is not going to be as good as if you did 88.2.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.940]   Eh.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.260]   Um, two, not really.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.260]   I mean--
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.260]   OK, I got it.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.820]   Not these days.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.820]   You could--
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.820]   So title--
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:23.660]   The thing is, depending what you're doing, you do enough time stretching and mixing and
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.780]   bouncing around in the mix these days anyway that doing a sample rate conversion is pretty
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   pretty--
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.580]   What's absolutely true is the room, the speakers, the reproduction, all of that have much more
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.580]   impact--
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.780]   Your age, my ears, all have much more impact than what the original--
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:41.740]   But the things that actually matter are more channels.
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.740]   That's good.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.740]   I'll buy that.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.900]   If you have a 5.1 mix of something, especially if a concert recording or a classical thing
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:51.540]   or something like that, and you have 5.1 speakers or 7.1 speakers, that is definitely
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.540]   better.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.540]   You can hear that better.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.660]   It'll give you a better sense of the presence of the room.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.460]   There's more going on there.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.860]   The challenge is not many places have 5.1 speakers or 7.1 speakers, but the place you do
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.380]   have them is attached to your TV.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.820]   This is why doing that with the Chromecast and the TV attached things makes more sense
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.500]   than elsewhere.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.260]   The other thing that matters is having isolated tracks, having multiple tracks that you can
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.540]   take a part of put back together again.
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:22.940]   That's something that is valuable for people to want to remix it, valuable for people who
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.140]   could potentially remix on the fly.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.060]   There's a market for that.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.340]   There are already people who sell-- they call them stems.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.740]   They would sell isolated tracks of all the different pieces in the mix so that you can
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.180]   remake the mix yourself.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.180]   That's fun.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.300]   That's also a valuable thing that they can sell as music and makes more sense than the
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.300]   Pono thing.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.540]   Whereas Pono, they're just saying, "We're taking the final mix and we're giving you
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.700]   more bits of the final mix," which is great for people.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.860]   Well, to be honest, probably if there is a benefit to the Pono, it's also a higher quality
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.820]   DAC and a higher quality amplifier.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.700]   They use a very good DAC.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.060]   Yeah, but you can--
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.060]   I know.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.060]   That's completely marginal.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.300]   The Apple Gear has actually got a pretty good DAC.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.140]   Probably your low in Android has a DAC.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.140]   That's probably true.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.420]   Yeah, that's one of the reasons I say that people don't care about audio is that I was
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.580]   very-- I thought this year would be the year that phones would have better audio, like
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.580]   higher quality audio.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.580]   And then nobody's made any effort in that.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.580]   But there's one that's--
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.580]   What about that?
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:22.580]   I mean--
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.580]   Between them, that's--
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:27.060]   The rise of headphones, the rise of headphones, good headphones, not--
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:32.060]   Heaven's like I'm wearing, means that there is an audience for better audio now.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.060]   That's true.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.060]   Because everybody's wearing beats, so we know.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.060]   Oh my god.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:42.060]   The point is, if you go to the electronics shop now, like a third of the aisles of headphones.
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.060]   You know why, Kevin?
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.100]   It's a very high margin business.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.300]   You could take $10 with the components that charge 400 bucks for it because it's got magic
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.060]   sauce, just like the Pono, I think.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.060]   I don't know.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.060]   There's a bunch of that in two.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:59.060]   But some of it is, there is a difference between a speaker like this that I paid 10 bucks
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.420]   for and the one that goes in.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.740]   I bought very expensive magnetic planar headphones.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.740]   Oh no, there's this.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.700]   They sound really good because I spent a lot of money.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.460]   And we're going to move on because this is not the--
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.700]   I don't think Google I/O will be all about it audio.
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.700]   Somebody in the chat room is--
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.700]   I think there's a problem.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.700]   Say again.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.700]   One more little thing into this?
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.700]   Yes.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.100]   Google has, which is the latency of audio and Android.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:31.100]   Let's talk about that because there's this 10-millisecond kind of baked-in latency that
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.100]   is a real problem.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.780]   It's one of the reasons I understand that you don't see a lot of performance-- performing
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.180]   music apps on Android because the latency would kill you.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.740]   Why is it there?
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.740]   Because it's like a really deep design problem in the operating system.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.540]   That's why it's not fixed.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:56.860]   The way Linux works is that it has a pull model for audio.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.300]   Have I got this wrong?
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.380]   Basically, the way-- I'll just go back the other way.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.260]   The way Linux works works the old-fashioned way and underneath Android is Linux, which
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.340]   means that it ends up with lots of buffers of audio.
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.220]   And everything adds buffers to make sure that it doesn't have a gap.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.820]   And so you end up with more and more latency.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.500]   There's a good-- something did a very good analysis of different Android phones and how
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.500]   much latency there is.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.380]   The dot com has a-- that's the one.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.220]   Really good article explaining this if you want to know more.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:29.020]   So first time I'd ever heard of it-- the deadline is bearing this a bit because it isn't
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:29.860]   a 10-millisecond problem.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.620]   The problem is that it's like-- it's a hundred milliseconds for any of the phones.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.620]   Right.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.700]   It's additive because it's not just-- it's here and there.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.700]   Right.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.900]   Every time audio latency, like every year, the way they do audio and performance-- oh,
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.900]   we've got it down.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:43.900]   Oh, they do.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.900]   They're smart.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.900]   They know this.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.900]   They've addressed it.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.620]   Because they've got to structurally change the way the operating system works to do it.
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.620]   So the difference is that--
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.100]   Is it the Java VM or is it--
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.100]   No, no.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.020]   It's the way interrupts work with the operating system.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:02.580]   So the way interrupts work on iOS, there's a special interrupt that's just for audio.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:08.900]   It has higher priority than memory paging and it's round robin called, which means that
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.860]   you can build an audio pipeline that has very low latency because you can guarantee that
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.740]   it will happen every 64 samples.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.780]   With Android, they're on the Linux model.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:24.420]   The audio pipeline is not working with buffers that small.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.660]   And also, it can't do the chasing the head thing where the read point is chasing the
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.980]   right pointer because they can't guarantee that they don't cross.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.980]   Whereas on iOS and Mac OS, they know that they won't.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.980]   So what that means is that there is just more latency at every stage of the process.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.220]   So the problem is the kernel.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.220]   You'd have to--
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.220]   Yes.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.220]   You'd have to change the micro kernel to fix this.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.220]   The kernel.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:51.740]   You would have to change the model-- that automatically explains it.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.860]   But you have to change the way audio is processed.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:59.500]   It's such that there are high priority interrupts on iOS, pulling audio through the system and
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.860]   things feeding into it.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.100]   Whereas on Android, you're pushing audio into buffers and the buffers are getting played
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.100]   out.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.780]   So it ends up being not 10 milliseconds, but as much as 100 milliseconds each way or
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:17.180]   100, one fifth of a second round trip, which is enough to really kill the beat.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.180]   It's like--
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.060]   But it was so each and the power of the process is doing the same thing.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.660]   So on iOS, they made it pull the audio all the way through the process.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.300]   Whereas on Android, because you're pushing it in, you push a buffer in.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.460]   And then when you're processing it, you pull a buffer and push a buffer and pull a buffer.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.620]   So each stage in that chain makes it worse.
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.620]   Is this still a problem in lollipop?
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.020]   Yeah, you still don't have music apps and mixers and--
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.140]   No, I don't see any of it.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:48.780]   Any of them that you do see are made by third party hardware solutions.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.780]   Oh, interesting.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.780]   So you do--
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.780]   Yeah, OK.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.780]   You can't do it in software.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:59.060]   Or you have to-- basically, they have to write it once for each device.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.780]   This is not an issue for somebody listening to music.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.740]   But the reason this is going-- well, it can be an issue for listening to music.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.900]   It means that when you do track skips and things like that, then you get more lag.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.780]   And the Bluetooth play out has more lag on Android.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.780]   Oh, but come on.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.180]   I mean, we're not talking a second.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.020]   We're talking a fraction of a second.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.020]   No, but it can be a second.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.020]   That's the problem.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.580]   Because by the time you buff it up through a series of things that are all doing this
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.660]   wrong, you get that problem.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:27.580]   But the reason they're going to have to fix this is the VR stuff.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.580]   Because--
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.580]   Yes, latency is--
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.580]   You've got latency.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.580]   You've got latency.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.100]   When you're doing that and the audio isn't moving, you fall out of the world.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.900]   Suddenly, the birds aren't staying over there.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:37.900]   When they turn their head, the birds are lagging.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.900]   Is that a problem?
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.900]   Absolutely.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.900]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.540]   But the bar problem is visual, I think, in most cases.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.860]   But nonetheless, if you had audio latency, that's going to be a huge problem if your
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.460]   audio drags behind this video.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.380]   That's not a good idea.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:56.980]   So in order to get the headset stuff working well, they're going to have to fix this.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.820]   And I suspect they aren't going to have to change the kernel to do this, which is the
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.820]   big operation.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.980]   It basically means ripping out the guts of Linux, having a giant fight with Linus about
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.180]   it because he doesn't care.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.980]   And going through that process.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.020]   The chat room was saying that it was actually Linus's choices that created this problem
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.020]   in the beginning.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.060]   I put this the way around.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:24.460]   It's more that when they were doing Mac OS X, they hired audio people who actually cared
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.460]   about this.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.460]   Yeah.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.460]   And I was working with them at the time.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.340]   So there were all musicians.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.740]   They all wanted to use their Macs as effects processors, and they didn't want to have to
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.580]   have racks in there to do that.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.820]   How is when they insisted that, you know, they also, they also, Windows is, is, is,
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.900]   is the same problems.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.260]   I mean, they've got, they, what Windows has is like four separate overlaid APIs for doing
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.660]   audio, some of which are better than others.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.940]   Because, but the basic level of interrupt stuff is, is still pretty bad, I think.
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.900]   They may, they may have changed it more recently.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.380]   I haven't, I haven't written audio code on Windows for 10 years.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:07.020]   So any of the phone OEMs fix this themselves, Samsung or Sony?
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.500]   They're awesome.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.580]   Some proprietary APIs, but then you've got a right to the Samsung API and things like
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.580]   that.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.660]   Like this is amplitude specifically for Samsung devices.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.300]   Is this for your guitar?
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.300]   This is, yeah.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.540]   So this is guitar amp simulation.
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.340]   And the gear VR is basically the video version of this where, you know, we sat down with
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:30.340]   Samsung and tweaked their exact implementation of, you know, video to get latency down.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.340]   Because they'd have to fix it for gear VR.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.340]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.460]   This is Oculus, Oculus is using Android, right?
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.780]   I mean, the gear is an Oculus slash on the project.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.780]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.940]   I want this.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.940]   This is going to come out tomorrow.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:51.180]   I don't know if Google will show it at Google I/O, but the new Nvidia Shield Android TV version,
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.100]   before you run out and buy a Chromecast.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.860]   This plays games, 4K movies.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:05.940]   It's kind of a console with a Tegrax one in it and three gigs of memory.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:06.940]   How much?
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.940]   Oh, I know.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.940]   The shields are more expensive.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.940]   I know.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.940]   I don't know.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.940]   Have they announced a price?
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.740]   The chat room mentioned this.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.060]   This looks really, this looks like something.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.460]   I have a fire TV and I've never connected it.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:25.260]   I have, I don't think I had a Google TV and I was, I, 199 bucks.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.260]   Well, okay.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.260]   So that's twice?
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.580]   That's the 16 gig.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.580]   I don't.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.180]   The, there is a rumored 500 gigabyte version.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.500]   There should be a story.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.660]   What do you think?
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.220]   And it's, it's really nice.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.180]   It is the next generation of Android TV, definitely.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.420]   Like I have, I have an XS player and that thing can't play 1080p videos smoothly.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.420]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   So that's sad.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.420]   Oh yeah.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.420]   It lags all over the place.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.420]   It's, it's just terrible.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.580]   But this thing, it was planned 4K video content at 60 frames a second.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.580]   Wow.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.580]   Like buttery smooth.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.580]   I'm buying it.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.580]   You can plug all this stuff into the USB ports.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.580]   You know, it's, it's Android.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.180]   So you can plug in webcams and, and.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:07.060]   Ecosystem support because, you know, it's competing with me for my Xbox One.
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.020]   We'd take the same slot, right?
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.940]   So an Xbox One has a good ecosystem.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.180]   I got a lot of great games.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:16.980]   I mean, the best games are well, at least competitive to Sony.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.220]   It's got most of the media stuff that I want to do.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.220]   Right.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.580]   Like it seems like Android TV with, with the shield has a good hardware platform, but
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:29.100]   does anyone want to spend $200 on this when you can get an Xbox, what you can get an
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.380]   Xbox 360 for that much.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.380]   That's true.
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.380]   Hulu plus Pandora, Vivo, Red Bull TV.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.940]   I didn't even know that existed.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.580]   YouTube crackleplex.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.580]   That's important.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.580]   Tune in.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.900]   We're on that so you could listen to us.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.020]   Games though, these are Android games, aren't they?
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.020]   Basically.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.020]   Yes.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.180]   And videos going to try to do their own game store thing.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.540]   But no, I mean, the, the, there's still Android games at the end of the day.
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.860]   But I can play Doom 3.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.100]   Come on.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.060]   They, so they have the 16 gigabyte version listed.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.060]   Grand Theft Auto 5 is 65 gigabytes.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   Oh.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:10.940]   So there's the difference between Android games and real games.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:11.940]   They're just not on the same other way.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:12.940]   All right.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:13.940]   Back to runs.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.700]   You didn't do this on a phone.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.700]   No.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.700]   Runs.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:21.740]   Outline of what we expect for Google I/O.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.460]   So that's the Chromecast slash.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.460]   Maybe they'll show the shield too.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.540]   I mean, it's their platform.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.020]   Shield one.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.020]   Shield one.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.580]   Yeah, the shield's not out yet.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.940]   Well, that's maybe tomorrow.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.940]   Right.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.940]   Right.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:34.940]   That's what I'm thinking, right?
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.900]   Yeah, that'll be your future Android TV box.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.020]   Android M. What do we know?
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.780]   Fingerprint API, which is nice.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:47.340]   My, I like my S6 has the fingerprint reader, which I understand is not Samsung's, but comes
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.540]   from, who's the fingerprint reader from?
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.140]   The one same people who do the.
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.140]   Snaptics?
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.140]   Yes, an aptics.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.140]   Which is better than Apple's.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.380]   Oh, the on the Galaxy S6?
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.380]   Pretty good.
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.380]   It's pretty close.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.380]   Maybe Apple a little faster.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.540]   But it's pretty close.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:07.020]   On the Galaxy S6, it's a Naptic, or I'm sure I'm saying the name wrong, whatever.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.020]   Snaptics, yeah.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.020]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.020]   Okay.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.140]   It's that hardware, but Samsung's proprietary API for the fingerprint stuff.
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.900]   But now there'll be a fingerprint ecosystem in M.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:17.900]   That's the guess.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.100]   I mean, this is all research stuff that I'm, you know, that I'm hoping.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.100]   No, Ron.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.100]   This is, this is.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.100]   This is.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.100]   This is the facts, Jacks.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:30.500]   No, but yeah, you know, you need a fingerprint API so that developers can make stuff and so
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.020]   that OEMs will actually put a fingerprint reader in their phone.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.020]   S6 is pretty good.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.460]   I can use LastPass.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:42.620]   I can, Samsung's web browser will let me log on to websites using fingerprint.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.300]   I can use Google Wallet with it.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.300]   I mean, it's pretty.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.340]   It's just, you know what?
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.220]   It's more extensive than Apple, because Apple only, only Apple supports their fingerprint
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.220]   reader.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.420]   Oh, no third party apps.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.980]   Well, wait a minute, no LastPass does.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.180]   I'm sorry, I take that back.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.180]   No, I lied.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.380]   In fact, all the same stuff.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.900]   Passbook works with it.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.180]   I take it back.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.420]   You shouldn't ask me about Apple stuff.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.180]   I don't really understand Apple very well.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.180]   Okay.
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.340]   Well, hopefully you'll be able to use your fingerprint to do Android Pay, which the difference
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.700]   between that and what's that from wallet?
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   How does that?
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.700]   Right.
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.700]   Exactly.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.700]   The difference between that and wallet is going to be branding.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.100]   The name, you know, Apple did their Apple.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.100]   Oh, it's Apple Pay.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.100]   So we've got a right pay.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.620]   Yeah, so we've got to, you know, rename everything.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:28.260]   And I mean, you know, so they got to relay put all the point of sale systems.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.820]   They've already got lagers on.
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:30.820]   That seems.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.620]   No, they just have those fish bones.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.140]   It doesn't actually say.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.140]   Right.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.140]   Usually it doesn't say Google wallet.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.140]   There's a W on it.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.140]   So they have to.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.140]   Yeah, it's called the Google.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.940]   They should named it Android Way, and then they wouldn't have to change the W.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.660]   But they're like, they're supposed to be some kind of API to let other apps plug into the
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.660]   pay system.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:49.660]   That's nice.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.380]   I don't, I'm not sure what other apps want to do with that.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.780]   But I guess Amazon could have you do, you know, fulfillment, Android pay or whatever.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.460]   Of course, Samsung's trying to do the same thing with Samsung Pay.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.660]   They've got, they bought loop pay.
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.740]   They're trying to work with swipe readers as well as tap to pay readers.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.300]   I would love to try loop pay.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.460]   Like it's in the phone and they need some kind of.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.660]   They haven't turned it on.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.660]   Right.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.660]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.180]   Do you use an S6?
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.940]   Is that your phone of choice?
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.940]   No, I have a Nexus.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:15.940]   Nexus.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.940]   I know it.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.940]   I've got to stick with the stock Android.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.300]   But it's going to have Android M on it next week.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.340]   So next week tomorrow.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.300]   Oh, developer version.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.300]   Sure.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.300]   Oh, he's special.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.300]   Yeah, special.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.300]   And I'm guessing.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.300]   Yes.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.300]   And he's guessing.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.300]   Oh, no, that's what happened.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.300]   Get your five invite.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   No, no, even you.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.300]   Yeah, I know.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.300]   Even you.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   What about you?
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   No, five, five tough.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.860]   I don't, I don't know too many people that have even covered it.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.860]   We all got that email that said we're going to get it before summer's.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.180]   All right, check back in the summer.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.060]   I think most of the people that got invited were people that said they don't have a Nexus
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.180]   6 and need to buy an Nexus 6.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.180]   That's evil.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:00.500]   Oh, I thought we'd have an advantage as a 6 owner.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.500]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.140]   Oh, that's evil.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.780]   Check my other email address.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.220]   Don't be, I know, you know what?
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.980]   Every day I check for Google Fi.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.420]   I'm such an idiot.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.820]   Oh my God.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.380]   Did I get the invite today?
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.380]   No.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.380]   What else?
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.380]   Let's go back to it.
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.380]   Let's go back to it.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:22.540]   When you do get it, would you, would you have, if you're me, would you change your number
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:23.540]   to it?
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.140]   I've got an AT&T, grandfather unlimited account.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:31.620]   Grandfather, good news is unlimited, bad news is I can't tether.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:36.540]   Oh, well, you're not getting unlimited.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.540]   I don't think Google Fi.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:41.420]   I think I'm sure you've talked about it as many times on all about Android is a price
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.420]   competitor.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.340]   It's the same price.
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.340]   It depends.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.500]   You get the option to save money if you don't use your internet.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.580]   Well, you get the option to do that.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.580]   I'm fine.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.580]   If you don't use data, yeah, you pay for too much data.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.580]   Oh, you pay more.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.580]   All right.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:43:59.580]   I guess you only pay for what you use.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.580]   I'm in your room.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.580]   You're right.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.580]   You're right.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.580]   I'm drunk.
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:04.580]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.580]   What does the M stand for, really?
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.580]   Marshmallow, meringue, pie, Mars, Mars, and Pan?
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.380]   Just like last year, last year we had L.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.380]   It's just L.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.380]   And they're not going to say anything.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.380]   It's just going to be M.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.380]   Although it's good.
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.460]   The T does have macadamia nut cookies sprinkled throughout.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.460]   That's an internal--
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.460]   Right.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.020]   Which they do that.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.940]   So that's just to tease you.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:22.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:23.940]   Wait a minute.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.940]   Chris Michael in our chat room says--
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:25.940]   Couldn't it be Eminem?
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.940]   If there's going to be any T should be M&Ms.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.380]   Or here's some macadamia nut cookies.
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.380]   Nice.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.380]   Let's just try them.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.900]   Just to see if it would be a good operating system name.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:36.900]   What do you think?
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:37.900]   I'm allergic.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.900]   To macadamia nuts?
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.900]   Oh, my god.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.900]   Or to cookies.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:41.900]   No macadamia-- no, not cookies.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.900]   Can't you tell?
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:43.900]   No.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.380]   You're like a skin and bone.
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.260]   Somebody in the chat room, Chris Michael said he got his fine fight.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.220]   And you're right.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.060]   He does not own an excess six.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.060]   Oh, great.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.460]   Oh, conspiracy theory.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:02.620]   So I hope you're going to make back that what $600 on your hopefully cheaper cell phone
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:03.620]   service?
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:04.620]   Yeah, I know.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.620]   That's just like a wild thing.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.620]   I have to get so much cheaper.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:09.380]   Are you allergic, Ronna?
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.380]   No.
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.380]   I'm not allergic at all.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.380]   White chocolate macadamia.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.380]   All right.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.420]   A $1,400 Intel Google Tag Hoyer smartwatch?
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.420]   No.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.900]   Even I, even I, Google schmuck that I am.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:24.900]   Would you buy that?
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:25.900]   No.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.900]   No.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.460]   This is going to be updated.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.460]   It's going to be out of date.
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.460]   I mean, it's no.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.020]   Yeah, all of this $10 billion smart watch stuff is ridiculous.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.020]   It is.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.420]   I mean, and listen, I like this thing.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.460]   But the software is the same.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:44.260]   I would not spend huge amounts of money for that.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.900]   This Apple Watch is looking mighty fine right now.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.900]   It's square.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.900]   I can't deal with square.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.620]   Look, before all this Apple Watch stuff, we would do the Android Wear watches.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:58.900]   And if it was square, it was an immediate no get out of my face with that square watch.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:45:59.900]   Wow.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:00.900]   And then Apple came along and all of a sudden--
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:01.900]   It's OK.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:02.900]   Square is cool.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:03.900]   All of a sudden, Square is fine.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.420]   All the kids are wearing square watches.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.420]   Whatever.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:11.140]   No, it would be neat if they actually did $1,400 worth of technology.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.420]   What I'm sure they're going to do is take a $200 watch and put it in a $1,000 case.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.660]   Or what is the Moto Now?
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.660]   Moto 360 is now $150.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.580]   That's what the vehicles say love, yeah.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.980]   Because, of course, they're blowing them out.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.340]   Do you think they'll announce something?
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.740]   No, Moto doesn't usually do that.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.540]   Moto Roll is working on a second one.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:27.540]   I know.
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.540]   They've been doing teasers.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   But they wouldn't announce it tomorrow.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.020]   Well, though, the partners do come and announce things.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.060]   You might have five new partners for the watches.
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.980]   Hey, Android Car, we're starting to see some Android Car.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.380]   Hyundai just announced.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.460]   I'm excited that the Sonata is going to have it.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.740]   I am so ready for this.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.900]   I am too.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.900]   That will also be an M feature, yeah?
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.100]   That's a right now feature.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.860]   You just plug your lollipop--
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.180]   Yeah, that was a lollipop thing.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.060]   They announced this last year.
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:54.580]   Right.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.260]   And because we're moving at the speed of car manufacturer,
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.340]   it has only come out right now, which is just excruciating.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.900]   So I have to buy a new Hyundai?
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:03.900]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.060]   Or you can get a really horrible rip-off pioneer.
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.020]   That's a aftermarket head-end.
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:09.820]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.900]   The $700 one has a resistive touch screen.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:14.420]   So you know--
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.060]   Resistive is the worst.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.620]   Right, a plastic bubble that you put--
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.620]   Oh.
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:19.140]   Oh.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.300]   For a capacitive that will run you $1,400 bucks.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.620]   Yeah, yeah, Karamba.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.780]   We had Phil Nickinson of Android Central
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:26.820]   was on the show last night.
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.060]   He's been playing around with that for the last couple
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.100]   of months when I understand.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.940]   The $700 resistive screen.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.540]   He said it's actually not that bad considering the fact
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.340]   that you don't do a lot of fine kind of dragging on it.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.940]   You're kind of ham-visting controls
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:41.620]   when you're in the car.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:42.620]   So like just going boom.
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:43.420]   I have $700.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:43.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:44.700]   It's different.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.220]   But no, $700 is expensive for--
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.900]   A Nexus 7 was 200 bucks.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.660]   Is that or is that or buying a Hyundai?
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.580]   True.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.580]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.820]   You have to buy a Sonata?
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.380]   Is that the only Hyundai that has--
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:57.180]   Yes.
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:57.700]   Right now.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:58.540]   Oh, they're nice looking cars.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.940]   Yeah, others will come out soon.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.100]   The other brands will start soon.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.180]   But this is the first car that will actually be out with it.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:03.680]   Yes.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.540]   Scooter X in our chatroom says GM says 14 models of Chevy's--
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:08.060]   Oh, did that happen yet?
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.420]   Will feature Andre Otto this year.
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:10.940]   OK, yes.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.140]   I was at that event yesterday.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.580]   I wasn't sure what time it is.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.080]   Ah.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.580]   But yes.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.500]   So Chevy's doing 14 models, which
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.500]   is basically their entire lineup.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.980]   Because I mean, they only have like 16 cars or something.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.660]   Now I do want a Camaro.
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.780]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:27.780]   You could get that.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:28.820]   Because that's--
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.820]   I knocked it by a Chevy's spark.
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:32.900]   I get a Volt.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:33.900]   I've got a Volt.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:34.780]   Volt's cool.
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.020]   The new Volt's are weird.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:36.460]   They are?
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:36.980]   Are they?
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.980]   They look like Honda Civics with crazy girls.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.660]   All right, I'll get a Malibu.
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.180]   Or an Impala, my grandma and Joanna.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:44.700]   Yeah, I just--
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:45.740]   Yeah, they have one.
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.060]   Yeah, they have one there.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.460]   Year after year.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.580]   And then bench seats.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:50.140]   I loved it.
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.900]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.340]   The Volt, the Suburban, the Colorado, the Tahoe, the Silverado,
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.100]   the Camaro, the Malibu, and the Cruz.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.180]   Unless it's a transit van, it'll probably
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.340]   run Android Auto and CarPlay.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.900]   I'm really feeling like this is the way I want to go,
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.660]   because I don't care what kind of car.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.660]   And I have a very fancy Audi.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.140]   Its built-in system is junk compared
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.100]   to the state of the art in the multiples.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.380]   Nobody over there has ever heard of like a 60 frames
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.940]   for second animation or smoothie.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.820]   Oh, are you kidding?
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:20.180]   It does have Google Map.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:24.540]   Google-- you know, Google Earth in it.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.860]   From how long ago?
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.260]   No, no, it's updated online.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.100]   Oh, OK.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:28.980]   This is where we--
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.500]   So I can see the top of the cruise.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:34.340]   Did it drive you into a lake?
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.900]   No, it didn't drive me into a lake.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.220]   I was driving down my driveway.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.700]   It thought I was in a lake.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.300]   Right.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.780]   Yeah, well, there's a difference.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:41.940]   I was dry.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.740]   OK.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.660]   So I got fixed.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.660]   That was fixed.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.340]   It wasn't Google's fault.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.540]   It was just an antenna, bad antenna.
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.180]   Finally, the Audi people said, oh, yeah, we found it.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:52.820]   It's bad antenna.
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:53.260]   They replaced it.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.020]   It's not been a problem.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.460]   It's good that your car has connectivity, because--
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.940]   Yeah, 3G, T-Mobile.
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:58.940]   Right.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.660]   In the summer, you'll be able to upgrade the car on your own,
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.100]   because they've sold the cars already.
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.300]   They'll be able to upgrade the car on your own by going
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.340]   to your computer, plugging in a USB stick,
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.460]   downloading the software, sneaker netting it out.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.100]   Doing an image for your car.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.180]   I can do that one last time.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.260]   And I never had the nerve quite to do that.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.140]   Yeah, and I'm like, the car really doesn't have Wi-Fi?
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.900]   I can't--
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.260]   No, I have a--
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.620]   I have a T-Mobile SIM in my car.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.460]   OK, and a phone bill for your car.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.540]   Elisa pays it.
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.460]   I don't know.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.620]   Somebody probably pays it.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.660]   Yeah, I actually don't remember.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.940]   But I think you pay yearly.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:38.940]   I don't know.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.460]   OK.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.340]   Hey, Lisa, do I have a phone bill for my car?
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.900]   Do I have a phone number for my car?
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.500]   Google now, will there be changes?
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.140]   Google now.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.780]   What should I say?
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:51.580]   What do you know?
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.940]   What can I say?
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.300]   Probably what should I say?
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.260]   Nothing.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.180]   Do you know something?
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.540]   No.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.900]   No, don't lie to the man.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.380]   No something.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.860]   OK, we do this with Annie and I, just tuck your ear
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.340]   if you can't talk.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.620]   No, the fun--
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.940]   You was lectured beforehand to tell you nothing.
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.860]   By multiple people.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.500]   What did Aparna Chenopregata say to you?
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.020]   No.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:16.620]   How do you like that?
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.820]   I put that right off.
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:18.540]   That was good.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.900]   But a Chenopregata, my buddy.
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:21.220]   Oh, what?
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.020]   Oh, I have-- what?
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.500]   OK, Google now API.
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.660]   Sure, yeah.
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:25.260]   Yeah, you wrote it.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.660]   So like apps--
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.660]   This is what you wrote.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.340]   So you can say whatever you wrote.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:30.980]   OK, right.
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.540]   Because apps--
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.340]   Right, apps will be able to like, well, eventually.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:39.780]   Apps will be able to supply Google now cards on their own.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:40.580]   Like--
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.820]   Yeah, we knew that.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:43.860]   Right, there's a pilot program going on already.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.180]   But I mean, that's what this is.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:48.580]   It's just stuff that they're working on.
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.100]   All that.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.940]   Do you have a macro key on your phone
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.140]   for Anna Parnachina-Pregata?
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.900]   No, I've copy-paced.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:55.420]   You should.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.020]   You copy-paced.
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.860]   And extensive Google need to make sure you get all the files
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.900]   in the right time.
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.220]   No, I'm excited about the virtual reality stuff,
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.100]   just because it's-- we know next to nothing.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:06.980]   And it's super scary.
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.300]   Good, good changes subject there, Phil.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:08.780]   I think--
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:09.300]   Very good.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:13.300]   I think that I've been told by people in the know
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.420]   that we're going to see a surprisingly large amount
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.980]   of cardboard.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:23.420]   Who is it that just left head of Google search design
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.060]   to go work on the cardboard team?
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.180]   All the cardboard OS.
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.420]   And I'm forgetting his name, and I'm very sad because--
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.620]   We had it on the run now last week, I forget.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:33.700]   But yeah, like, I mean, you're going
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:38.220]   to go from billions of people to this little tiny cardboard
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.820]   team from what we know, which is--
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:42.060]   Well, all that's the point.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.740]   Which says like, they must be working
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.940]   on some crazy new thing.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.380]   Like, cardboard equals search, that's pretty good.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.820]   Search?
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:51.940]   She didn't she go from search?
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:52.580]   Oh, from search?
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.340]   Yeah, John Wiley.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.340]   John.
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.660]   He was the lead designer of Google search.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:57.660]   She designed her search.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:02.660]   She go from search, which is the crown jewel to cardboard.
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.060]   Right.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.700]   Must be coming to something big.
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:05.780]   And there's been what?
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.220]   A Reuters report that said they were working
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:10.620]   on a VR operating system?
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.460]   Because right now you--
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.900]   Wow.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.380]   Right now VR apps are really weird, like especially--
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.340]   They're angry apps, right?
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.940]   And with two windows.
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:19.420]   Right.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.340]   But like launching them and getting into that mode
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.420]   is super clunky.
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.140]   Like, you take the phone out and you start it
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.420]   and you stick it in the box and make sure everything's set up.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.580]   And the Oculus Rift is even worse.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:34.340]   It doesn't have like an RFID tag to launch.
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:35.540]   I thought it launched.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.740]   Yeah, they've worked on weird little launchers and stuff.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   Right.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.420]   This was supposedly like a whole operating system.
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.020]   Hey, F and done, Jason.
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.420]   How do you, when you wear-- he has Gear VR.
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:50.540]   How do you launch the Gear VR app before you put it
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.180]   in the helmet?
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.740]   When you connect it to the helmet?
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.660]   It has RFID.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:56.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.020]   It senses it.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.380]   It says, oh, I'm in VR.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:00.220]   Thank you.
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.980]   That's going to be obsolete tomorrow.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:02.580]   No, no, that's the--
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:03.580]   Oh, you got the S6 version.
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:04.260]   It's the S6 version.
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.260]   Oh, OK.
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:05.780]   Fancy.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:06.500]   Oh, you want to--
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.060]   Ooh, we're working with an edge?
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.060]   Ooh.
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:09.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.100]   Where's your end?
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:10.580]   Where's your end?
[00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.580]   Yeah, you want me to take the cover off.
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:13.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.620]   Why?
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.300]   It's not a-- there's nothing going on.
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.100]   Do you need the cover?
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.100]   Don't you need--
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.860]   What if I wear it like this?
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.980]   That looks great.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.380]   That's how the kids wear it these days.
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.660]   That's how the DJs wear it.
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:27.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:28.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.580]   But no, again, like the fingerprint stuff,
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:34.300]   this is a proprietary solution in Google kind of want to do.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:34.660]   They're on thing--
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.660]   You know, this is really comfortable.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.140]   --and get the full ecosystem on.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.260]   It's got nice--
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:38.260]   Really?
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:38.780]   --icups.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:39.780]   Really?
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:40.780]   It's--
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.460]   It's way less and smaller.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.660]   I mean, I just like it.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.180]   And it was 200 bucks, right?
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:45.700]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.220]   200?
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.860]   How much weight does the phone have?
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.140]   The phone's nothing.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.060]   I have an S6.
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.220]   I wonder if I should get this.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.820]   Why do you keep getting it?
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.860]   You should put it on without the phone, and that looks great.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.300]   Oh, does he have to be on one side?
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:02.540]   You have giant goggles.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.900]   Oh, I have to put it in the right--
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:04.780]   No, no, that's--
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.300]   Did I do it right?
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.300]   That's got to be right.
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.980]   It seems to have, like, attached.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:13.420]   Looks good with the S6 back in there.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.100]   Now what do I do?
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.940]   Oh!
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.140]   It's talking to me.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:18.540]   Welcome to virtual reality.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.860]   Have you used this yet?
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:20.500]   No, I just--
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.300]   Am I being the first person to use it?
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:22.820]   Yeah.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.060]   You shouldn't do that, Jason.
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.500]   You should get to do the--
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.100]   Hi, I've pulled up all the plastic.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.180]   What are you looking at?
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:28.980]   What are you looking at?
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.580]   Whoa, Leo, whoa, whoa.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.500]   Leo has gone to another world.
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.060]   So Leo, you saw it with the Gear VR.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.060]   Oh.
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.060]   That's--
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.060]   It's going to be illegal.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.180]   There's discussions about it from people like,
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.580]   I'm the guy who sits on a player with the Gear VR.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.580]   I feel bad--
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:50.940]   You're one of these?
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.460]   There's going to be 20 pictures of you on Twitter.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.300]   I feel bad for whoever sits next to you.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.700]   You'll probably be bumping into one.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:57.380]   Yeah, right.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:57.900]   With your head.
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:59.740]   You'll be off from your VR wonderland.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.620]   That's all?
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:02.460]   Well, plus the phone.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.420]   Because there's nothing in it.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.380]   You have to have a phone.
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:04.860]   Right.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.180]   It's a power you like in your S6.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.060]   Have you had any lag problems or anything like that?
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.060]   No.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.900]   I think they've licked those.
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:13.900]   It's not doing anything.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:14.900]   It's in configuration mode.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.500]   You've got to take glasses off, right?
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.500]   Oh, you doing it?
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.300]   That's a good thing to take.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.300]   Oh, that doesn't look at all dorky.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:21.820]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:24.660]   You look like Bender.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.140]   Doesn't he?
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.140]   It totally looks like Bender.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:28.500]   I don't look like that there.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.140]   Oh.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.740]   What does the outside world look like right now?
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:34.860]   It looks like a flywood seat.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.500]   It's all kinds of little images.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:37.300]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.220]   If you get the angle just right, it's giant eyeballs.
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.140]   I really want this now.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.740]   Leo, did you notice any sort of difference
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.620]   in the clarity of anything that you saw?
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.020]   It looked like it's still a little low resolution.
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.300]   Yeah, it's a few resolution.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.980]   It's a 2K screen or whatever.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:53.940]   So it's not going to be--
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:55.700]   It's like 720p.
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:56.660]   If you wear glasses--
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:57.980]   Isn't it?
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.980]   What does it do?
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.020]   It has a focus ring up here.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:01.540]   Oh, OK.
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:02.980]   So as long as you're--
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:03.820]   I'm going to--
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.580]   And the focus link on this one, Leo,
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:08.780]   is greater distance than the first one.
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:12.940]   Now, is this the innovator edition for Galaxy S6 Edge?
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.660]   I can have it tomorrow.
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:16.340]   Uh-oh.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:17.260]   Oh, do it, Leo.
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.340]   Go ahead.
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:19.500]   I got nothing to do.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.460]   I can just watch it through the whole Google I/O speech.
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.300]   I can watch this.
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.940]   Why don't you wait one day and see what comes out tomorrow?
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.780]   That's true.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.180]   So that it's not instantly--
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:27.700]   That was so stupid.
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.140]   --instantly--
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:29.140]   --instantly what I would do.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.300]   --instantly obsolete.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.700]   I got the V on.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.500]   No.
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.980]   Wait, do it so that they announce virtual reality stuff.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.060]   It's dependent on you.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.220]   Yeah, right.
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.060]   Take one for the TV.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.580]   Wash your car.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:41.580]   Where did you get yours?
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:42.540]   Did you get--
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:43.060]   Huh?
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:43.580]   Best buy.
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:44.180]   Best buy.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:46.020]   They haven't in stock?
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:46.540]   Well, they should--
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.860]   Impulse buy.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:48.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.980]   I see two to five weeks.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:50.540]   But you know, they--
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:51.220]   Oh, wow.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:52.060]   It's Amazon Prime.
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:55.500]   As soon as I log in, it'll be tomorrow.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.500]   So that lenses thing that reminded me of an out project
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.860]   I saw this week.
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:05.100]   This thing called smalleranupsidedown.com.
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:06.260]   And what he did was--
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.460]   it's part of the--
[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:24.600]   I was in residence thing at OrderS
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.300]   and things like that.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.020]   Smaller.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:27.340]   Really?
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:29.620]   Just looking through a pane of thing?
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:30.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.340]   It's a smalleranupsidedown.
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:35.500]   It's a big lump of resin that is a lens that
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.380]   does the effects to your heads that the--
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.220]   Oh, there we go.
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.780]   It's a fun house mirror.
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:43.380]   But it's a lens rather than a mirror, yes.
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.460]   Smalleranupsidedown.com.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:48.540]   So I thought that was funny.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.540]   But it was fascinating because--
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.500]   You're easily amused.
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.300]   When those things came out whenever it was.
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.020]   Five years ago, seven years ago.
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.700]   We will play with them for a couple of days
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.580]   and then use many more.
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.060]   It sold more max.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.700]   The photo booth sold more max.
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:05.380]   And any other app on the Mac.
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:06.380]   And such.
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:07.700]   Oh, I like that.
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.220]   But for me, it was this weird thing of like,
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.540]   I don't even play with that with my kids.
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:12.020]   It's a strange nostalgia.
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:13.220]   But creative physical.
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:16.020]   I thought that was quite a fun out project.
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:16.900]   So that's it.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:19.340]   But Jeff put those lenses on his face.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.780]   It reminded me of my eyes just got really big thing.
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.860]   By the way, are we eating the all about Android white chocolate
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.460]   macadamia cookies?
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.540]   No, you are the first to--
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:33.580]   Chris and the Macadamia Nut cookies on any put show.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.260]   Who brought those?
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.340]   I thank you, whoever.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.620]   This was a terrible idea.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:37.140]   Did you bring them?
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:37.740]   I'm tempted to.
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.180]   You don't air.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:38.740]   No.
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:39.460]   No, go ahead and eat.
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.060]   Who cares?
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:40.700]   Yes, I guess.
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:41.660]   I eat all the time.
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:42.940]   Professional and just a personal--
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.180]   You're a professional.
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.940]   All right.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.460]   What else?
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.380]   Google I/O.
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:52.580]   We're not-- this is going to be a five hour show.
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:55.860]   Smart home stuff.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.540]   Smart home?
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:57.260]   That's fun.
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.740]   So Google has-- who have they acquired?
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.580]   It's Nest and Dropcam.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.380]   And this company called Revolve, which
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.820]   made a smart home hub.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.900]   So kind of a thing that ties all of your--
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:07.420]   Like smart things.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:07.700]   Like smart things.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:07.980]   Like smart things.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.500]   Like smart things.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.020]   Yeah, smart things.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.100]   I don't know when you have sex.
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:12.900]   Sure.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.220]   Hey, I'd like to know when I have sex.
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.060]   If you wear the fifth date or whatever.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.460]   Please wake me and tell me I'm pleased.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.220]   Last night, really?
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.660]   I don't remember that.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.660]   OK.
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.820]   Just checking.
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.100]   Macadamia break weekly.
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.980]   I like the name.
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:31.100]   The new thing is Brillo, apparently.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:31.380]   Right.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.940]   The Internet of Things OS.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.780]   Now, is this related to Android, you think?
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.020]   Or is it--
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.100]   What the report said was that it's
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.020]   being made by the Android team.
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.780]   Why they did not just come out and say,
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.060]   it will be based on Android.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.900]   It is a little weird.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.260]   But I can't imagine it wouldn't be.
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.380]   But yeah, it's kind of like when Android started,
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.460]   where you have this--
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.020]   you have a bunch of OEMs making all this weird software
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.660]   that they're not used to making.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.260]   So you have a lot company having
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.780]   to make this Internet of Things software.
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.300]   And Google just wants to come in and say, here's our software.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.780]   It's free.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.940]   Use it as a standard.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:08.300]   Yes.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.420]   And everybody will use it to make your light bulb
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.900]   communicate with your dishwasher.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.580]   And that's kind of what Microsoft's doing.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:16.700]   They're giving away Windows 10 for Raspberry Pi.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.540]   They have two or three IoT SKUs for Windows.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.100]   Not that I would want to run Windows in an embedded environment.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.700]   I mean, it just doesn't-- it seems like a little--
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.260]   but there's, I guess--
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.620]   I mean, Android's overkill.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.620]   --every ATM machine in the US.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.740]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.180]   I mean, Android seems like overkill for this stuff, too,
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.340]   when you can do it all on a little microcontroller
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.580]   and whatever else.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.860]   So I mean, all we basically know is
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.380]   that Google's stripping down probably Android
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.340]   to run on little things.
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.180]   But we don't know why or why it's supposed to be better
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:46.700]   or anything.
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:49.060]   If I were John Chen-- if I were the CEO of BlackBerry,
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:54.060]   I would say I would be putting all my arrows behind Q&A
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.100]   and X for IoT.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:00.140]   They have a really nice real-time operating system they bought.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.660]   And you're absolutely right.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.780]   It needs to be something designed for embedded systems.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.020]   But then you need to make money if you're BlackBerry.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:09.380]   Right.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.580]   Where Google doesn't--
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.020]   Right.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.540]   Google will just make money other ways.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.420]   So that's how Android works.
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:15.740]   I have plenty of press and Larry's basing.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.220]   It's free.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:16.740]   It's free.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.580]   We have free.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.460]   We're good.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.460]   We have too much.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.700]   And then everyone else is just like, oh, they do it for us.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:22.700]   Too much.
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.700]   What else?
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.380]   This is-- I'm excited, actually.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.180]   We start our coverage 930--
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:35.940]   Civic 1230 Eastern Time, 1730 UTC.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.900]   Right after TNT.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.340]   I'll be doing TNT tomorrow.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:43.940]   And then Gina Trapani, Ron Richards, and Aaron Newcomb
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.700]   and I will cover Google I/O all 2 and 1/2 hours.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.420]   If we start at 930, we should be done by lunchtime.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:49.980]   Yep.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.820]   Good luck.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.420]   That's lunchtime is 2 in the afternoon.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.340]   All right.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.180]   And then there's millions of sessions to watch and go to.
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:58.700]   Right.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.740]   And everything else.
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:02.340]   Did we talk about privacy controls?
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.420]   Oh, who cares?
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.260]   Google controls my privacy.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.820]   That's the truth.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.380]   Well, but they have to respond to what people are very much
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.140]   concerned about.
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.740]   Bloomberg said they're going to give users greater control
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.700]   over what apps know what apps can do.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.460]   But I feel like the controls are pretty good.
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:23.460]   How are they going to get-- how would they be different?
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.020]   Well, it's all or nothing right now.
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.740]   They used to have app ops where you could go through and toggle.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.740]   I don't want Facebook to use my camera.
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:31.540]   I don't want it to be--
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.300]   Apple kind of does that.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.500]   You have to ask--
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.860]   it'll say in the manifest what it wants.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:40.380]   But then in order to get camera access or contact access,
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:40.980]   it will ask.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.460]   And you could say no, and then Apple will continue on.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.460]   Right.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:47.100]   If it's Instagram, it may not be very useful.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.980]   Where was Android when they did app ops?
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.700]   You said no, and the app crashed.
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.060]   So then they took app ops away.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:57.420]   And they're going to bring it back, apparently.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:59.100]   All right, we'll find-- you know what?
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.380]   Speculation is one thing.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.620]   It all happens tomorrow.
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.860]   If there were going to be a big surprise--
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.940]   You even you have got the scoupon.
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:10.780]   What would that be?
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.860]   What would it be?
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.780]   Google Now.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.020]   They can't do hardware.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.460]   I mean, it really bugs me that they're
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.140]   going to have a fingerprint API and know nothing that
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.420]   has a fingerprint reader.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.380]   I would love to see--
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.540]   Like an X6.2 or--
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.300]   Or some kind of--
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.180]   How about a little plug-in thing?
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.100]   A plugged in thing.
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.660]   Dog-gul for you.
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:29.660]   That's not good.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.380]   That's not good.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.380]   It's for developers.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.300]   They could test at least.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:32.900]   I guess.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.660]   Well, they might do that.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.260]   They might do that.
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.940]   The Chrometest would kind of be surprising.
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.860]   I mean, they've talked about it.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:41.980]   But I think we would hear more by now.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.500]   What would--
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.260]   how about an Amazon Echo?
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.980]   You know, I always-- I really thought Google let Amazon
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.620]   get away with Echo.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.260]   Because Google Now in an Amazon--
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:53.180]   watch him carefully.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:55.420]   Google Now.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:55.420]   Google Now.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.860]   Just see what his response is.
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.540]   Google Now in a hardware device that sits in your house
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.340]   and listens would be really cool.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.220]   I think we're--
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.180]   That would be a thing to do with the Chromecast, right?
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.500]   If you put a little microphone in the Chromecast
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.620]   so that it could pick up stuff--
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:08.940]   Behind your channel.
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.460]   --where you would--
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:09.940]   --to my TV.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.860]   --to my TV.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:11.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.140]   Hey.
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:12.640]   Hey.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.140]   Yo.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:13.660]   Yo.
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.500]   What I should say is I do.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.780]   I think we are do a smart home hub.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.820]   The expost is it.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.500]   That would be good.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.780]   So how do you talk to?
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.040]   Right.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.020]   Since they bought the SmartThings competitor.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:23.420]   And they have Nest.
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.180]   And they have all the smart home stuff that's not
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.180]   doing anything.
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.460]   Google Glass version 2.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:30.940]   They just rebooted and--
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.180]   I love that reaction.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.540]   I mean, they just rebooted.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:39.460]   And they have Tony Fidel in charge now.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:39.860]   You know what?
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.700]   I actually just realized.
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.300]   I have a museum of dead technology in my office.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.100]   I don't have to add the glass.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:45.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:46.660]   Next to the Newton.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.420]   Hey, Jason, when you're done with your glass,
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.540]   would you give it to me for my cabinet?
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.020]   You know, I still use it.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.020]   What?
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:54.820]   He does.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.500]   I use it-- the only thing I use it for is recording video
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.300]   when I want a first person kind of recorded experience.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.860]   Well, when we did that--
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.660]   --great ad for--
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.220]   --it's nice for that.
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:06.140]   --blue apron he was showing cooking.
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.740]   And it's so funny because you put the glass on recorded
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.620]   and you cooked a whole meal because you had both hands.
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:13.660]   And in order to do the same thing,
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:17.060]   we were doing a tip for the new screensavers
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.580]   and I was showing stir fry.
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.340]   Set up a camera, had to work around a tripod.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.860]   We didn't know if the angles were right.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.660]   It was a fixed angle.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.020]   Oh, it was such a pain.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:27.860]   It's the easiest thing.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.860]   It's the only thing on the world.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.300]   200 bucks?
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.180]   There's a hat match.
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:33.020]   Well, I do have a GoPro with a head mount.
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:33.900]   I could have done that.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.060]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:36.740]   It's not $1,400.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.820]   And it's not a Nexus--
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:38.180]   Look at this.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.220]   It's not a Galaxy Nexus camera.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.140]   The quality's good, though.
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:41.180]   Look at this.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.180]   Sort of.
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.260]   It's a little green.
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:45.060]   That's a camera from a 2011 smartphone.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.060]   Yeah, right.
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.220]   The Galaxy Nexus, basically.
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.700]   But hey, I had it on me.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.340]   And all I had to do was make sure it was charged.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.540]   It's camera jiggles.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.100]   Why didn't I think of the GoPro?
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:57.020]   I have the height mount and everything.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.300]   What was I thinking?
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.420]   You bought into the hype.
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.260]   I bought into the hype?
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:02.020]   Well, that's what Julio's all about.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.580]   I am the hype.
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.340]   You'll buy any hype design.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.700]   There was a time when flip cams were a big deal.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.180]   Remember that?
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.620]   Remember those?
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:10.780]   And then everybody had one.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:11.780]   And their phones.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:12.780]   So yeah.
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:13.780]   Easy to buy.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.540]   Matt cuts.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.780]   He's got to be--
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:20.500]   I think he's going to be the first person in the Mars or something.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.300]   He's working on something super secret.
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:22.980]   He's got to be.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.940]   There was an article in-- in fact, it mentioned him a few months ago
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:29.260]   saying Google puts people on the beach because they keep the amount
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.860]   of competitors' hands.
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.540]   And they just say, enjoy, relax.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.340]   And if you think of something you want to do, OK?
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.220]   But you don't have to do anything.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.540]   I feel like that's what Matt's doing.
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:38.740]   I know.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.300]   I think it is.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.140]   And I can see how I always said.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:45.500]   But my line about Matt is always that you would think he'd
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.260]   be the meanest person on Earth.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.340]   But he's the nicest person on Earth.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.220]   We love Matt.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.740]   And Matt, if the next thing is like doing podcasts,
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.140]   you know where your friends are.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.460]   That are also what you.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:01.460]   Search Engine Land says that there is a new head of a search
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.780]   spam at Google, which was Matt's job.
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:12.460]   So Google has not named that person because he's not public
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:13.140]   like Matt was.
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:15.460]   Matt was really about--
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.220]   he did the webmaster videos and all that great stuff.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.940]   He appeared here all the time.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:22.620]   So you're going to have just rulings come down
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.980]   from anonymous Google web spam first.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.740]   Hey, if I were them, I would do that.
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:27.620]   Wouldn't you?
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.180]   You don't want to be the known as the guy.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.540]   Be hounded by SEO after all day.
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.460]   You're going down the mall.
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.460]   You're outside hot topic.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:39.420]   And somebody says, hey, you're Matt Cuts, aren't you?
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:40.340]   That would not be good.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.460]   It's actually Matt Cuts, and he's just tired of that.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.220]   You know, that's the best way to go.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.300]   It's still Matt Cuts.
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.540]   He just doesn't want you to know.
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:50.740]   That's how it wouldn't be surprised.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.420]   That's brilliant.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:56.740]   Google has new head of web spam.
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:00.020]   And by the way, Danny Sullivan, if anybody knows, it's Danny,
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.140]   but won't be the new Matt Cuts.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.300]   So Matt Cuts still gets to be the old Matt Cuts.
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.180]   Google's looking for a new head of PR.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.460]   Maybe it should be Matt.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.860]   Happy, great for that.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.620]   So Matt is one of the first 100 Googlers, maybe one of the first 10.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.300]   Was that so?
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.660]   Yeah, he was very early on.
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:20.260]   He told us, I've forgotten.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.180]   I'll show you his quite first time.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:21.940]   He was very early.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.060]   He was very early.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:23.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:27.300]   So he probably doesn't have to do much.
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:30.020]   He probably just hang out.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.500]   Yeah, in Silicon Valley, they do that.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.340]   Remember the guy Bighead?
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:36.220]   He's beached at Holi.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.940]   He has a place up on the roof where the other people are beached at Holi.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:41.700]   So speaking of roofs--
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.140]   Roofs.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.380]   --on the roof.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.380]   I went to Facebook.
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.180]   That was yesterday.
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.100]   How was that?
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:47.580]   It was great.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:48.420]   It was fascinating.
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:50.780]   I'm talking with some people there just about stuff that I'd--
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.860]   walkie stuff I do, but I got to walk the roof.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:55.500]   The garden roof for the good place.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.540]   Yeah, it's quite amazing.
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.040]   Oh.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.180]   It's-- the building is weird because, as you know, when you go in--
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.500]   It's like paint stripping.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.820]   First, it's a parking lot.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.580]   It's nothing but a parking lot on the first level.
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.940]   So it's a really kind of ugly thing.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:07.440]   What?
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:07.940]   It's a very par--
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.020]   That's very hideous.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.700]   And then you go up plywood.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.780]   And what they said was, they purposely
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.020]   made it look incredibly unfinished,
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.180]   because that's what Facebook is.
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.180]   Facebook is always learning and changing.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.220]   And so it's nice.
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.460]   It's very nice.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:24.420]   And then the roof is just the mouth of dirt.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.860]   They have this much soil.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.100]   But it's a green building.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.900]   It's probably part of the lead certification.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.420]   But it's like that much.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:31.700]   They were digging a hole for a treasure.
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.260]   Something that was quite a dig.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.820]   But that's going to be a lot of weight.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:35.780]   It's lovely to walk.
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:36.300]   Has that?
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:36.940]   Ford does.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.180]   And the Rouge plant.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:41.340]   They're growing the fibers they use in the seats.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.260]   No.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:47.180]   Nine acres criss-crossed with trails.
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:48.140]   Did you take a walk?
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:48.820]   Yeah, I walked.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.140]   I was meeting with somebody.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:51.620]   And he said, well, I want to walk.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.220]   Well, we meet.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.820]   So we went around the roof.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:54.340]   It was great.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:55.100]   So I see what you're saying.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.420]   This looks like a crappy Silicon Valley apartment
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.700]   complex with the garage.
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:01.220]   Yeah, below, which is on the first level.
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.580]   So then you go up a stairway.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.220]   And it's a five by eight by raw plywood.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:06.820]   And you get up.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.580]   And it's even roarer than this.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.980]   Roar, roar, roar, roar.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.060]   Roar, roar.
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.060]   Roar, roar.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:18.380]   So the beams are all still bare and have the chalk marks on them
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.180]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:21.900]   But it's very nice space.
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.900]   That is so beautiful.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.900]   They don't have a golf course up there.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.980]   Absolutely, they're a putting range.
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.500]   They should.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.260]   They really should.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:27.860]   They should.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.900]   They're in the bed there.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.980]   Little sand trap.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.900]   If Google-- I mean, Facebook were a real company, they would.
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:37.460]   But because they're hip, they don't play golf.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.100]   They probably have an ultimate Frisbee course.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.860]   Well, you know, in the old days, when Mark wanted to hire you,
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:43.780]   he'd take a walk.
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.220]   Take a walk?
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:44.580]   Take a walk.
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:45.380]   So now I guess he has to--
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.020]   That's Steve Jobs thing.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:52.580]   We're actually looking at using Facebook's parse, which
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.060]   we keep hearing about every year at FA.
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.300]   They bought them a couple of years ago.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.020]   But we're trying to figure out a way with our apps,
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:03.620]   because we're going to do new apps, ones and new site launches,
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.260]   that you could use the app on, say, your iPad,
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:09.220]   and then pick up your S6, and it would leave off
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:10.700]   where you left off.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:13.660]   But in order to do that, you'd have to have an account,
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.580]   which is a good thing.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.820]   Marche does this for free for the first million users.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.340]   Like Facebook just says, yeah, whatever.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.620]   So I think we might do that.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.300]   But then your account is actually a Facebook account.
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:23.860]   So you would say--
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:24.860]   Well, I asked about that.
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:27.340]   You could sign up with Twitter or Facebook, or have a stand
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.620]   alone.
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:29.220]   And I asked.
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.020]   I said, this is his shared data with Facebook.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.420]   He said, no.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:32.920]   Wow.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.020]   So you're right, though, Kevin.
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.660]   I want to look into that, because I know our audience doesn't
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.980]   want to be channeled into that ecosystem.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.380]   But that would give you notifications, too.
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.300]   So whereas at Google, you go to a place
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.060]   to pick up the wires and things you need.
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:53.580]   And Facebook, they have vending machines for it.
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.300]   Wait, I need an ethernet cable.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.380]   Let me run down to the thing.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:56.820]   Yeah, well, yeah.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.060]   Or they have phone covers or things.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:58.460]   I didn't stare at it.
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.460]   When you're eating USB-C function.
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.100]   They have a model.
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.660]   I think that's those two.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:03.100]   They do?
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.740]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.500]   I wasn't allowed in that room, I guess.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.020]   They have a model of the whole building.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.060]   The model itself is just amazing.
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:14.380]   It's phenomenal.
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.580]   Did you meet with Mark?
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:16.420]   No, but I saw him.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.700]   So he's still in a fishbowl office.
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.660]   So I walked by and we waved to each other.
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:23.500]   Did it look like the office in the social network?
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.420]   I can't remember what they were.
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:25.580]   Were he fired at Wardo's savoring?
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:26.500]   No, no.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:30.540]   The office he had in Palo Alto was the same thing.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.180]   It was a three-sided fishbowl.
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.180]   And so I walked by.
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:37.780]   As soon as opulent as apples, new headquarters, or even--
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.700]   I would not call it opulent at all.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.700]   No, it's interesting.
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:41.700]   No, it's good for them.
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.820]   It sends a message that says--
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:44.220]   Break things.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.220]   --break things.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.140]   Yeah, it says break things, exactly.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.780]   I like that, actually.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:52.060]   I think it's risky.
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:56.100]   When a company-- and it's always been said that when the company
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.220]   builds its massive corporate landmark headquarters,
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.900]   that's the first sign it's over.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.060]   It's the beginning of the end.
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.340]   It's catty corner from one hacker away from the most recent headquarters.
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:07.140]   Good.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:07.660]   And--
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.540]   Did they keep it?
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:09.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.700]   They're just growing.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:11.900]   Yeah, this is building 20.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:12.860]   So it's not like building one.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.860]   Oh, my god.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.660]   Building 20.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.200]   Yeah, I think it was the rest where they moved down there,
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.160]   so they could expand it to the swamp, wasn't it?
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:19.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:20.160]   Just like--
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160]   Boy, there's swamp there.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.160]   It's lots of--
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:22.680]   Hey, let's take a break.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.560]   When we come back, we've got more.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.840]   Kevin Marks is here.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:30.600]   It's always great to have the Tom O'Lurr himself, Mr. Indie Web.
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.000]   That's kind of your now, Mr. Indie Web.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.600]   Indiewebcamp.com.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.960]   Thank you for keeping and fighting the good fight.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.160]   I want to tell you what I want to do when we come back.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.160]   OK.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.000]   This has to be--
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.960]   I will alert the Indie Web for--
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.160]   Please alert the team.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.400]   Put up the bad signal, Jeff Jarvis, in the studio,
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.560]   in person, love having you.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.360]   Not flesh.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.280]   Not flesh, isn't it?
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.160]   You always wear black?
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:55.720]   That's like it.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.680]   I pretty much do now.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.360]   I didn't realize it.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.640]   Especially when I travel.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.080]   It makes it a lot easier.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:00.580]   Sure.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.600]   No mixing and matching.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.800]   No, so I'm too old to do the Mark Zuckerberg Gray T-shirt.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.960]   No, no, no.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:06.460]   I like it.
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.160]   It's a suit.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.040]   It's a Johnny Cash.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:08.600]   Johnny Cash.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.680]   The only problem is black.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:10.200]   You only probably go to that one.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.600]   Well, what the hell?
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.400]   Johnny had no hair.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.760]   No, he did.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.960]   Anyway, Jeff is a professor of journalism at CUNY City
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.040]   University of New York.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.120]   An esteemed colleague, he also is the author of many, many,
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.600]   many great books.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.040]   Gutenberg, the Geek, the latest Geeks bearing gifts.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:29.160]   And you could find his blog at buzzmachine.com.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.960]   And we're really pleased to have-- for the first time
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.520]   on this show, Ron, a Mario of a Mario.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.640]   A Mario, yes.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.000]   Not a Mario of Oz Technica Doc.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.560]   As long as you can Google it.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:41.840]   We're good.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.640]   R-O-N-A-M-A-D-E-O.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.240]   And the Twitter is the same.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.920]   Nice to have you.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.560]   You must come back virtually from Jersey.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.640]   Any time.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.360]   Anybody lives in South Jersey, you could be on this show.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:54.880]   OK.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.280]   What's wrong with the North?
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.800]   What?
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.640]   Well, that's OK.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.640]   North Jersey is the suburb of New York, right?
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.320]   Or South Jersey.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.880]   No, it's just old land.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.760]   Where's T-neck?
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.680]   According to who?
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.840]   According to someone from South Jersey, no.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.240]   And I grew up in--
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.240]   OK, Springsteen is from South Jersey, though, right?
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:15.640]   Oh, no.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.080]   No, it's Beshore, which is Beshore.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.600]   Beshore, man, I can't keep up.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.160]   I grew up in South Jersey part time in Cinevinson.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:28.040]   I was listening to Jungle Run at 192 kilobits per second night
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.120]   at 24% yesterday.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.440]   That sounded so good.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.000]   I felt like I was in Jersey.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.840]   I could smell the boardwalk.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.120]   And the taffy.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.800]   But there's a whole farm area.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.600]   People think Jersey--
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:41.400]   Factories they think--
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.040]   I live out in what--
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:44.880]   It's beautiful farmland.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:45.880]   It's beautiful.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.400]   It's beautiful state.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.200]   The garden state.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:47.960]   That's South Jersey.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.000]   There's like a solid line.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:49.480]   That's what I thought.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.600]   Well, South Jersey is all pine trees.
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.600]   There's a solid line where it becomes all factories immediately.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.240]   That's the pine barons are out there.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.120]   That was the greatest--
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.720]   the pine barons.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:00.760]   Mr. TV coke.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.680]   Yes, right.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.760]   Greatest episode of the Sopranos.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.680]   We're poly walnuts.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.760]   Stuck in the pine barons.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.480]   Stuck in the pine barons.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.560]   In a track suit.
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.680]   I just like saying, poly walnuts.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.440]   Our show today brought to you by those great folks
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.120]   at zipprecruiter.com, a zip recruiter.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.400]   You can post to 100 plus, 100 plus job sites
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   with the click of the mouse.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.880]   And this is why you want to do this.
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:29.880]   If you're an employer, maybe you just have a small business
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.680]   and you're looking for somebody-- for instance,
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.160]   we are looking--
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:37.960]   I need a personal assistant to hang out my socks.
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:38.800]   So--
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:39.360]   Me too.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.360]   Yeah, don't you?
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.320]   Everybody.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.840]   So you could go to one or two job sites,
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.080]   but wouldn't it be cool if you just went to zipprecruiter.com
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.880]   and posted everywhere, 100 plus job boards,
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.520]   Twitter too, Facebook, Craigslist everywhere.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.920]   And you might say, well, but no, Leo,
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.160]   because I don't want all of those people calling me.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:17:59.760]   I'm emailing me.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:00.520]   No, they don't.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.120]   That's the beauty part.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.560]   Their applications, their responses
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.600]   come to you in the zipprecruiter interface.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:12.440]   So you can quickly screen and find the right candidate.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.200]   In fact, you might not even have to worry about that,
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.320]   because they have over 4 million current resumes
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.280]   in their database.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.520]   So you put a job listing up there.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:24.440]   You could literally, within a second, get 1,000 candidates
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.680]   that you can quickly screen rate and hire the right one fast.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:28.400]   Just post once.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.920]   And with the 24 hours, you'll watch those candidates roll in.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.320]   It's been used by over 400,000 businesses, including Twit.

[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.680]   Really.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.000]   Make it easy.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.640]   Try it free for four days.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   zipprecruiter.com/twigzipprecruiter.com/twig.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.320]   We thank them so much.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.600]   They're supportive of this week in Google.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.920]   The creepy line has been crossed.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.040]   Uh oh.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:00.840]   Uh oh.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.520]   I got to be there.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.320]   Google has patented patents.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.680]   I don't like to do these stories, because as everybody knows,
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.360]   patents have nothing to do with products.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.360]   It's just the lawyers.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.280]   And then the writers read way too much of them.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:20.680]   But they have patented a way to predict what you like by accent.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.400]   And the story says that this is offensive.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.320]   Why is it offensive?
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.480]   If you say to me.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.680]   You're profiling by--
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.680]   Profiling.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.960]   No, it's not offensive at all.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.000]   No, it's not.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.560]   I would have liked a nice arrest around for tonight.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:37.600]   I want to go to Amadeus.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.040]   They have a very good pasta.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.160]   That's where you would want to go, though, man.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.640]   Like the Italians would know where the good pasta was.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.480]   That's right.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.040]   And if you talk like a truck driver,
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.040]   you're going to get the best truck step day.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.400]   Right.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.760]   I doubt very much this is an actual product.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.960]   But it's kind of a fun thing.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.480]   The patent implies that Germans prefer German food.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.760]   I think that's safe.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.880]   I think so too.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.680]   Fried food, at least.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.280]   Is music coming out of you?
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.040]   It's not me.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.720]   I think it's that computer over there.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.360]   Oh, careful.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.720]   That guy's OK.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:16.240]   That's what he's following.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:16.800]   He came in.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.960]   So I'm not imagining it.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.000]   You're like a My Fair Lady service,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.160]   where you have to teach people to give different answers
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:22.760]   to their search results.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:24.080]   I govna.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.080]   I like Amade Pie.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.520]   Ow.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.120]   How about a grammar, a grammar researcher,
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.720]   if you don't use whom properly, we won't serve you.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:33.800]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.800]   I like that.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.920]   I know if you use whom properly,
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.080]   they mark up the price a bit.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.880]   Oh, Kevin, did you see John Oliver?
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.480]   Not John Oliver's.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.840]   Bill Maher's British accent.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.240]   Why does everybody have a British accent routine?
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:49.760]   No.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.920]   Oh.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.000]   Oh, brilliant.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:52.520]   Absolutely.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.840]   Was this on his TV show?
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.120]   Quickly, search.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.440]   I've obviously used this assumption.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.400]   There's one British accent.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.400]   Oh, God, there's so many.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.720]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:05.040]   OK.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.720]   You've got the Dick Van Dyke, Mary Poppins accent.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:09.320]   OK.
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.920]   You've got-- look up Brits for brains.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.880]   Brits for brains.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.320]   You know what I like is all of the--
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.960]   it's changed in the '50s.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:22.720]   But prior to the method acting, every actor in Hollywood
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.320]   had a faint British accent.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:24.800]   Oh, so sorry.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.320]   Look up Bill Maher, Brits for brains.
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:28.720]   You got it?
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.200]   OK.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.640]   Let's watch the luck of the iris.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.440]   Oh, that-- we sure jumped that.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.520]   Someone has to tell me why Americans
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.680]   don't take anything seriously unless it's delivered
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:43.840]   with a British accent.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.040]   There you go, killer ones.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.840]   Why in movies, even ones where the actors are American--
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:48.840]   The people who are missing Brits.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.800]   --playing people who are not British,
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.400]   they still put on a British accent.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.200]   It's true.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.840]   Here's Brad Pitt as a kiddies.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.560]   Almondance.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.400]   My brothers are the sword.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.520]   My brothers are the sword.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.480]   He's from the Midwest.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.120]   And he's a Greek.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.000]   Ancient Greeks were not.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.680]   But neither were they from Notting Hill.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.840]   So why does he have to say sword?
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.960]   Sword.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.840]   Why is sword more serious than sword?
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:20.600]   Here's Marlon Brando as Superman's dad.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.240]   All that I have, all that I've learned, everything I feel.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.320]   Everything I feel.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.160]   Brando, the greatest actor ever.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.160]   You mean, even he can't talk American?
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.120]   Did biblical people have British accents?
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.720]   Like Jennifer Connolly?
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:35.720]   This is Jo-Rella.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:36.720]   He's not from America.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720]   Yeah, Jo-Rella's from Krypton.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:45.200]   Her 600-year-old husband is putting
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.480]   3 million animals on a houseboat.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.200]   But she's using a British accent because she doesn't
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.120]   want to sound silly.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.440]   It's true.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.680]   So there you go.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.680]   That's why we have Kevin Marks on the show.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.400]   That's why it makes us sound smarter.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.600]   Why does he make us sound stupid next to Harry?
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.200]   It's a problem.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.640]   Yeah, Kevin.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.880]   Periscope has come to Android.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.400]   Seth.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.240]   At last.
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:10.720]   At last.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.440]   I want to jump before the show.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.880]   Just before the show.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.920]   Are you a pair-- well, Muir cat's been out for a while
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.480]   on Android.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.040]   I didn't do either.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.040]   [SQUEALING]
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.520]   So we could simulcast on Periscope right now?
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.120]   I don't know what I think of these live streaming apps.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:31.040]   Of course, I spent a lot of money, time, and effort
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.960]   creating an entire live streaming studio.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.520]   Now you're ahead of the Try to get on sale
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:36.960]   to get rid of live streaming.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.920]   At least my video is sideways.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:44.200]   That's one of Mary Meeker's points in her thing today,
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.080]   is the rise of vertical video.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.560]   Well, thank you, Mary Meeker.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.680]   She is a futurist, isn't she?
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.640]   So she does this every year, right?
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:59.280]   She just dropped the slide bomb at recode.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.440]   Oh, let's go look.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.200]   It is a slide bomb, too, because she's not
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.640]   notorious for aesthetics.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.680]   So Mary Meeker's slide share 2015.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:11.200]   She is what?
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.520]   She's an analyst, right?
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.760]   A stock analyst?
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.280]   But she's famous--
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.280]   She's a VC app.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.560]   She's a VC, OK.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:25.240]   She's famous because she's gotten things right in the past.
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.560]   Right?
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.720]   Are you periscoping?
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:29.960]   We're already on the internet.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.280]   I know how much your routine is used, so I thought I'd do it.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.280]   It doesn't.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.280]   So that was free.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.200]   That was free, you say.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.440]   You just downloaded it and happened.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:37.280]   So how do I stop the--
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.680]   No, no, continue.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:41.920]   Give Jeff Hartz.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.520]   I'm trying to have a slide now, hang on.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.760]   Here it is.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:45.520]   Here it is.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.360]   Internet trends 2015.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.120]   She gave it a code yesterday.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:51.760]   Outline.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.240]   Internet.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.440]   2/3 of a generation in.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440]   Key Internet trends.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.600]   So slide 22.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.640]   Slide 22.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.760]   Should I jump?
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.080]   Lots of people using the internet.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.560]   A lot of them are mobile.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:04.240]   Companies--
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.200]   You want to have information.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.360]   --rich.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.640]   Actually, you can do this.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.840]   We can do this as a blip, but this is great.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.480]   Internet-- oh, here's the evolution of content discovery,
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.040]   the VCR 1975.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.280]   Streaming Radio 2012.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.760]   Now it's Chromecast.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.520]   Sector economy has arrived.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.240]   The internet is 100% consumer, but only 10% policy thinking.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.040]   Key Internet trends.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.200]   Lots of math.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.400]   Smart throne subscriptions.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.040]   A lot, a lot.
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.800]   Up, up, up.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.360]   Average GDP per capita in five countries
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:44.200]   with greater than 50 million population, 44,000 in the countries
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.720]   with--
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720]   I don't know what that means.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.160]   You do marry me, her slideshow and--
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.160]   It's like people in developing world
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.320]   have less money than developed world.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.160]   Yeah, people have less money in the third world.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.720]   OK, time spent per adult user per day with digital media
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.760]   in the USA is going up.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.200]   This is a good one for you, there you go.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.040]   Ma'am, mobile is a big slice of that going up, too.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.200]   But you know what's not going up?
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.680]   Other connected devices.
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:12.160]   Advertising and monetization equals something.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.720]   Time spent-- oh, here we go.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.720]   This is what I like.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.160]   In media versus percent of advertising spending--
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.160]   Dom advertising.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.160]   As much as the revenue, yeah.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.160]   Well, she keeps saying this is John,
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.160]   opportunity mobile advertising, and it never appears.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.120]   She's had the same slide pretty much for like,
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.120]   four years now.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.120]   Well, that makes it simpler.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.720]   She doesn't have to make a new slide.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.440]   She is terrible at slides.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.960]   I just want to tell you, these are the worst.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.360]   Are we at 22 yet?
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.360]   Is that the one?
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.360]   No.
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.360]   No.
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.360]   No things.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.360]   Vendors brands.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.360]   Consumers should be excited about--
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:43.360]   Ah, this is stuff for a lot.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.560]   Pinterest is adding cinematic pins.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.760]   He's not very exciting these ones.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.760]   This is like, advertisers should be excited about.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:53.640]   Google local inventory ad, Facebook carousel ad, five second video ads.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.480]   Buy buttons on Twitter, Facebook, and Google.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.960]   We mentioned that that Google is going to put buy buttons in their ads.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.960]   I'm not excited.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.760]   Something funny happened on the way to the small screen.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.240]   She got a little joke in video then.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.000]   Here's the vertical video slide you mentioned, video now.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.480]   The next one is like, percentage of it is vertical or something.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.800]   So I'm not sure-- is this time spent on something--
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.920]   I can just buy more into it.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:16.920]   Wow.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:21.920]   Funny, given this woman is dedicated to a misuse of bar charts.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.520]   No, that's not a bad bar chart.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.760]   This is stacked bar chart.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.120]   I don't like stacked bar charts.
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.120]   Because then you have to kind of figure out--
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.000]   It's 29% of videos wrong.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   That's the point.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.760]   I just think when it's something like this, where the top one is moving the wrong.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.760]   All right.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:34.760]   Top one's moving.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:38.480]   The horizontal screens are losing ground to vertical screens.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.520]   So this is what these analyst people do on there.
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.040]   2010 was, oh, you idiot.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040]   You're holding it wrong.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.040]   Right.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.920]   2015 is, this is the new way to hold it.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.760]   This is the future.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.520]   I've been saying that for a long time.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.000]   So the idiot column is growing.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.840]   So get the next slide here.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.720]   Full screen vertical video ads on snap, crap, chat.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.080]   Nine times higher competition completion rate versus horizontal.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.600]   That's the point that made me because the butt--
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.840]   I can never work out of--
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.360]   Right.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360]   --because it makes anything on the side.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   I think you quit.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.560]   Because it's the entire screen.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.080]   Right.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.080]   Just the entire screen.
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.160]   If with the other one, there's a back part.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.120]   Interesting that that makes some sense to me.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.200]   And it's something that's used to be seeing the periscope things as well.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.840]   It's like, oh, if your screen's that way around,
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.240]   most well fill it up with video, too.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.720]   Even if it means you're looking through a pillar.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.160]   Reimagining continues.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.360]   Forget Enterprise.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.720]   Enterprise software used to be about making existing work more efficient.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.840]   Now the opportunity for software is to transform the work itself.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.920]   That's completely meaningless.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:34.760]   Cue the entry.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:38.360]   It's the most boring tweet of the year.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.440]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.440]   Oh, lord.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:42.920]   It's pretty quiet.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:43.280]   Where do you go?
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:43.840]   Anyway.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.560]   Look at-- here we go.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.120]   This is the blip for-- oh, no.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.920]   Slide share can't keep up.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.480]   I'm going too fast.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:54.360]   Facebook messaging, Snapchat, one user, another user, context identity,
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.400]   more up-close and personal, select top countries for mobile subscriptions.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.840]   Messaging plus notification equals a lot of text.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.400]   Reimagining content, Pinterest growth, music, holiday sports.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.200]   It's better than Google Zeitgeist.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:06.560]   You know what?
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.280]   There's still 137 to go.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.280]   Oh, geez.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.280]   Let me just skip.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.280]   66.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.280]   Get to 66.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.480]   60% paid by the slide.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:19.760]   Well, you know what?
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.760]   People listen to her because she--
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.200]   Well, not her.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:29.560]   --users generating their content, a la periscope, Mirkat, are recreating their internet.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.640]   What the hell does that mean?
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.000]   No, no, I understand that.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.600]   In other words--
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.960]   It's IndieWeb.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.640]   No, but it's what--
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.680]   I see his mind is kissing, I think, to it.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:42.960]   It's basically saying that people are reinventing their image now.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.480]   And--
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.640]   We've been doing that for the last 10 years.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.800]   It's what Joseph--
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.720]   It was on the cover of Time, wasn't it?
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:49.720]   Yeah, Bloggs.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:50.720]   You think it was the person of the year.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.000]   It was all us.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.120]   What's the power of myth?
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.680]   Joseph Campbell?
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.520]   Campbell.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:59.760]   Said, if you don't like the dominant culture, make your own.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.840]   It's what Keeks have been doing since day one.
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.880]   Users are recreating the internet.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.320]   Reimagining internet usage.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.680]   12 to 24-year-olds remain trend setting.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.200]   No.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:11.880]   I hate that.
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.560]   Social media usage among American Yoot.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.120]   Facebook number one with Yoot.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.560]   Then Instagram, also Facebook.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:20.240]   I think the rumors of Facebook's monies.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:20.640]   Thank you.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:27.240]   What's a Yoot?
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.920]   Millennial smart phone behavior.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.000]   My smartphone never leaves my side.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.320]   Night or day 87%.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.080]   It only is like, I've got six smartphones.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.520]   I never leave my side.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.280]   You know, it's funny.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:41.320]   Michael, our 12-year-old came in the room yesterday in my office
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:44.560]   and said, how many phones do you have?
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.360]   And he said, there's five phones here.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.840]   I said, yeah, I got two in my pocket.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:51.440]   True.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:52.800]   And you never call anybody.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.880]   No, I hate the phone.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.720]   When I wake up, the first thing I do is reach for my smartphone.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:57.920]   Smart phone.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.680]   80%.
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.880]   I spend more than two hours a day using my smartphone.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:02.760]   78%.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:03.680]   We would all be in this.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.320]   Oh, god, yeah.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.000]   Oh, of course.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.200]   Sure, the alarm goes off.
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:07.760]   So you're going to turn your phone off.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.560]   In the next five years, I believe everything
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.520]   will be done on mobile devices.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.040]   Everything.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.640]   Everything.
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:14.800]   60%.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.080]   Only 5% disagree.
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.960]   Redefining phone sex.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.640]   Oh, interesting.
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:22.600]   Everything.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:26.720]   Smart phone camera users, almost half, at least once a day.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.840]   To post on social media, 76%.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.120]   Every other day, 22%.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:33.960]   Pictures of things to do later is the number two.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.760]   Pay bills, 21%.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.240]   We're not even halfway through this thing.
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.440]   This is just-- they don't actually
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:41.200]   have to communicate with other people about stuff.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:41.880]   You'll notice that.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.760]   No, look at these.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.720]   This is millennial smart-- but these are smart.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.560]   This is the camera.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.720]   But one of my big use cases is sending a picture of something
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.160]   to my wife saying, is this the thing you wanted or vice
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:52.660]   versa?
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:53.760]   Her saying, have you seen this thing?
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.080]   Actually, taking photographs of stuff.
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.120]   Oh, we do that all the time.
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.720]   And they don't have a category for that.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.920]   So I think they didn't ask the question.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:01.420]   Right.
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.680]   Well, maybe that summed up to post a picture.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.120]   This is Periscope.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.280]   Is that your Periscope?
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.000]   Re-imagining getting what you want when you want it.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.360]   If it's 197 slides, there's probably
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.040]   a picture of every single app ever made.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.040]   I know.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:13.800]   There's someone.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.960]   I can't wait to get to the spoiler.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:16.760]   Well, let's do--
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.800]   Is it like a too long, dinnery slide?
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.680]   Key design concept, too long to read.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:21.480]   Look at all the text.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:22.320]   There's a bunch of drones--
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.160]   Stuff coming, hang on.
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.680]   Drones.
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.720]   Mary Maker discovers drones.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.720]   Drones.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.320]   Does she work on this all year?
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.080]   More drone thoughts.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:36.720]   Drone is driving a new way of big data collection
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:37.520]   and analysis.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.520]   That's interesting.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.480]   True.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.600]   Consumer commercial drone development ranking countries
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.680]   by government accommodation.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:48.120]   I don't even see the US on this list.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.600]   That's another slide, Leo.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.560]   It is second slide.
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.240]   Just add a slide.
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.080]   Second slide.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.000]   Oh, appendix.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.500]   OK.
[01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:53.840]   So appendix--
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.960]   We can skip that already.
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:55.960]   You have my now.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.400]   Oh, my god.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.240]   Well, there you go.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.000]   Here's the numbers.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.560]   Here's what counts.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.960]   Well, actually, look at that, India.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.800]   That's important.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.200]   In 2014, 198 million internet users--
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.760]   Unboiled, huh?
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:14.800]   In China, it's 632, but more than 45% penetration.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.360]   So the real growth market here is India--
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.560]   India is going to be a big time.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.240]   And we've mentioned that before.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:25.640]   And then Nigeria, we talked about Empesa on a Twitter
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:28.080]   on Sunday, Nigeria, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Mexico.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:34.000]   And India, by the way, only 16% of the population has internet.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.440]   So you have huge--
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.640]   So the lack of sense of government--
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:39.040]   Wow.
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:39.840]   Bangladesh--
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.560]   Well, I can change those cultures.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.880]   That's infrastructure, right?
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:45.360]   The lack of wire.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360]   Well, there you go.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, everything you need to know about 2016.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.240]   I'm so informed.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:52.240]   The future is here.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.840]   The future is now.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.680]   OK.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.680]   We can wrap this up.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:02.840]   We haven't talked about a thing in the rundown.
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:03.360]   Which is fine.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.000]   What do you want to talk about?
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:04.520]   Pick something.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:04.520]   I don't know.
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.040]   Is there anything here?
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.360]   I'm not sure there is.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:11.040]   I'm sad Mandriva is gone bankrupt, gone belly up.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.000]   Mandriva was the--
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.360]   the Distro-Mandrake Distro of Linux
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.240]   that we installed most often on the screen savers many moons ago.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.560]   It was the easiest to install.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.720]   It came to a world where Slackware was the dominant Linux
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:29.560]   distribution and impossible to install.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:35.080]   And Mandrake came along and really made it easy.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.280]   Red Hat came after.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.720]   I think Mandrake-- maybe you remember Kevin,
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:42.920]   a version of Red Hat chat room would remember.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.240]   I don't remember.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.280]   They sold Mandrake at Walmart, says Doug PDX.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.000]   I remember that.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.920]   You could go to Staples and get a Mandrake box.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:52.640]   That's right.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:53.840]   I forgot that.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.560]   I forgot what the memory is.
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.920]   Well, I think there's--
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.200]   basically, if you're in the market for that,
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.120]   you basically just put a Chromebook these days.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.360]   Now, that's the thing.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.560]   The Linux on the desktop is here.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.840]   It's just that it's Linux on the desktop,
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.680]   and it's on the phone.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.160]   It won.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.320]   And it's not been a bunch of stuff you can't--
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:09.320]   Right.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.520]   It won, but you don't know.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.560]   Right.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.680]   And to some extent, it won because it stopped
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.120]   sort of slavishly-mascading windows, which was always
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.600]   the problem with the Linux their stops.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.560]   They were like one version of Windows behind.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.360]   Love Mike Masnek.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.400]   In terms of UX.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.960]   Tech Dirt.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:27.880]   He's talking about the New York Times.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.720]   They did a profile of Fusion, which is this new network.
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:34.000]   Partly owned by Univision.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.200]   Partly owned by Disney.
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:36.560]   Yes.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.560]   And they hired some of the best people out there.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.920]   Incredible, smart people.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:43.320]   Felix Salmon has won.
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.560]   Anna Holmes.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:47.280]   From the Atlantic.
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:47.840]   What's his name?
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.440]   Kevin Russe is there.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:59.920]   However, from the-- not fake-- leaked Sony emails.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:03.960]   According to his senior fusion staff members who
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.560]   spoke on the condition of anonymity--
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.160]   Because they were going to be beheaded.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:07.680]   Right.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.000]   Disney put the organization on notice.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.040]   It would not take kindly to coverage that Mike dent
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:16.520]   its standing with consumers after Fusion published
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:19.640]   several stories about the hacker document
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.240]   from Sony.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.880]   Fusion is not alone in negotiations
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.680]   to create a vice cable channel.
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:27.200]   Disney and Hearst insisted on the clause protecting
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:30.040]   the companies in the event that vice content
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.640]   embarrasses Hearst or Disney in any way.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.140]   Wow.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.440]   God, am I glad to be independent.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.280]   Geez.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.520]   Wow.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:40.000]   So we were talking-- this is how we started talking about how
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.200]   these big corporations do not understand editorial integrity.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.120]   It comes down to one person protecting you
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:51.280]   when I was at People magazine, which I confess.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.480]   My editor, Pat Ryan, may she rest in peace.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.000]   God bless her.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.040]   My mentor would protect me.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.560]   When I would criticize his HBO, Michael Fuchs
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.480]   that of HBO would scream up, fire that bastard.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.120]   They'll come right now.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.280]   And then she would say, F you back.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:03.480]   It will go back down.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.800]   But who's protecting people now?
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.080]   Is there somebody?
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.960]   What I'm saying is it comes to a brave boss or brave editor.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:12.000]   But the most insidious thing in a company like that
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.920]   is not necessarily what's ordered.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:16.080]   It's what people think might be ordered.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.240]   It's the chill.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:17.840]   Do you put on yourself?
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.320]   Caesar's wife must be above suspicion.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.480]   I don't know what that means.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:24.920]   What the-- hey, where does that come from?
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.640]   It's basically an experience.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.280]   I'm sorry.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.720]   I didn't say it in English accent.
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:29.120]   That's right.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.560]   Dad, I think this is a lie.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:30.920]   It's really a lie.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.720]   It must be above suspicion.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.720]   Brilliant.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:35.220]   Brilliant.
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:39.440]   There are some wisdom Americans who
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.360]   moved to the Guardian.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:41.800]   And they said that the British--
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:43.240]   I'm seeing what you think about this, Kevin.
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.200]   They throw them absolutely nuts.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.920]   Is the Brits will come up and say, you OK?
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.800]   And the Americans would say, you know something I don't know?
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:51.640]   Is there something wrong?
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.840]   Do I look bad?
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:56.760]   And I found out it was just a British way to say, how are you?
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.120]   Drew Kevin?
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.600]   Ah, interesting.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.960]   I don't recognize that one.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.720]   You don't know, OK.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.160]   Maybe they're trying to send American.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.200]   Maybe they're trying to sort of say something
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:12.480]   to the Americans that the Americans in some sort
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.520]   of reverse cultural thing of like, oh, America's not OK.
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:17.120]   It's not OK.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.640]   Yeah, it's not a problem.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:23.040]   You see it in the--
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:28.600]   Comcast knowing that soon the FCC will be taking comments
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.400]   complaints really under the new net neutrality regime, which
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:36.040]   begins in a few weeks.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:39.000]   Comcast quickly-- just the other day,
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.440]   he fixed up its internet connection with level 3.
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:45.640]   They've been going back and forth.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.280]   And a lot of this had to do with-- originally with Netflix,
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.840]   but just in general with this whole idea of gatekeeping,
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:56.240]   I think, and have paid tears.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.320]   So that's good.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:59.080]   You know, you want to clean all that stuff up
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:04.400]   before where there's actually teeth in the regulations.
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.120]   You wouldn't want that to get in the way.
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:11.120]   We mentioned give it all required by knowingly.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.400]   I thought you did more than I thought.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.400]   Yeah, see?
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.000]   You're red on the market.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:15.640]   Oh, no, I can.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.600]   You know, I tried doing this for a living.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.160]   All right.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.520]   Yeah, we accidentally blew through the list, didn't we?
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.200]   Well, we blew through your list.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.880]   And I can't wait for tomorrow.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.080]   It's going to be exciting.
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:31.960]   Yeah, it's going to be a crazy, crazy--
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.800]   We didn't even mention--
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.160]   with bloody fingers.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.680]   New photo app.
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:37.120]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:40.280]   Yeah, Google+ is losing its photo section.
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:41.080]   Well, not really because--
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:41.880]   Well, that's a question.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.840]   Are they taking it out of Google+, you think?
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.320]   Sure.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:45.960]   Of course.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:46.960]   I mean, what do you mean?
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:49.120]   Would it be in both places?
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.240]   I would imagine it would share to both.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.280]   Yeah, right.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.520]   But it's going to be like--
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:56.360]   it'll be a neutral kind of photo section.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.680]   Bradley is in charge, I think, of photos and streams.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:01.160]   Instead of--
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.920]   Yeah, Google+ is going to be just a stream.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.600]   And it'll-- it's not going to go anywhere.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.640]   How many times are you crossing stream jokes as he endured?
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.400]   We will watch that with interest.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:09.960]   Because that would, I think, be--
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.680]   beginning of the end for Google+, if they take the photos,
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:16.040]   capabilities out, and externalize them into a photos app.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.520]   I think Google's done with artificially propping up Google+
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:20.800]   though.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.840]   I mean, they just did the tweets and search results thing
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.880]   the other day.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:25.400]   And they're just like--
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:26.560]   Twitter one.
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.240]   But the issue is that they do need streams.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.960]   Facebook is a stream of attention.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:34.600]   Twitter is a stream of attention, and so on and so on.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.040]   Google does not have a stream of attention.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:38.920]   Google's still based on a page-based web.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:39.440]   And--
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:41.960]   Well, they have a stream of Google now.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:42.440]   They're actually--
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.480]   Not quite a stream of Google.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:46.000]   How much time do you spend with Google now?
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.680]   Well, but that's the Google way of looking at it.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:49.120]   The point is not to dominate your thing.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.600]   It's just to send you the best of the matter.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:51.120]   That's--
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.240]   Is it Google now the results, not the end?
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:58.160]   I mean, it's what you're using that to get is stuff.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.880]   The problem is that the advertising models
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.320]   will be based on attention streams.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:03.960]   And--
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:08.000]   Well, I don't think they put ads in Google now.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:08.500]   No.
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:09.280]   Well, they kind of do.
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.400]   I mean, they say--
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.880]   Really?
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:13.380]   Sure.
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:15.360]   They say places to go and visit and stuff like that.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.200]   Well, that's not paid.
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:16.640]   Was that paid?
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:17.200]   Why would maybe it--
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.560]   Is that paid?
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.960]   I do say paid.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.480]   Do you know it was paid?
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:24.560]   That would not be cool, man, if it was paid,
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.200]   and they didn't say it.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.280]   This is the first time, since I said on the show, right?
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.640]   I just had--
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:30.920]   You have a ton of stuff in there.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.200]   No, I don't have that much.
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:33.320]   It's because you're traveling.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.160]   I'm traveling this, right?
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.760]   Google now is so much better when you're traveling.
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.640]   I don't have Edward Snowden in here for the first time.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.200]   Every single time-- now I have tomorrow,
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.280]   and I wrote a post about Tomorrowland.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.880]   So now it's going to be there for weeks.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.400]   How'd you like that?
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:46.960]   It was OK.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:51.080]   I wrote a post on Medium arguing that the problem is,
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.160]   as I well know, that optimism doesn't sell.
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.760]   I said red then.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.040]   Cranky pessimism is always the way to go.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:58.880]   That's what it's saying.
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.960]   I've learned that taught me that years ago.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:02.280]   You got a problem with that?
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:03.560]   He's the master.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:07.040]   You can't-- basically, because I'm Mr. Smiley Smile.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.400]   I love it all, right?
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:09.680]   And he said, oh, you're stupidly.
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:10.760]   Oh, don't do that.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:14.080]   He said, you cannot go wrong, dissing a new technology.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.760]   Oh, occasionally you say something bad about a mouse,
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.400]   and people remember that for years.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.400]   But for the most part, you're right.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.680]   The most new technology is crap.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:27.680]   So it's a safe bet if you say, ah, ah, life's size.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.520]   Well, but it goes beyond that.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.240]   It's also, how's this going to ruin us?
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:33.360]   So my argument is that dystopianism
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.000]   is basically the ultimate and hubris,
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.080]   because it says, your fellow man and woman are too stupid
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:38.920]   to use this stuff.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.520]   They're going to use it to ruin life.
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:41.160]   They're all idiots.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.160]   And I'm smarter than them, because I can see this.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.080]   It's funny, because you wouldn't think this,
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:48.720]   but you are one of the most optimistic people I know.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:49.640]   Why wouldn't you think that?
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:50.720]   Because you're so cranky.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.520]   I'm not cranky.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.640]   God damn it.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:58.480]   How dare you say I'm not cranky.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:01.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:04.120]   No, but you're really quite the pie I'd optimist.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:04.600]   I am.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.680]   You believe in the future of humankind.
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:08.120]   Even more than you do.
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:08.920]   You're an optimist too.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:11.120]   But I mean, I'm an optimist, but it's hard to--
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.320]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.400]   We can have a chat room.
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:17.400]   In the face of the truth about people.
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.880]   Oh.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:21.400]   Are you an optimist, Ron?
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:21.960]   I think you're an optimist.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.240]   People say I'm rough on phones when I review them.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:26.760]   But yeah.
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:30.040]   Yeah, I'm always optimistic about stuff.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.080]   I hope for the best, but I have to say almost every phone
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:33.600]   disappoints.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:34.240]   Every phone disappoints.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.280]   There's yet to be the perfect phone.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:37.200]   Oh, come on.
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:37.800]   Wait a second.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.400]   Wait a second.
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:42.120]   You have a phone, and I can run, and I will tell you
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:42.600]   what's wrong with it.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.160]   Sure, you can find hope for what it can be.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.560]   But this is a miracle.
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.600]   The Nexus says--
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.840]   No phones in general.
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:49.600]   Well, if you are.
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.120]   --or a miracle.
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:50.480]   Right.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:53.960]   But just the people in charge of making them are not very--
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.960]   OK, every phone today is basically a game console.
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:01.600]   It's like the fastest possible specs you can imagine,
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:02.920]   like eight core processors.
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:04.440]   My S6 gets hot.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.680]   And like 2K screen.
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:07.880]   2, Louis CK.
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:10.560]   I'm flying over the Earth in a box,
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:12.360]   and I'm complaining about it.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:15.960]   Sure, but that doesn't mean that everything that is out
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.200]   is perfect, and there's no way.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.480]   No, I never said perfect.
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:20.680]   What I'm asking for is like a business phone.
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:23.160]   Remember like Blackberry, where you could have--
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:23.680]   What?
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.680]   Wait, Blackberry is your standard?
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.200]   Yeah, not that actual Blackberry.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.600]   But just that there is a market--
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:28.960]   Something with real functionality.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:30.680]   There is a market for something that values
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:33.760]   like battery life over just let's make the numbers on the spec
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:36.440]   sheet as big as possible so that the phone can--
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.680]   I have no idea what run crisis.
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:41.840]   Like what do they want to do with these eight core processors
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:42.520]   and everything else?
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.800]   But I think also, Jeff, it stipulated
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:50.400]   that this is a miracle, that we have in our pocket more power,
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:52.240]   basically a main--
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:52.680]   Supercube.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.520]   Yes.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.280]   That stipulated, that's not the issue.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.760]   And then you get greedy.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.440]   All of these are that.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:01.760]   Now the question is, but do they live up to--
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:02.920]   That's baseline exactly.
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.560]   It's miracle.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:05.560]   We live in the--
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:06.720]   There's the baseline.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:07.920]   Here's the way I've been doing.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.400]   There's my Matthew Ingram argument the other day.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.480]   Give me the business terms.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.880]   All right, so give me the terms of what
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:14.800]   would make a phone satisfy you.
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.240]   Well, apparently, Ron, one's battery.
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.080]   Blackberry, Blackberry.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:17.720]   OK, fine.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:21.120]   No, battery life is inadequate across the board.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.160]   Except maybe the one plus one.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:23.320]   The one plus one has decent battery.
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:24.720]   I charge my phone at 8 a.m.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:25.840]   Shout me note four.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.840]   Because I had to get up to get here for it.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:28.600]   And where are you now?
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:31.160]   So oh, I've charged it twice.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:32.840]   Yeah, I carry a battery.
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:32.840]   Geez.
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:33.840]   I don't know the problem.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:34.320]   Just.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.960]   Well, when you're traveling and you're
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:39.320]   going to be up for however many extra hours I'm
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.600]   going to be up for today, changing time zones--
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.000]   I phone does pretty well with battery.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:43.920]   I will grant you that.
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:47.480]   What else?
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.560]   Nothing.
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:49.640]   So just battery--
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.120]   Just battery.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.120]   You're satisfied.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.040]   No, no, no.
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:54.640]   Just don't give me a 2K screen.
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:57.120]   Don't give me eight core processors.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:00.160]   Oh, I love my 577 dots per inch.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:00.800]   What does that say?
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.320]   Approximately 12 hours left.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:02.920]   Look at that.
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:03.880]   Is that a one plus one?
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.040]   What is that?
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.360]   That's what makes a six.
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.640]   It says 12 hours left.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:09.600]   That says a lie.
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.600]   Because you haven't used it.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.000]   That's called Stand By.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.440]   Right, look at all your notifications.
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.240]   You have 10,000 of them because you haven't looked at your phone.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:18.120]   Stand By, my friend.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:20.000]   They do that on Google+ all the time.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.280]   They show that graph.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:24.760]   And then the question is, have you turned your phone on at all?
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:27.880]   And just every phone has as thin as possible.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:29.040]   And it's like nobody--
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:31.000]   Screen hasn't been on much yet.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.840]   What's the screen time?
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:33.600]   Not much.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.320]   You can get a little graph then.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.000]   They grow in that chart.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:35.920]   It is so useless.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:36.360]   It is.
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.280]   What is the little ticks and nicks?
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:41.000]   Well, no, I don't think that's a useful chart.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.280]   It basically is saying, of the time
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.440]   that was spent there, what was on it, where,
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.720]   and what was causing the drain.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:50.360]   And so I've got a decent Wi-Fi mobile network connection.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:51.440]   So that's not causing the drain.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.040]   Whereas if it's bad, then you get little yellow stripes there.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.200]   And then you see slopes in the thing.
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.280]   And the screen on little bands there,
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.080]   you tend to see slopes down there.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.240]   It's more useful when it isn't projecting like 12 hours.
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:06.800]   That's what's wrong with it is that it is Kevin Marks
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.440]   to explain it to you.
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.800]   But I find that useful diagnostic.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:12.960]   No, no.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:15.680]   But I actually download G-Sam battery monitor most of the time
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.600]   because I find that a little more granular little.
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.000]   So I have-- what's it called here?
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.480]   I have two hours left.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.680]   Two hours left.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:22.600]   And you've charged it twice earlier.
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.040]   I've charged it twice.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.000]   Look at that graph.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:27.520]   It just goes up and down, up and down, up and down.
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:28.720]   Is that-- but this is the charge?
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:30.760]   You can see the graph going up where it's charged, yeah.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.440]   I have battery guru on.
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.400]   Is that worthwhile or not?
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:34.440]   No, that does nothing.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.440]   It does nothing.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:35.920]   Take it off.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:36.440]   But if I--
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.200]   But if I-- it's not up there where the perception's bad.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.400]   So you'll-- it's not working hard.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:39.920]   No, no.
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:40.400]   It's been in my--
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:41.400]   It's haunted.
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:42.160]   What do you have right now?
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.360]   My mind's as cool as a cucumber.
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:45.400]   Really?
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:47.560]   My iPhone doesn't feel anything.
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:48.560]   It's on--
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:51.000]   It doesn't love anybody.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.800]   It is a cold, hot, slab--
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.480]   Glass and metal.
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:56.000]   And notice--
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.560]   You say that in a British accent.
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:58.560]   Yes.
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:59.200]   Yes.
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:02.400]   Let's-- let's get our tips and tools and numbers
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.880]   and things and all of that.
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.240]   Right, but one more thought on the phone.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.440]   So I had a fascinating conversation this week
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.480]   with Quinn Norton about this because she was--
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:13.080]   she was doing that art project that P&I
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.200]   know was talking about.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.120]   But she says she likes to write on her phone.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.280]   And there is now this small cult of people
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:21.360]   trying to find the Android phones that still
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.840]   have physical keyboards because they want to write on their phone
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.320]   and they like have physical keyboard.
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:27.400]   And it's hard because the market's moved against them.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.160]   And so that's another one of these things.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.680]   She really likes people to write on her phone.
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.680]   She has a lot of reporting from strange places.
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:35.880]   Having her query to keyboard she can type fast enough on is great.
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.400]   Having a screen chest to keep wiping
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:39.640]   because she's somewhere that--
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:42.160]   I can see that she and Ron are going to be on an island
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.320]   cult somewhere.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.640]   But Blackberry cult.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.080]   No, no.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.840]   That's a great example, though.
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.680]   You have all these companies and everybody
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:50.480]   makes the same phone.
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.280]   That's a good point.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:52.120]   That's a good point, yes.
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:53.520]   It would be a good one with keyboards and one
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:54.400]   with a really long battery.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:55.760]   It's just as fast as humanly--
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.200]   Well, but the fault there, I would argue,
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.360]   is not the manufacturer's fault.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:00.560]   There is, as always, as the telcos.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.160]   Because the telcos won't sell too many models.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.840]   And the review is, but yeah.
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:06.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.280]   No, because the review is giving you a checklist.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.200]   And so then it's like, has this got a good enough screen?
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200]   Right.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.040]   I think we are-- I think actually that is true,
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.400]   that we are somewhat default, that fault.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:18.720]   And have been for years with the feature charts,
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.840]   not just for phones, but for software.
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.240]   You can blame us for Norton internet security
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.680]   and Microsoft Word.
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.160]   Because we just have feature lists, right?
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:29.880]   And well, it's got all the checkboxes.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:31.280]   That's all people ever wanted.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:31.680]   I agree.
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:33.520]   I think it's our fault.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:35.480]   I take all the blame.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:37.880]   I try-- we try to do something I like
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:40.200]   to think of as functional reviews now,
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.760]   where we don't look at speeds and fees partly
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:45.440]   because a website's a better place for that.
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.640]   You can look at numbers.
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:51.640]   But video and audio is really about a motion about feeling.
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.440]   And so I think it's better for communicate
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:55.520]   how you feel about a phone and what
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:58.200]   the experience of the phone is like.
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:01.200]   And so we try to focus on that, kind of more functional
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:01.600]   review.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.920]   Yeah, the interface response.
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:06.960]   I hate when they hold the phone and read off a spec sheet.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.200]   Yeah, because you can see the specs.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:10.320]   That's not a problem.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:12.240]   But what does it like to be using?
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:13.680]   We try to do that with our review show.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.480]   What is it feel like-- should you buy this?
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.120]   What does it feel like to be the owner for a couple of weeks?
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:19.240]   How was that?
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:22.080]   But it's hard because every device is so good
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.360]   that the baseline is just like, well, this has 1% more
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:26.960]   than this for a company.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:29.840]   Well, battery life often is a killer, right?
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.160]   A deal breaker.
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:31.960]   On a lot of these.
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.440]   I mean, like half the time the biggest difference
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:34.440]   is the design.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:35.880]   The outside looks different.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.520]   Well, that's why I like the edge.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.200]   Oh, it's so pretty.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.640]   It's like a fine jewel.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.880]   The screen, curviness, doesn't bug you out like--
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:43.880]   Oh, totally bugs me.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:44.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.400]   Black.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.680]   No, it's horrible.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:49.280]   And there's all sorts of spurious touches
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:52.360]   because you're holding the screen.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.840]   But you love it.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:56.200]   But it feels beautiful in my hand.
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:58.520]   It's gorgeous.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.760]   It's beautiful.
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:00.880]   But see, that's what matters.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.800]   It doesn't work right, but it looks pretty.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:05.360]   Also, that's exactly what I'll talk about is, hey,
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:07.640]   this is the most beautiful phone I've ever used.
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.040]   I mean, it really is.
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.560]   However, you got this little issue.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.760]   But I mean, they're also close now that that's--
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.280]   It is.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:14.960]   That's what you want.
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:15.960]   It is pretty close.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:18.360]   Something that I want a phone that's just nice.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:21.240]   Because everybody has the same processor,
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:23.520]   the same amount of memory, the same screen resolution.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.760]   It's like--
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:28.200]   I have a super computer in my pocket, and I'm complaining.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.000]   Yeah, no.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:29.920]   We love our little phones.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.360]   Because you had to spend $600 on one of them,
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:32.840]   and you want your--
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:36.200]   I spent $2,300 for my Osborne 1.
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:38.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:39.200]   Right?
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:40.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.200]   We got one of the basement.
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:46.640]   I spent $3,000 for my neck impact printer.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:49.120]   I had to rewire the parallel cables.
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.560]   Kneepon Electric.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.640]   Yes, this is.
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:53.640]   This is--
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.800]   Mr. Marks, you got something tip,
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:58.720]   or you want to talk about-- oh, you got an indie web coming up.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:51:59.640]   Indie web camp.
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:00.600]   Indie web camp.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.880]   So indie web camp-- so indie web I've talked about before,
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:07.000]   it's the idea of using the web for your own purposes,
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.200]   not for companies' purposes at their shortest.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:12.560]   But indie web camp is the heart of this, which is--
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:15.040]   Indie web camp where everybody sleeps alone.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:18.880]   Because they're independent.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.480]   Oh, I thought just because it could get late.
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.480]   No.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:22.480]   No.
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:23.320]   Oh, I thought--
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:24.320]   I didn't mean that.
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.160]   I'm not too happy for that.
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:26.560]   I just met the Roxy search.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.920]   Independent.
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:28.440]   What a neck care--
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:29.200]   Sorry, Kevin.
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.760]   I was trying for a gag mirror.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:31.680]   It's been zero good.
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:32.200]   OK.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:35.840]   So what I'm trying to say is indie web camp
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.040]   is an IOT channel.
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:37.800]   It's a website.
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.400]   It's a whole bunch of things.
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:43.840]   But at its core, it's an annual camp over a weekend in Portland.
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:47.320]   And this year, it's July 11th to 12th.
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:51.080]   There are also other sites being set up as well.
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:52.320]   I'm not sure if they're all up yet,
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:54.600]   but people are talking about having a parallel one
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.720]   in Brighton and England and possibly one in Europe as well.
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:58.840]   It'd be a smart one.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:52:59.560]   Sorry.
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:00.360]   Try it again.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:03.280]   But previously as we've had--
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:04.920]   I think previously as we've had staggered ones
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.360]   in different places, and there were several of those this year,
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:07.680]   too.
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.480]   Last year, we had some going on in parallel
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.600]   in different parts of the world.
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:12.000]   So I think that's going on here.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.440]   But going up to Portland for the 11th and 12th of July
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:19.480]   is when this will be going on and doing this.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:22.960]   And the format is usually the first day we get together
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:24.920]   and talk about what we've already done on our sites
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.720]   and ideas and things.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.400]   And then the second day, we sit there and hack on something
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:31.320]   until we've got something new and interesting.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:32.440]   And then the end of the second day,
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:34.000]   we show off what we've built.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.680]   So it's a fun weekend of working on your own site
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:39.440]   and learning from other people who are doing the same thing.
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:43.480]   And I found it very useful over the past four or five years,
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:44.640]   four years, I think it is.
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:46.800]   I've been going.
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:48.760]   So just wanted to mention that.
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:51.040]   If you're interested in web development,
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:51.880]   have a look at that.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:55.640]   And also go to indyweb.com and look up our chat room,
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:56.360]   if you like.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:57.720]   And thank you for the work you do.
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:59.400]   Oh, I agree.
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:53:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:04.640]   I use with known as my blog platform, Leo Ville-Dottonette
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:05.560]   is there.
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:06.880]   And it's just great.
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.160]   And I really want to figure out, Kevin,
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.640]   and maybe while you're at indyweb.com,
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:15.600]   you can put a little bug and Ben in Aaron Jo's ear.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.880]   Because we're going to Europe at the end of June, actually.
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:19.760]   It'll be before the camp.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.880]   But I want to be able to journal from my trip.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:28.760]   And any webcap on mobile still doesn't-- it's hard to upload.
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:32.640]   I can't upload video and audio yet.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:37.080]   I want it to be a full tool that I can journal from.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:37.800]   They're getting there.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.480]   They've made amazing progress.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:40.920]   It's really kind of cool.
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:42.680]   Now, when I Instagram, it goes right there.
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:44.640]   We mentioned that last week.
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:45.720]   That's nice to me.
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:47.080]   All you have video are harder.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:52.680]   Because there's just not the support there at the web level.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.960]   It's basically the hard part--
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:55.320]   I think Ben read about this week.
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:58.040]   The hard part is it's very hard to get the phone
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:00.520]   to the transformation before it uploads.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.760]   So by default, the web stuff is set up
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:05.480]   to upload the raw version, which means it takes forever.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.800]   So you need a client-side app to translate it
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:10.600]   from the full version to the compressed version
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:11.560]   before you upload it.
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.320]   And that's the piece that's not quite there yet.
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:16.640]   So the answer may be a companion app that does that.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.240]   And then you then post those.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.600]   OK.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:20.600]   I'll take anything.
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:25.040]   And then I get a render video on your cell phone battery.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.760]   Oh.
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:27.760]   Oh.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.360]   You got a number for us?
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:30.440]   Was the title of his name?
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:31.520]   It's battery versus bandwidth.
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.200]   It is.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:33.280]   Yes.
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:38.920]   What was it I saw a board Elon Musk?
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.120]   That's a great Twitter account.
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:42.000]   It was something about how you're going to do a video
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.480]   of watching your battery go down.
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:45.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:47.960]   You ruined the punchline whenever it was.
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.000]   So this is a weird number.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.360]   So this is kind of a confession.
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:51.920]   In the past, when it comes to number time,
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.320]   and I've grasped for straws, I have
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:59.640]   gone to the Millward Brown brand value ranking.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:00.640]   Ah.
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:01.000]   Right.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.600]   And so I looked at it this year, and it said that Apple has
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.720]   retaken number one position from Google.
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:07.200]   OK.
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.640]   Apple's brand surged 67% in value.
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:13.880]   Well, how the hell do they know that?
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:14.880]   It's magic.
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:17.040]   So I looked up the methodology.
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.880]   And it's a bunch of smoke and hooey.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:21.680]   We've talked about this before.
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:22.160]   You have?
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:23.760]   Well, I think with you.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:24.120]   Really?
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:24.640]   Maybe not.
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:25.720]   But I--
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:26.520]   So they take--
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:29.240]   Maybe on Mac break weekly, because it's kind of goofy.
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.360]   We take the financial value--
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:31.160]   Brand C.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:33.680]   --and multiply it by brand contribution, which is expressed
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:35.120]   as a percentage of financial value.
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:36.760]   The result is brand value.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.000]   Brand value is the dollar amount of brand contributes
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.640]   to the overall value of the corporation.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:41.320]   What?
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:43.080]   And they measure such things supposedly
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.320]   as whether it's meaningful, different, and salient.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.440]   How do you measure that?
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.400]   It's the richest company ever.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:48.920]   That's good.
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.680]   I apologize for using this number.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:51.440]   Number one.
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:51.920]   Yes.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:53.080]   We are number one.
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:55.720]   Get them a foam finger.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:58.960]   It's actually pretty amazing, given that they're actually
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:00.840]   doing better than they were in--
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:01.400]   but in Steve--
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:02.080]   No, that's--
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:03.320]   --qualitatively.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:03.840]   That's true.
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:04.560]   Does anyone agree with that?
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.720]   Quantitatively.
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:07.920]   Does anybody agree with that?
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:08.420]   Yeah.
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:09.680]   Do you guys think--
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:10.520]   Well, no, I mean--
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:11.020]   Financially.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:11.520]   Financially.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:12.520]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:14.800]   I think I agree with you, no, no, no.
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.800]   Oh, I think brand value isn't going up.
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:17.160]   Absolutely.
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:17.840]   He's going up?
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:18.860]   Yeah.
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:20.040]   Look at this watch.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:22.080]   I think people pay in $17,000.
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:22.600]   How much?
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.960]   Smuck, spot it.
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:25.600]   $30,000 a week.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:26.120]   Really?
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:28.180]   Wow.
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.080]   Because I mean, that's interesting.
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:33.200]   That's interesting is like the first kind of Tim Cook
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.400]   product, I guess.
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:36.320]   I don't think it succeeds as a product, to be honest.
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:36.800]   That's really--
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.280]   But it's selling like hotcakes.
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:39.880]   And that doesn't hurt the brand?
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:41.280]   Well, in the long run, am I.
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.040]   Actually, that's a good question.
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:44.200]   That's a good question.
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:45.840]   Short run, no, but long run, am I?
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:46.200]   I don't know.
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:47.000]   This is a new thing.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.480]   I mean, it's probably pretty hard to screw up the iPhone.
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:50.480]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.200]   It's hard to come up with a successor to the iPhone.
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.240]   You guys were just a minute ago complaining
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:56.360]   how imperfect it was.
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:56.920]   Wow.
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.720]   Nothing's perfect, Jeff.
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:00.720]   We know that.
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:02.080]   But it's pretty good.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:05.120]   But I'm just saying that that's the challenge is,
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:07.280]   if you had the most accessory--
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.400]   I think arguably the most successful product
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:13.000]   in the history of the world, which in the iPhone,
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.640]   how are you going to do better than that?
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:17.200]   Water.
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:17.760]   OK.
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:18.920]   Make it faster.
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:20.280]   That's always the answer.
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:21.360]   And apparently, this year--
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.320]   And thinner.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:22.840]   And bigger?
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:25.760]   Bigger, faster, thinner.
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:28.080]   Do you have anything you'd like to share with us?
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.720]   I mean, we don't have to.
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:32.080]   I don't know if we're surprising you.
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:36.400]   But any tool that you'd like to use?
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.080]   What's your phone?
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:39.960]   Do you found a phone with a perfect keyboard?
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.680]   I don't want a keyboard.
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:42.440]   Oh, you're not--
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:43.440]   It's not you that wants a keyboard.
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:43.940]   He's the battery.
[01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:44.760]   Kevin's friend works better.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:45.680]   I want a giant battery.
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:47.040]   When wants the keyboard?
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:47.560]   All right.
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:48.200]   Who wants the keyboard?
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:50.920]   My favorite tool is a gigantic battery that's
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:52.680]   big that I carry with me.
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:55.120]   I found a-- there's one company that
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:59:01.280]   makes a Qualcomm 2.0 Quick Charger battery.
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:02.160]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:02.840]   I've heard about this.
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:04.040]   And that's nice to have.
[01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:05.880]   It's called Aussie, A-U-K-E-Y.
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:08.880]   It's about-- it's almost 20,000 milliamp hours or something.
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:10.960]   It's enough to charge a phone a few times.
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:14.200]   And it's less standard size of all these kind of like cigarette
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.280]   pack batteries.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:16.840]   So I carry that around my briefcase.
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.240]   And that's going to give me three charges.
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:21.000]   And in about an hour, I'll get full charge, which is nice to
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:21.200]   have.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:21.560]   There it is.
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:24.040]   A-U-- no, that's not it.
[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:25.280]   It's a company, right company.
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:26.160]   But they make--
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:26.840]   They make those really cool--
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:27.600]   They make a quick charge.
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:28.000]   There it is.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.320]   That silver thing.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:31.680]   Yeah, it's just a battery with it.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:33.680]   It's like you've seen these a million times.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:35.720]   But it's the only one that I know of this Qualcomm Quick
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:37.400]   Charger 2.0 certified.
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:39.120]   OK, it's only 10,000 milliamp hours.
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.360]   Is that the same quick charge that--
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.400]   Four charges?
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:45.920]   Yeah, it would work with the Nexus 6.
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:48.240]   But maybe your Galaxy S6?
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:48.640]   Maybe not.
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:49.840]   It does work with the Galaxy S6.
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:50.440]   Yep, just fine.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:50.880]   OK.
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:52.800]   Well, then that weird because it's an Exynos.
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:54.000]   But somehow it does quick charge.
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.600]   Well, I mean, it's just more voltage.
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:57.600]   So it shouldn't be too hard.
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:00.200]   But it's just more voltage.
[02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.760]   From your mouth to God's ears, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:07.400]   Rana Mario from Ars Technica, Ars Technica.com,
[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:10.240]   you must read him every single day because he--
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:12.200]   No, seriously, I do.
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:13.240]   So you should too.
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:13.760]   That's awesome.
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:15.400]   It's a really great resource.
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:17.840]   We don't do reporting.
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:19.440]   We do commentary.
[02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:23.560]   I let you hardworking fellas do the reporting.
[02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:24.080]   Get out there.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:25.440]   Yeah, start tomorrow.
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.600]   I'm ready.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:28.600]   You're going to live, blog the whole thing.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.280]   Probably.
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:30.360]   On this?
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:30.720]   Yes.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:31.120]   OK.
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:33.280]   What time are you showing up with Soni tomorrow, Maureen?
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:35.360]   I don't know.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.560]   I need to go see Andrew and talk about that.
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:37.960]   I don't know.
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:39.360]   Early, very early.
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:39.920]   Who knows?
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:40.920]   When are you showing up tomorrow?
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:41.520]   When we get done drinking--
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:42.320]   When we get done drinking--
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:42.840]   You're going to get in life.
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:43.880]   Is it about Soni and West?
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:45.440]   It's about Soni.
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:45.960]   The big one.
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:46.880]   Yeah, I think so.
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:47.640]   And the last little--
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:48.000]   The last little one.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:48.000]   The last little one.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:48.480]   The last little one.
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:50.000]   It's like the little one.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.200]   The West is not the big one.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.360]   The big one's on the day on the ground.
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:53.360]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:53.840]   Yeah.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:55.200]   Everything's at West, isn't it?
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.840]   Yeah, West is where Steve would give his--
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.520]   Hollowed Ground, yes.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:02.840]   As his iPhone keynote was at West.
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:05.240]   The iPad was not.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:07.760]   That was Urban Buena Center.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.240]   All right, well, we'll cover it tomorrow.
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:10.000]   I'm excited.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.080]   We'll be watching.
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:13.520]   I'll look for your shining faces in the audience.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:14.520]   And our tweets.
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:15.520]   And your tweets.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:17.240]   I'll follow your live blog at ours.
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:18.520]   Techthegotta.com.
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:20.320]   How much periscoping will be going on?
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:24.080]   I'll be looking for Kevin Marks to sneak in.
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:26.040]   I'll see if I can sneak in.
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:27.160]   I'm going to sneak in.
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:28.480]   I'm probably going to get out in the afternoon,
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:30.480]   which I won't get up in the crack of dawn and head up there.
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:32.520]   But I will probably watch it from home.
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.320]   And so you're the kind of guy you like to go to the--
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.880]   you like to go to the track in the seminars.
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:36.520]   Yeah, the real stuff.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:37.120]   Conferences.
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:37.840]   You like to--
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.560]   Yeah.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:39.960]   But also, I mean, the thing about the keynote
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:41.080]   is you can do--
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:42.920]   pretty much do as much if I were watching the stream
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:44.640]   and tweeting as you're kind of by sitting in the room.
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:46.040]   Because everyone else is just sitting there
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:46.880]   listening to it anyway.
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:47.960]   Absolutely.
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:50.160]   I love doing what we do.
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:51.920]   People often think that I'm mad at Apple
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.320]   because I don't get invited to Apple.
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:55.600]   That's no, I would still be here.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:57.480]   Because as long as they stream it,
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.680]   the hard thing is when they don't stream it.
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:01.560]   But then we're needed more than ever
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:04.280]   to analyze the live blogs altogether.
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:06.920]   I was way more informed when I didn't write.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:09.600]   And I could sit at home and just watch everything.
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:10.080]   Absolutely.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.920]   Now I have to deal with logistics.
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:12.960]   All the time.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:17.320]   930 AM Pacific, 1230 Eastern time.
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:20.360]   We go live right after TNT tomorrow morning.
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:23.040]   Gina Tarpani will join me along with Ron Richards.
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:25.480]   And Aaron Nukem, it's going to be good.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:26.840]   It's going to be fun.
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:28.400]   We shall have fun.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.400]   You and I.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:31.880]   And I thank you for being here.
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:33.480]   Thanks, Kevin.
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:34.320]   Thank you.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.400]   Have fun tomorrow, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:37.600]   Thank you for being here.
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:38.520]   It's so nice to see you.
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:43.520]   How wonderful to be here at A.D.
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:44.520]   We're going to launch.
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:45.520]   OK, good.
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:46.520]   Thanks to you.
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:47.520]   Thank you for launching.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:48.520]   Ron and Mario, what did you get?
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:49.520]   I had the salmon.
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:50.520]   It was good.
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:51.520]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.520]   It's great.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:55.520]   Arse Technica.com, thank you for being here.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:56.520]   Anytime.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:57.520]   Yeah.
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:58.520]   Really nice.
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:01.520]   We do this show right after Windows Weekly.
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:02.520]   Right?
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:03.520]   Usually that's supposed to be.
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:04.520]   Right after the beer.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:05.520]   Right after the beer.
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:06.520]   The beer happens on Wake Up.
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:09.520]   If you're here to be your pick, then you know it's Jeff soon.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:11.520]   1 p.m. Pacific, roughly.
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:12.520]   One ish.
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:13.520]   One ish.
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:15.520]   4 p.m. eastern time.
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.520]   That'd be 2000 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.520]   And yes, we're going to keep doing the live stuff.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:23.520]   Forget what I said.
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:24.520]   I gave up.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.520]   You can also find us on demand.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:29.520]   I know I'm impulsive.
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:30.520]   I was upset.
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:32.520]   With good reason.
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:35.520]   Well, you know, what happened is, I mean, I really, I was serious
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:40.520]   about it because I, but I didn't realize that's not going to do anything.
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.520]   Jerks be jerks regardless.
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:44.520]   And Lisa, Lisa talked to me off the ledge.
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.520]   She said, "Don't worry.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:46.520]   We'll figure it out.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:47.520]   We'll find a way."
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:50.520]   And you know, I also heard from like 8 million people.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:53.520]   That didn't hurt.
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.520]   So you have been heard.
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:59.520]   You can also get to on demand versions of this show and all the shows, including the specials
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:00.520]   at Twit.tv.
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:02.520]   This show is at Twit.tv/Twig.
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:08.520]   YouTube.com/ThisWeekInGoogle.
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.520]   iTunes, all the places.
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:11.520]   Podcast app.
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.520]   You got the new deal with Spotify.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.520]   Spotify is a big deal.
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:18.520]   You know, it's not on Android yet because so it's on iOS.
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:19.520]   I know it will be.
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:20.520]   So it's on iOS.
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:25.520]   And even then you have to go into the iOS app and go into settings and then they'll say,
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:26.520]   "Do you want the new features?"
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:27.520]   And you say, "Yes."
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:30.520]   And then your interface will change and you'll see a shows button.
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:32.520]   We're there, audio, and video, all our shows.
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:33.520]   This is a great...
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:35.520]   I mean, we're really excited about this.
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:38.520]   And apparently, you know, they've been playing this for a while.
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:42.520]   Apparently, I was told by their PR or whoever, their technical contact, Daniel X said,
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:44.520]   "If you're going to have podcasts, you've got to have Twit."
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:45.520]   So thank you, Daniel.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:48.520]   We're really, really thrilled about that.
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:51.520]   And it's not the end of the news on that in that regard.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:57.520]   There will be more and more ways to consume, not to mention a new website next week.
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:58.520]   And...
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.520]   Is it next week?
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:03.260]   - All this work, all this money is finally paying off.
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:07.000]   The API is out.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.220]   - Yeah, the API is luck.
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:12.620]   There's people right away, right now going,
[02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:16.620]   but we will see how it will be soon.
[02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:18.460]   - Yay, good news.
[02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:20.340]   - I was hoping June 1st, I'm thinking now.
[02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:22.240]   - You have given up hope and now you have it back.
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:23.500]   - Never gave up hope.
[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:24.820]   - Will you get preview?
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:27.520]   - I don't know how well it's working right now.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:31.520]   The images aren't, 'cause the certificate isn't there.
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:34.920]   So let me just see, I probably not.
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:36.360]   Let me just see if we get the images.
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:38.480]   No, see images are still broken.
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:40.640]   So you get a bad experience 'cause you don't,
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:42.360]   that's not the layout at all.
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:43.360]   - I'm not getting your feed.
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:45.960]   - That's okay, if it's not getting the images,
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:46.800]   then let's not show it.
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:47.800]   - Yeah, no, yeah.
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:49.960]   I'll tell you, I'll tell you.
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:52.880]   So this is the key live on demand apps.
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:55.080]   We're gonna link to the apps.
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:58.600]   - Subscribe, we have a schedule now that actually works.
[02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:00.440]   - Yay.
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:02.800]   - We just, the Google calendar's stuck in there.
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:06.480]   Hey, why, I found out what it cost to rewrite Google Calendar.
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:09.640]   I said, no, no, maybe we'll just use Google Calendar.
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:11.920]   You'll be on here, people.
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:13.040]   - Yeah.
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:13.880]   - I'm a person.
[02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:15.720]   - We're gonna get pictures.
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:18.600]   People, yeah, it's all there.
[02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:20.360]   We'll tell you when it's, well, you don't have to,
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:21.200]   we don't have to tell you.
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.920]   You'll know, you'll go to the site, you go, what the hell?
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:24.800]   It all changed.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:25.640]   It's all different.
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:26.720]   - And then they'll complain.
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:27.640]   They always complain.
[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:30.400]   - And, oh, the complaints will begin instantly.
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:31.240]   - Yeah.
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:32.920]   - 'Cause it needs a bigger battery.
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:33.760]   - Yeah.
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:34.600]   - That's the batteries.
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:35.440]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:37.000]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:37.840]   Bye-bye.
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:40.420]   (upbeat music)
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:43.000]   (upbeat music)
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.580]   (upbeat music)
[02:06:45.580 --> 02:06:47.660]   you
