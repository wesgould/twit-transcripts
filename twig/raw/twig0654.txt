[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.180]   their second biggest acquisition of all time,
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.800]   a security firm that actually is in the news today.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.000]   Twitter has announced a new tour onion service

[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.680]   They found Edward Shackleton's boat,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.120]   the Endurance, deep beneath the ocean in the Antarctica.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.960]   We've got some pictures.

[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.000]   but Google.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.720]   So maybe this week, but Google, Twig.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.440]   Stary C, Higginbotham is here.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.440]   It's great to see you Stacey from, I know, Stacey on IOT.com
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.720]   and the fabulous IOT podcast.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.080]   They just had their corporate retreat.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.320]   They had a team building exercise.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.120]   Team building exercise.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.920]   Did you tell Kevin?
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920]   Did you tell Kevin to catch me?
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920]   Yes, exactly.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.760]   Exactly.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.280]   Exactly.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.320]   Did you tell Kevin to catch me?
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.800]   Yeah, no.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.960]   You better, boy.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.360]   I spray spray spray for the whole thing.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.880]   Hi, my name is Kevin and my favorite ice cream flavor
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   is chocolate.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.400]   Also with us, the Leonard Taap professor
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.640]   for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.200]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.360]   Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis, hello, Jeff.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.920]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.240]   Do you ever get called Jeffrey?
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.080]   Only with my mother when she was a lot.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.760]   Jeffrey.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.640]   She was enraged at me, really pissed
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.120]   because our wedding invitation,
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.920]   when she saw her printed out, I didn't, I didn't, Jeff.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.400]   How could I do that?
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.800]   It was just, oh, she was very formal.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.600]   Exactly. Yeah.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.920]   And Stacey, did you stay salicious?
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.040]   Higginbotham on your wedding.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.320]   Stay, stay salicious.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.440]   Stay salicious. No.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.760]   Okay.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.200]   That was not.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.920]   Although I'll throw this out to everybody.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.680]   Ideas accepted two weeks from today is my husband's and I
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.560]   are 20th anniversary.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.520]   Oh, that's a big one.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.360]   It feels like that, but I just looked up.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.680]   I was like, oh, crap.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.840]   He's like, it's in four days.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.440]   What do we do?
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.880]   And I was like, no, no, it's much later.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.480]   But yeah, if anyone has any ideas,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.120]   I don't even know what to do for 20 years.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.760]   Oh, that's a huge anniversary.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.880]   That's, it's kind of a lot of time.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.600]   I think you have to go to Paris, as I remember.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.720]   We're going in July.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.720]   So that's what he said.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.960]   We are perfectly.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.720]   So I'm like, okay, we're done.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.960]   Perfect.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.200]   And yeah, that counts.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.880]   That counts.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.320]   We're going to Skitka, Sitka, Alaska and July.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   Oh, that'll be fun.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.920]   Yeah, it's already coming.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.240]   That's the Twig Cruise.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.080]   I know.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.040]   Oh, I forgot about the Twig Cruise.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.280]   So did everybody.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.600]   Wait.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.640]   Oh, what is it?
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.560]   What is it?
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.320]   It's July 16th to the 23rd.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.680]   Cruise.twig.tv.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.520]   Although I don't, I think it might be sold out.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.440]   I don't know.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.680]   But check if you want to go.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.680]   It's not too late.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.480]   It'll be Lisa, my wife and I, and Paul Therat and his wife.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.760]   And we'll be probably-- and then there's
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.120]   a few other windows people who are going, who've
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.040]   jumped on as well.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.200]   So it's going to be a fun event.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.400]   The Twig Cruise to Alaska.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.000]   I'll tell you what.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.960]   If it goes well, which is so far has gone very well,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.800]   we'll do another one.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.520]   And you can go.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.960]   You guys can go cruise to--
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.680]   If I may be so nosy as to ask.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.720]   Is this an excuse to get a free trip to Alaska for yourself?
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.280]   Or do you actually make some money on it?
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   No.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.000]   That's a very good question.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.800]   I used to do cruises for insight cruises, which
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.200]   was geek cruises at the time.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   And I did about 10 of them.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.600]   And at the time, I was doing them
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.320]   because they were free cruises.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.400]   But then I realized it's free and name only.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.680]   You really have to work pretty hard.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.920]   And at this point, we can afford to pay for our cruises.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   So it's really more--
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.840]   I think it's more a team building exercise
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.280]   for our Twit friends community.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.400]   I think we make $50 a head or something.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.840]   In some ridiculous amount.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.720]   So there will be some money in there, but not a huge amount.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.320]   Not much yet.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.640]   But it's nice to see your audience.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.720]   Yeah, mostly it's the--
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.400]   honestly, that's the real reason to do it, just to hang out with.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.680]   Well, Paul, and you're hanging out,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.240]   you don't have to do programming.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.040]   You just have to do some.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.040]   Oh, we have to do some.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.560]   You're just programming.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.640]   We have to do some.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.360]   We have cocktail parties.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.760]   We have several events we have to do.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.040]   But we want to do more.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.800]   We're actually doing more than we're required to do.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.080]   Yeah, what I mean is you don't have to lecture or something.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.720]   Yeah, we have one lecture.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.200]   Oh, really?
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.720]   But just to the--
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.920]   me, the thing I know the most about.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.400]   Oh, dear.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.680]   No, it's--
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.200]   I don't know.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.400]   There's-- yeah, I think there's one--
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.560]   there's like a meet and greet.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.200]   There's some events, yeah.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.200]   And one of which Paul and I will take to a stage in swap
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.360]   war stories or something.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.160]   Can you go salmon fishing or anything?
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.200]   You could if you want.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.240]   There's lots of excursions.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.560]   I'm actually now debating whether I should really go
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.280]   mush huskies on a glacier.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.800]   But that is an option.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.360]   I hear that that's super fun.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.200]   A friend of mine is done that.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.760]   It seems really fun.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.560]   OK.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.720]   Good.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.040]   Maybe we'll do that.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.920]   Maybe we'll do that.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.720]   Well, if I'm back from Paris, I'm happy to wave you all
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.680]   goodbye at the--
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.560]   So that's your 20th anniversary.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.440]   You're like, good.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.120]   Doesn't have to be at the same day.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.480]   But that'd be on the contrary.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.680]   Yeah, that's perfect.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.880]   That's very romantic.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.240]   And I will tell you that I believe--
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.480]   I'm going to work.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.200]   Does that count?
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.080]   I'm giving a speech on low-power, wide-area networks.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.920]   You got a good deal.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.800]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   How do they see that in French?
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.600]   It's so romantic.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.000]   I'm like, petites.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.800]   I don't know.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.080]   I think they call those LP WANs in French.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.960]   It'll be a bit le el-piwan.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.200]   I do want to warn you that they call Wi-Fi weafy.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.520]   So get ready for that.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.600]   And they call Vladimir Poutine.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.720]   Poutine, which I love.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.200]   OK.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.800]   Speaking of-- I feel guilty about even talking
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.400]   about vacations and cruises and trips to Paris
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:51.040]   with a horrific war of aggression going on in Ukraine.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.320]   And of course, for the last--
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.800]   whatever it's been now, two weeks,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.320]   that's all we've been talking about on these shows even.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.360]   Because there's a huge tech angle to all of this.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.800]   I don't know how much we want to spend.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.240]   But as you know, Google has pulled out of the market.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.160]   It's App Store out of the market.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.800]   But there are Russian App stores.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.440]   And you take a wild guess what the number one app is
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.480]   in the Russian App Store.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.720]   It's VPNs.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.280]   Like, wow.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.840]   They just took off in the last couple of days.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.360]   Which I think is sort of encouraging.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.400]   I mean, we're seeing half a million downloads of VPNs
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.200]   in this past week alone.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.640]   And I think that means that they want to get real news.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.080]   They don't want the--
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.800]   Julie Ioffi, who is my favorite commentator on this,
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.200]   and she's just utterly brilliant.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.600]   And she's Russian and American.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.120]   And she talks about how the only way you can get any information
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.360]   now is by setting up a VPN.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.160]   And that's only going to be a very small elite doing it.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.000]   But that's it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.480]   That's the only way.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.280]   I was listening this morning to the Puck News podcast.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.560]   That's where she is now at Puck.News.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   And she was on the podcast.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.720]   She was practicing in tears.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.280]   She was just devastated.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.080]   It's been really affects her.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.240]   She has friends.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.120]   And also just for the state of Russia.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.360]   It'd be an effects for Ukraine, obviously.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.960]   But also for Russia, people are leaving.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.920]   I've been reading the Helsinki Sunday Mat
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.680]   thanks to Google Translate.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.920]   And there are train loads of Russians getting the heck out,
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.320]   trying to figure out where to go.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.600]   They're credit cards. I enjoy a report of this.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.200]   The credit card supposedly pulled out.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.360]   They still work in Russia.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.400]   The problem is they don't work outside of Russia.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.840]   So the people who are getting the hell out
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.080]   can't use their credit cards now.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.680]   And then you can't go to an ATM.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.480]   No, in fact, one of the places they said,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.400]   I saw somebody did an hour-long video about how to leave.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.280]   And it was in Russia.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.080]   I didn't know.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.760]   But whoever summarized it said that if you can still
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.800]   use the Chinese credit card clearances.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.440]   So in some cities, if you go to Chinese restaurants,
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.680]   you can use that for their customers and you can eat.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.440]   Corey Doctorow was on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.720]   We talked a little bit about why kicking Russia off the internet
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.520]   would be a very bad idea.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.120]   Yes.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.800]   Ukraine asked ICANN to suspend Russian internet domains.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.480]   Really?
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.040]   But ICANN was never going to do that.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.080]   I mean, that's actually a relatively common ask.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.800]   Andrea and I were talking about that.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.840]   Not relatively common.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:38.360]   But countries do ask this for various conflicts
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.040]   or governments will ask ICANN to take their country offline
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.760]   as a form of punishment or censorship.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.720]   I mean, there's all kinds of--
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.160]   it's not that uncommon, is it?
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.560]   Motherboards quote from Frederick Jennings,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.360]   a cybersecurity lawyer from Brooklyn said,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.960]   asking, ICANN to remove.ru tlds or take action
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.720]   against Russian internet traffic is like asking Rand McNally
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.520]   to remove Russia from the map, probably ethically defensible,
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.680]   but practically absurd and counterproductive.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.760]   And ICANN said, look, this is not--
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.480]   we are non-governmental.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.520]   And the last thing we want to do is get political,
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.440]   because of course it was Russia that
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.320]   was pushing to get the US Commerce Department out
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.600]   of ICANN and other internet activities,
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.320]   because they felt like it was America being too involved.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.920]   So this would just give them another more leverage into that.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.480]   So ICANN was very clear that, no, no, no, that's not how it works.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.320]   It's the right decision.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.840]   Yes.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:45.480]   And this is one thing that concerns me a lot of the sanctions.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.120]   It would have side effects, harmful side effects,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.680]   that wouldn't really hurt Putin, but might hurt the Russian
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.000]   people, might hurt the world economy, might hurt other things.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.400]   It's very challenging to think of what sanctions you can do
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:06.600]   that would be persuasive to a madman and not really
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.240]   hurt the people of Russia.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.560]   But you also want political pressure.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.360]   The other thing that Julia Ophi says
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.480]   is that Moscow has long been anti-Putin.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.040]   He's surrounded by the people who don't like him,
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.840]   but the entirety of the Russia is very pro-Putin, pro-war.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.600]   But what are they going to do?
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.760]   Rise up against him?
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.160]   They may-- At some point?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.240]   They may not be happy.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.760]   Yeah, but I mean, is that your strategy?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.040]   That's how we're going to deal with Putin?
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.200]   I don't know.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.720]   You actually have a good article.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   You wrote it Buzz Machine.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.320]   What is our moral line in Ukraine?
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.000]   This was-- and I had no position here.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.080]   I was trying to just think through the implications
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.600]   of the tough decisions.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.720]   We're obviously not going to do a no-fly zone.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.320]   And that's the simple thing to figure out,
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.200]   because how do you enforce it in a no-fly zone?
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.320]   Well, you're going to shoot Russian planes out of the sky.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.000]   That's how you enforce it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.080]   That seems like a bad idea at this point.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.080]   That's an act of war.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.560]   Right.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:13.800]   But in a way, so if we say that he can do anything up
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.280]   to using a nuke, then that gives him license
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.160]   to do lots of horrible things.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.680]   So is there a different line?
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.320]   If he used chemical weapons, we'd do it.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.360]   He's using his thermobaric weapons.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.520]   We're letting him do it.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.840]   So in a sense, this line in the sand
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.880]   gives him license to use any other weapon,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.640]   the same as the NATO line.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.560]   If he attacked Finland tomorrow, are we now saying we wouldn't
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.760]   do anything the same as we did for Ukraine?
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.280]   So we've given him license to do that.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.320]   There's also a secondary issue, which
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.080]   is that China is watching very carefully
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.480]   because, of course, they'd like to invade Taiwan.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.440]   And calculating, I would imagine,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.800]   was a great precision, what would be the consequence
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.880]   to them of doing that and watching
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.760]   and see what the West does.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.280]   So there's more than just controlling Putin.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.800]   Yep.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.640]   But Fredenbein is the former president of Estonia,
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.440]   Thomas Edelvis.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.760]   And it's fascinating to watch him on Twitter
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.360]   because he really hates Putin and Russia.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.160]   And says, basically, I've been warning you all these years.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:24.920]   Are you going to listen?
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.760]   And he said to Finland, all right.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.920]   Are you going to listen?
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.240]   Well, that was-- one of the points Corey made
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.360]   is that we've been building up to this for 20 years.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.600]   Our America policy and NATO policy
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.760]   has really been preparing the way for this all along.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.920]   But that's not very useful at this point.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.960]   It's like, OK, great.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.640]   Let's take a time machine back.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.840]   What do we do today is the real question.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.120]   And what can we do today and what will be effective today?
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.400]   One of the things I brought up--
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:59.280]   it reminds me of how much--
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.400]   and you've always said this, Jeff, don't regulate
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.360]   use norms to control behavior.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.160]   Don't regulate the internet, use norms.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.240]   How much we rely on norms in our lives.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.240]   But when people are willing to act outside the norms,
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.800]   this came to me.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.280]   I was watching a video of a drugstore in Los Angeles
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.840]   where a guy just walks behind the counter,
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.320]   starts loading a bag with stuff behind the counter.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.160]   And everybody's like freaked out.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.320]   Somebody's calling 911.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.560]   But the guy's going to--
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.640]   is walks out the door with all this stuff.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.280]   He violated a norm.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.400]   We're so used to that norm.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.320]   We think we're somehow protected.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.960]   There's no consequence to that.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.560]   This was the entire Trump presidency.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.560]   Was that guy who was repeatedly willing to violate--
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.080]   That's right.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.280]   I mean--
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.120]   And then what do you do?
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.360]   Well, that's-- I think that's one of the things
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.640]   that we've learned over the last few years is that--
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.680]   well, in that case, you have to have some sort of accountability
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.000]   or response that is--
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Yeah, that's the challenge.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.360]   You have to use force.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.760]   That's when the state comes in when you're like--
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.000]   Oh, yeah, but--
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.520]   Now we have to regulate this.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.160]   Yeah, but--
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.600]   When you're using a force against another nuclear power--
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.840]   --stakes are so high.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.640]   And this is where--
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.880]   I don't think we have a good solution.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.120]   It's interesting to watch--
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.280]   Oh, yeah, this is a--
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.000]   Go ahead.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.200]   --terrible-- no, this is a terrible problem.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.080]   It is-- I mean, this is where--
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.520]   this is a snotty kid with nukes, basically.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.840]   Just having a tantrum and going as well.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.280]   Honestly, and this is Julia Ioffi's take,
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.400]   a guy with nothing to lose.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.280]   And that's really scary.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.920]   And she points out this is the problem with people--
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.280]   with dictators, with people like Hitler and Paul Pot
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.840]   and so forth.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.760]   Hitler wanted Germany to be destroyed
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.480]   if they couldn't win.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.280]   The country did not deserve to exist, fortunately.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.120]   His generals did not follow up on his--
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.840]   But there's a piece of that to Stacey--
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.280]   Stacey is exactly right about Trump's time.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.120]   And my argument is that that's about people
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.200]   who know that they're going to lose their white hegemony.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.000]   And they don't want to share it with those who follow.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.560]   And so they'd rather destroy the institution--
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.400]   Scorched to them.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:13.720]   Yep.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.560]   So the reason I bring this up is we're seeing a lot of companies,
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.080]   tech companies, try to respond in a way that's reasonable.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.560]   But it's also-- there's two kinds of reasons
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.200]   you'd respond.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.120]   One is it's-- it looks good.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.680]   It looks bad not to.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.400]   Or we can't get our money out anyway,
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.520]   so we might as well shut down.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.320]   Maybe that's another reason because we can't help it.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.720]   And then there's the third-- you're really trying to do some good.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.000]   And there's, I think, a very strong question about,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.320]   well, what can you do that's going to do some good?
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:44.960]   One of the things--
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.200]   We don't want Google to leave entirely,
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.640]   because we want people to have some access to information.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.240]   Well, there's a good example.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.960]   Apple and Google both pull down their app stores,
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   leaving many Russians who wanted to use signal--
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.480]   Right.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.840]   --in the dark because they could no longer get it, or a VPN,
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.360]   because they could no longer get it.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.680]   And so, yeah, OK.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.360]   Do you think they should have left the app store up?
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.200]   I don't know.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:10.680]   I don't know.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.280]   What do you think?
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.640]   I don't know what the answer is.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.400]   You certainly want to send a very strong signal
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.560]   that this is not OK.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.080]   But you also don't--
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.200]   I mean, look, the Russia-- most of the Russian people
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.200]   are innocent in this, right?
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.040]   Stacy, what do you think?
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.600]   I mean, this is the sort of thing we debate over dinner
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.160]   at our house.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.360]   So I think--
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.760]   I think-- here's the issue.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.360]   I think most people in Russia--
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.320]   it's like 120 million people, 110 million people.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.560]   It's a lot of people.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.040]   And even if you look at your VPN stats,
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.000]   not everybody cares to know or wants to know or seeks this out,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.280]   right?
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.960]   So you've got to recognize that by pulling--
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.360]   145 million.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:57.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.480]   And there's 40 million in Ukraine.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.440]   OK.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.520]   So if you take their access away, not all of them
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.960]   we're going to access it anyway, what you're doing
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.360]   is taking easy access away.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.320]   And I still think in times of war,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.280]   the people who want the information
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.360]   will actually go to efforts to get it.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.440]   Does that make sense?
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:24.640]   That's what--
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.560]   So I think it's located together.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.120]   That was the doctrine in China, right?
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.320]   Yeah, but that doesn't work out well.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.400]   And you also not just go to get information.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.320]   You also create languages to share information in China.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.600]   You create heuristics to stand for things,
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.560]   because you can't use the actual--
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.200]   And it's ever evolving.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.440]   So we've mentioned before, we'll probably mention a lot.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.400]   The Ukraine Minister of Digital Transformation,
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.560]   the 32-year-old Michaela Fedorov here
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.200]   shown in a black hoodie appropriately,
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.800]   has called for hackers to come to the aid of Ukraine.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   And the response has been dramatic.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.320]   Tens of thousands of self-proclaimed hackers
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.560]   have volunteered.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.520]   And I just don't even understand how
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.880]   you would assign them jobs and manage them.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.600]   So what you're really asking for is total chaos.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.000]   They'll benefit from it.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.200]   But did you also see Bloomberg actually
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.320]   did a really good story about an employee, I believe,
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.640]   who used to work at Uber, who was Ukrainian.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.440]   And now he's gone over back to Ukraine
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.000]   to manage their supply side and procurement.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.400]   Nice.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.080]   And it was a really interesting story
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.600]   about people who have other skills coming back
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.400]   and trying to help build the infrastructure needed
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.000]   for more based on their experience.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.500]   There you go.
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.080]   You found him.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.560]   Yep.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.400]   This is our equivalent.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:58.960]   Good googling.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.840]   Brad Stone.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.720]   It's a good story.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.960]   It's just courage.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.560]   That's a really nice approach.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.040]   And then, of course, there's the mother and children
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.400]   who were killed who, in Ukraine,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.280]   fleeing the fighting who was, in fact, a controller working
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.360]   for a Silicon Valley tech company remotely.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.840]   So it goes both ways.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.960]   I mean, it really hits all of us.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.880]   And you just want to do something.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.080]   And, you know, of course, we can donate and things like that.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:40.720]   But what can these tech companies do that's appropriate?
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.160]   And this is not going to backfire.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.400]   It's very--
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.240]   And you raised next--
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.240]   a really interesting point, Jeff, which is, whatever you
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.120]   don't do is permission--
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.520]   wherever you don't draw the line is permission.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.280]   And that's terrifying.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.800]   And the same with Polish jets now.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.880]   It is, no, that's too risky.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.240]   OK.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.640]   So now we've acknowledged that line.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.000]   So I'm just going to say this at the end,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.920]   but I'll bring it up now.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.280]   I just finished listening to--
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.480]   where'd it go?
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.520]   The von Neumann biography that's just out.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.520]   Man from the Future, the visionary life of John von Neumann.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.840]   Oh, I don't know what I'm in.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:25.920]   Oh, you like it?
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.120]   You like it a lot.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.720]   Both of you will, I think.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.760]   But of course, he was an arguably
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.560]   v pioneer of game theory.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.680]   And so this thing, Joe, is fascinating.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.560]   In the current context of this is all game theory.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.120]   And are you dealing with someone who's
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.960]   going to make rational, if sick choices in Putin?
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.000]   Yeah, it is game theory.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.680]   It is game theory.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.640]   It's all game theory.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.880]   It's all game theory.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.840]   And it's really interesting to see it
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.800]   then abstracted to that level.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.720]   But you remember all of the game theory stuff
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.320]   that went on with atomic war.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.000]   That's exactly it.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.240]   And oh, wow.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.800]   It seemed like Brinkman's ship in many ways.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.400]   You have to have a lot of faith in game theory.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   I don't know if I have the nerve.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.920]   My brother.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.120]   It's a game of chicken.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.640]   Yeah, my brother texted me.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.600]   He's like, I love you.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   We might die soon.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.200]   And I was like, oh my god.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.080]   Calm down.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.640]   I don't think it's that bad yet.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.400]   I hope no.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.320]   No, although my husband did let me know that just nearby
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.040]   in Bremerton is the largest supply of nuclear bombs
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.680]   in the United States.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.480]   So I was like-- Oh, there's that.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.600]   But you know what?
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.320]   If I'm going to go out in a nuclear explosion,
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.680]   I'd rather be closer than farther.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.920]   Actually, I'm embarrassed to admit I
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.360]   did go to the Nuke map to see.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.800]   Do you know about Nuke map?
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:01.840]   You put in your location, and then you choose what kind of bomb.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.000]   Let's enter a yield, or you could select a preset.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.840]   Let's say, little boy.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.480]   You hear a shimma bomb.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.320]   15 kiloton bomb.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.760]   I've got my pin dropped in New York City.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.720]   So let's just see.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   Well, thanks a lot, Leo.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.920]   Are you safe?
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.400]   You're safe.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   I'm not safe, Jeff.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.120]   You're safe.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.240]   But one of the big stories I did at the examiner
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.160]   in us in San Francisco when I was Sunday editor there,
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.920]   way back when, was Lawrence Livermore Lab
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.920]   had developed the neutron bomb.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.680]   We destroyed the life, but the buildings stay OK.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.200]   It's the real estate bomb.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.200]   And it was developed at Lawrence Livermore, right there near you.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   And so we did the same thing.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.000]   We did maps of the Bay Area, and what would go,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.160]   and it was irresponsible as hell.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.640]   But it was fun.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.720]   You'd published that in the newspaper?
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.360]   Page one.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.440]   That is, I don't know if it's irresponsible.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.560]   It's certainly scary.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.480]   I don't know where-- I mean, you're not going to--
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.280]   I think-- you think Oakland?
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.720]   Well, there's a ship building.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.320]   There's a lot of ship building, but they're not
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.160]   going to try to knock our ships out.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.120]   They're going to try to cause as much paint,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.560]   because it's the wars going to be over in 15 minutes.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:08.920]   They're not silicon.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.400]   I'm not worried about Silicon Valley.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.520]   I'm seeing what's the closest point that might be hit by a bomb.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.760]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.640]   I'm trying-- look, this is kind of nuclear secrecy.com,
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.080]   if you want to have some fun.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.000]   Here's a nuclear weapon tested by North Korea in 2017,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.040]   if we're detonating, saying, yeah, we're still safe.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.120]   We're still safe.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.240]   The fireball radius is that yellow circle.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.640]   Radiation radius is the green.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.920]   Moderate blast damage gray.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.120]   Thermal radiation yellow, and then light blast damage gray.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.920]   Well, then obviously, the device is, the best thing you can do
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.600]   is stay in your home, until the worst of the radiation
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.440]   blows over you.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:00.080]   So the largest bomb ever tested by the USSR
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.600]   is a 100 megaton bomb.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.360]   And even that doesn't quite reach Petaluma.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.680]   They have a few of them, Leo.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.160]   But they're not going to drop a bomb on Petaluma.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.920]   Now, they might not bedminster.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.680]   So if I were-- I'd be nervous.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.800]   And Bremerton is definitely on the list, so anyway.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.200]   It was nice knowing you.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.040]   No.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:23.480]   Thanks.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   So Leo, it's depressing.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.400]   Let's do an old guy's moment here.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.480]   Never did duck and cover.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.680]   Never did duck and cover.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.240]   Never did.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:31.840]   I did.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.640]   We did duck and cover.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.720]   You're kidding me, Stacy.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   You did?
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.800]   Your age?
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.040]   Were you got under the desk?
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.360]   Oh, no, those were tornado jills.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:40.840]   Never mind.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.760]   You also got under the desk.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.280]   But no.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.240]   What apocalypse are another apocalypse?
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.480]   I do remember in my grade school,
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.480]   there were civil defense signs.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:52.840]   Yes.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.400]   And there were bomb shelters.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.200]   There were nuclear bomb shelters.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.800]   And so the civil defense sign-- and there
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.480]   were barrels of water in there.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.520]   So I was aware of it.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.280]   I don't remember ever that duck and cover was the--
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.040]   and that was more in the '50s where they, for some reason,
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.360]   thought you'd be safe under your desk
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.640]   if there were a nuclear war.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.680]   I know, it's absurd.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.080]   It's so magnifically absurd.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.920]   You know, I think this is a way sometimes people deal
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.600]   with the unthinkable is to trivialize it a little bit.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.760]   And so I--
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.400]   Or was that a PR effort to make us more scared than we needed
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:32.720]   to be?
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.640]   Oh, do you think they wanted you to be scared?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.160]   Litigated.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.440]   Yeah, politically.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.840]   Here's a fun little tweet if you want to be scared.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:44.240]   This is Russian police in Moscow stopping people
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.160]   to see what's on their phones.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:47.680]   Just--
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.200]   Very Star Wars, too, in what the rest of the--
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.840]   Yeah, look at how they're dressed.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.240]   They're just randomly, apparently,
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.360]   stopping people and scrolling through their messages
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.920]   to make sure that they're not--
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.120]   That means they have the gloves that have the--
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.480]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.840]   Yeah, capacitive mittens.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.600]   Bastida, thank you.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.520]   Wild.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.120]   I mean, I don't know how widespread this is.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.120]   Obviously, a lot of people are walking by and not being
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   stopped.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.560]   I don't know why they stopped these guys, particularly.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.200]   I don't also know why they're wearing shoulder pads,
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.280]   but maybe it's just more intimidating that way.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.680]   The other funny thing is--
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.040]   And you'll be glad to know this.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.080]   The police are wearing body cameras in Moscow.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.160]   Not to your advantage of sure in any way,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.760]   but they all have body cameras on.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.400]   Wow.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.560]   So what do you think about Twitter doing the tour again?
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.680]   So I think this is what--
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.320]   I would put in your green washing.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.600]   It looks good.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.040]   Not sure what the benefit is.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.720]   So they've launched a service that
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.920]   makes it, in theory, easier to access Twitter, which is--
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.760]   right now, very much curtailed in Russia.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.560]   I don't think they've turned it off,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.080]   but they've slowed it down.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.520]   And they're certainly going through stuff.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.000]   So the idea is to let people in the censored countries
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.600]   access Twitter through tour.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:19.080]   And then this is the long address.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.400]   I'm not going to say it, because it would take me half
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.200]   an hour to read it.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.600]   But there's a long onion--
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.160]   dot onion address.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.040]   You need a tour browser.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.920]   And you can go here.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.800]   And the idea is--
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.320]   which I'm not using, so I'm not getting there.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.520]   The idea is that by going through onion routers,
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.080]   go through many, many, many, many other servers
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.280]   to anonymize your traffic.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.040]   But there is a flaw in tour, which
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.560]   is that it's possible to control the entry or exit
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.760]   nodes in such a way that you're de-anonymizing people.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.600]   Almost certain Russia does that.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.400]   We do it.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:06.640]   So I would not-- if I were worried about my life
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.120]   in an authoritarian regime, I would not use tour.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.880]   I would not assume a tour is private.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.760]   Any more than a VPN is private.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:22.680]   So I think that's kind of a mistake to encourage that.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.320]   So that's one--
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.200]   Do you want to talk about another tech security thing?
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.880]   I think this is actually a really good one.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.480]   Yes.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.280]   It is the Critical Infrastructure Defense Project, which
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:40.200]   is CrowdStrike, CloudFlare, and it's not Royal Pingdom.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:40.880]   It is--
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.960]   Should be somebody with Cloud in their name, though.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.600]   No, it's Ping identity.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.160]   That's it.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.880]   That's who it is.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.960]   They got together.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.000]   So Sisa-- we talked about them last week--
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.920]   they did their shields up document on February 22nd.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.320]   But it was basically like, hey, monitor your stuff.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.360]   We're not being attacked from a cyber perspective yet.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.040]   But here's your best practices you should follow.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.800]   So these three companies got together.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.520]   They teamed up on their various different service offerings
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.360]   and created a free for the next four months set of services
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.120]   that enterprises can use to implement the SISA's shields up
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:18.680]   program.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.440]   Oh, that's great.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.040]   And so--
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.240]   The Critical Infrastructure Defense Project.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   There's a posting here on the CloudFlare describing it.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.320]   CrowdStrike is, by the way, a sponsor.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.480]   So I'm proud of that.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.240]   Good job, CrowdStrike.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.040]   And I think CloudFlare has been a sponsor.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.600]   I don't think they are currently.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.880]   And Ping identity is a third.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.920]   That's really interesting.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.360]   Good for them.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.600]   Yeah, we're talking about all these things that are terrible
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.440]   and we're debating all these moral things.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.720]   And those are worth debating.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.680]   But it's also worth noting that there
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.560]   are actual steps that if you are in IT,
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.600]   you can take and--
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.160]   This is not greenwashing.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.360]   This is absolutely genuine.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.800]   Good stuff, right?
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.920]   Criticalinfrastructuredefense.org is the website.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.880]   Free cybersecurity services and support for four months.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   And this is in response to a potential threat
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.160]   from Russia of cyber warfare, cyber attack.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.960]   Which I will toot my own horn.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.680]   I have a guy coming on my show tomorrow.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.960]   So tomorrow's show.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.880]   We're going to talk about the potential for industrial
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.320]   controls being hacked.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.840]   So infrastructure attacks by Russia
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.800]   as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.520]   And just as a sneak peek, I'm going to tell you that right now
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.480]   it's not happening.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.440]   We don't need to worry about that.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   Which is interesting.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:37.880]   Which is interesting.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.680]   And I'm not sure if that's showing restraint
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.680]   on the part of Russians or if the Ukraine--
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.840]   They're a little busy.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.840]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.800]   Or Ukraine is knowing that Russia's been testing out
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.040]   their cyber warfare capabilities in Ukraine for a decade.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.200]   Maybe they're prepared.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.520]   Maybe they knew this.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.240]   Maybe they're actually pretty hardened.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:57.760]   By the way--
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.920]   I think it's a couple things.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.400]   Go ahead.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.840]   They are-- I mean, in Ukraine, yes.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:06.320]   They've been, yes, taking action.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.640]   But also, I think Russia can't do it in other places
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.920]   because that is going to demand an immediate repercussion.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.760]   If Russia suddenly comes in attacks, our infrastructure,
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.240]   we know they're already in our infrastructure.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.800]   If they do anything with that, especially
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.600]   that leads to loss of life, that's like Pearl Harbor all over again,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.800]   except launch from a computer keyboard.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.280]   Well, we have our cyber warriors.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.800]   They have theirs.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.760]   China has theirs.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.400]   North Korea has theirs.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.680]   Iran has theirs.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.160]   Yeah, but if they do it--
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.280]   I think we want to keep this from getting into a hot cyber war.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.360]   I think that's really a lot of this, too.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.560]   I think also, any sort of cyber attack--
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.480]   it's not going to remain in the digital sphere.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.720]   If they actually blow up one of our dams,
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.200]   we're going to send actual military resources over there.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.160]   That's what I mean.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.480]   It's not going to be us going and hacking them back.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.160]   It's going to be us--
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:03.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.520]   OK.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.280]   You flooded Buffalo, New York.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.000]   We're coming after you now.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.440]   Yeah, but what if you did something less?
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.000]   What if you shut down the power grid?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.280]   And you did it in a way that maybe was not attributable
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   to bad guys from Russia?
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.960]   What if you did that?
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.120]   It would be attributable.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.560]   I mean, we can figure that stuff out pretty well.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.920]   I mean, it might take us a week.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.600]   We're not going to use-- what are we going to do if we do that?
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   See, this is the thing--
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   If they shut down the power grid?
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.840]   How many people die?
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.520]   What are we going to do?
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.160]   Well, if people actually die--
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.520]   OK, let's say people die.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.320]   What do we do?
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.080]   OK.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.320]   If 500 people die, we're going after them.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.520]   I promise we'll send troops.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.000]   We send troops.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.120]   We will send troops over.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   The problem is, how does this not escalate into a nuclear war
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.720]   that will kill hundreds and hundreds of millions?
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.920]   Well, that's why I think Russia is kind of saying,
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.720]   hey, we're not going to deploy this yet.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.120]   That's why we're not there yet.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.520]   So people are worried about it.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.320]   They threatened last week to use nukes.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.920]   And let's hope that maybe cooler heads are prevailing.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.800]   But if Putin is nihilistic at this point,
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.520]   I think there's a real danger in the next few months,
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.240]   if it does not go well for Russia,
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.920]   that they will start doing things that are--
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.920]   The other thing is going to happen.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.400]   --security of the entire world.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:18.920]   Yes.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.800]   And I think the other thing that's going to happen is,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.360]   I follow very closely, oddly, Finland and Sweden.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.240]   I was so fascinated by this.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.680]   And thanks to the very good Google translate, I can do that.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.840]   And they're inching closer and closer and closer
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.080]   to Jordan and NATO.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.080]   They're terrified.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.400]   They're right on the border.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:40.280]   And the fear is, if Russia succeeds in Ukraine, who's next?
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:40.800]   Exactly.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.680]   So in Finland, literally, people are calling and saying,
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.880]   if it happens, where am I going to be called up to?
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.080]   And where do I volunteer?
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.600]   And stuff like that.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.680]   So that's going to freak him out.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.080]   That's going to piss him off.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.000]   He considers that a hostile act.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.200]   But they need a protection.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.240]   And then we're on the hook to protect them.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.280]   But I go back to my post.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.320]   If he goes into tax Finland, OK, we stand back again.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.640]   If he uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, we stand back.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.480]   Is there no other line besides crossing the NATO bridge?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.440]   And nukes.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.840]   Is that it?
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.120]   I don't know.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.680]   Patrick Bejia, who's been on our show many times,
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.560]   is a podcaster who lives in Helsinki,
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:33.760]   had a long Twitter thread about just his own anecdotal stories
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.240]   of what's going on in Finland right now.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.320]   I found it very, very interesting.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.440]   Let's go to the very top here.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.680]   The view from Finland.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:51.480]   I don't know.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.040]   It's complicated.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.320]   I'm not going to read it to you.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.200]   But it's because there's like 20 tweets.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.160]   But Russians have always been torn between the reality
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.680]   of their TV and the reality of their fridge, which
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.680]   relates to sanctions, whatever Finnish authorities
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.600]   thinking about right now.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.960]   They're starting to look at decades old plans
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.560]   for handling hundreds of thousands of refugees,
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.640]   not from Ukraine, from Russia.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.920]   Trains and buses from St. Petersburg have been full for days.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.600]   And with the Russian economy about to collapse,
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.360]   things aren't going to get better.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.280]   Finland has a population of 5 million.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.120]   That's St. Petersburg alone.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.120]   And they're just over--
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.560]   That's half the size of New Jersey's population.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.160]   So there's--
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.400]   I saw a video of people at the train station in Finland
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.880]   saying, we had to get out.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   We'll go anywhere.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:47.360]   I don't want to make this the--
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.320]   No.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.600]   This weekend--
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   This weekend, Russia's--
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.120]   You can't ignore it.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.160]   This weekend, World War III.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.600]   Yes.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.880]   I started putting stuff in the rundown.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.520]   And I didn't know what your decision was going to be.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.000]   So I put it together down at the bottom and other.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.600]   It'll sadly get there where it is kind of other.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.720]   But we can't not ignore it for a while.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.360]   My happy place in the world, my happy place on Twitter
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.720]   is my book history walks Twitter list, which I go to
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.080]   when all else fails me.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.760]   Gutenberg and such.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.360]   And it's all Ukraine now, of course,
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.640]   because these are human beings, all concerned for the world,
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.760]   and everything is Ukraine now, everything,
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.920]   as it should be right now.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:31.600]   Well, even if it's not, and you have moments of forgetfulness,
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.400]   which happens on our shows all the time,
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:38.200]   and then it just floods back in on you shortly thereafter.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.720]   Last week, you did a hell of a lot of stories on the topic.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.720]   Yeah, we're going to-- I think we've done enough.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.560]   We have plenty of other things we can talk about.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.840]   Our hearts and the minds are going to be--
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.320]   Do you want to talk about Google by Mandian as part of this,
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.600]   or is that-- I mean, it kind of could go here or elsewhere?
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.240]   That's not related to Russia, isn't it?
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.200]   It's just cybersecurity.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.480]   Yeah, we're going to get to that.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.600]   Definitely.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.040]   Definitely.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.600]   I would call that not a Ukraine story.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.840]   So if there's certainly cybersecurity,
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.160]   it's going to be part of what we--
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:14.840]   Google makes the pitch that it's more important now than ever.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.560]   They've been talking with Mandian since before in the war.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.360]   So everybody's talking about Mandian.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.160]   The reason I know this is Mandian talked to us
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.600]   about advertising about a month ago, and then said,
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.240]   "Hold up."
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.320]   "Hold up on that advertising thing there for just a minute,
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.000]   and now I think I know why."
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.760]   Our show today brought to you by Streak.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.920]   Look, if you're using Gmail, you should be using Streak
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.560]   as a startup founder and entrepreneur, just a busy person.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.440]   You probably live in your inbox--
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.200]   tracking sales, tracking fundraising, hiring,
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.160]   supporting your users.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:00.600]   Streak, STREAK, is a CRM that'll help you stay on top
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.320]   of all your processes without even leaving Gmail.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   Use Streak's free email tools to check if your emails have
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.000]   been opened.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.680]   You can even send bulk emails with automated follow-up emails
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.320]   to improve your response rates.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.240]   And yes, Google loves Streak.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   They don't just tolerate him.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.920]   It was recognized as Google's technology partner of the year
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.120]   is used by thousands of founders and entrepreneurs
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.200]   and small business owners.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.120]   It's built right inside of Gmail.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.280]   So it's part of your everyday workflow.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.680]   And it all comes down to these pipelines, which are so cool.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   You create pipelines to track what you're doing all your processes
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.840]   directly within Gmail, whether you're
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.000]   prospecting for new customers or raising a fundraising round,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.080]   create a pipeline.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.320]   Growing your team, create a pipeline, managing support
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.080]   tickets, create a pipeline.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.600]   You don't have to leave Gmail.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.560]   Everything's in there makes it easy to collaborate
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.520]   by automatically sharing emails and notes
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.920]   with anyone on your team.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.880]   Look, it does so much.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.560]   It's so powerful.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.680]   And it's so easy to use.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.360]   I say, if I tell you all the things it does,
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.400]   you're going to say that's hard to use.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.720]   If I don't, then you're going to say, well, it doesn't do enough.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.040]   It does everything you want.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.000]   And it's easy to use.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:08.560]   How about that?
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.360]   But you've got to try it.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.600]   That's the only way.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.720]   That's the only way.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.320]   And the good news is it's free to use on your own.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.280]   You could try Streak out today for free on your own.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.560]   If you feel like it's doing the job, get the pro plan.

[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.760]   And that way we get credit.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   So that's because what comes around goes around.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   President Biden has signed an executive order
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.760]   that the crypto boys are going excited or all over about.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.760]   They're so excited.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   I'm not sure why they're excited, but I guess it's at least
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.760]   acknowledgment that crypto exists yesterday.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   They signed an executive order emphasizing this as
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   for vice the US government's commitment to ensuring that
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.760]   virtual assets are developed responsibly and for shadows,
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   the development of a digital dollar.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.760]   Do you want to make them happy or unhappy?
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   Make them happy.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.760]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.760]   So Rich Dad, poor dad guy who I didn't know was a Trumpian
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.760]   off the rails.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.760]   He was going all-- they're going to destroy crypto.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.760]   They're going to take it all over.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.760]   They're going to make it one federal dollar.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   And I don't know why I'm quoting him because he's nuts.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   But--
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.760]   Well, see, that's the thing.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   There's that extreme part of this.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.760]   Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure I buy the interpretation.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   This is good news because you're right.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   All it's saying is we're going to look more into this.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.760]   But everybody I read said, oh, no, this is great.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   Vice says industry insiders appear to welcome the executive
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.760]   order, which was expected to be essentially positive on
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.760]   cryptocurrencies.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.760]   This is Jerry Brito, director of a DC based think tank coin
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   center.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.760]   He tweeted, the message I take from this--
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.760]   I guess what kinds of coins-- the message I take from this
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   executive order is that the federal government sees
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   cryptocurrency as a legitimate, serious, and important part
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.760]   of the economy and society.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.760]   I think it's a good signal to serious people who've been
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   holding back from getting involved.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:37.760]   One of the things I think people like Jerry are saying is we
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   needed guidance from the feds about this or nobody would take
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   it seriously.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   If they're going to do things, they got-- at least we'll
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:49.760]   know what the roadmap is.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.760]   They're validating the technology.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   They're saying, hey, this is a thing worth looking at
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   because we think it's a real thing.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   And when the federal government does that, that's a key.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.760]   I mean, even if they come in and squash it, at least they've
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.760]   said, OK, I mean, the next step is going to be like not
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:07.760]   squashing it.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   But if they come in and say, OK, we're looking at this, then
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.760]   everybody else is like, oh, well, the federal government's
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.760]   going to look at it.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.760]   We'll take a look at it.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.760]   Well, it's partly there, but it's also just we need some
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.760]   certain effect.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.760]   There was a cryptocurrency exchange, one of our sponsors
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:30.760]   actually, that was fined a lot of money by the SEC, but
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.760]   welcomed it because they said, look, you know, we'll pay the
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.760]   fine fine.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.760]   What we wanted was clarification.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.760]   They've never said, are these securities?
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.760]   You know, what are these?
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.760]   So the FCC fine essentially said, yeah, if you're trading
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   crypto futures or whatever it was, that's a security and we're
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   going to treat it like a security.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   OK, so they actually, as bad as it is to get fined, welcomed it
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   because now we know what the rules are.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760]   And this is a problem.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.760]   That's what's going to make it hard for it to mature and to get
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.760]   people invested in it is the uncertainty of knowing how the
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.760]   feds are going to come down.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.760]   So even if they come down potentially badly, at least we'll
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   know.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.760]   We need to know.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.760]   And I think that if there is a digital dollar, there are people
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.760]   who would say that's a terrible thing, probably the rich
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:21.760]   dad poured that guy because, of course, that means maybe no
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   more anonymity and the government's snooping on transactions.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   They're really right now.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   There is really only one completely private transaction.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.760]   That's cash unmarked bills.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.760]   Well, the other thing is that is that the reputation of
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.760]   crypto keeps getting worse and worse.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   And a whole bunch of crypto stuff down under other than the one
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   of which is $100,000, $4 million crypto fraud operation with a
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.760]   brother and sister.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:49.760]   That kind of stuff goes on.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   It hurts the reputation of safety of the entire field.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   That's right.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   If they want to make this broad.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.760]   Same thing with NFTs.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.760]   There's all sorts of scams.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.760]   And if I saw somewhere 80% of NFTs are scams.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   So this needs, it has to stop being the Wild West.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.760]   And yeah, if you're Wyatt Earp, you might say, oh, man, I'm
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   going to miss those good old days.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:18.760]   But there's no future if you don't get, if you don't get
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   some certainty on this.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   I would find it useful.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   I don't know if you agree or not.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760]   Because this is not a democracy.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.760]   It only matters if you do to almost discuss crypto a little more
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.760]   often on the show just because it's such an important crypto
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   and watching.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.760]   Okay.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   Well, all right.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.760]   That was that.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   Who was that?
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.760]   That was the pain noise.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.760]   Oh, my God.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.760]   That was a big.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   I know.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   Some animal was, you know, I think we should.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.760]   Can I get my ringtone, please?
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   Look, we are.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.760]   I am not.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.760]   Wow.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   I am increasingly skeptical of all of this stuff.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   In fact, that's why it's interesting.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   The architecture has potential to do.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   I'm not saying there's not some interesting stuff and blockchain
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   obviously has some applications.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   It's a decentralized ledger.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   That's great.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:14.760]   But as it's been implemented through cryptocurrencies and now NFTs
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:21.760]   and DAOs, it almost always seems to be at best speculative and at
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   worst a scam.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:31.760]   And so I'm very, very bearish on cryptocurrency in general and
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.760]   I'm not sure if you're in general.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   But yes, Stacey, and that's why Stacey made that noise.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.760]   I'm sure she feels the same way.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   She doesn't want this to be the crypto bro show.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.760]   I do not.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   I will.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   I will abandon ship, but I bring up things that.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   Correct.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   No crypto for us.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   That is a.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   That is not a thing.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   It's just a legitimate like nope.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   No, you wouldn't.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.760]   I'll hear you wouldn't.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.760]   But God.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   I promise to y'all because I follow a lot of this because
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.760]   I do think the blockchain is important for
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.760]   establishing trust.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.760]   Trust and authenticity in IOT.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.760]   I get a lot of interesting pitches around data.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   I will bring those to you.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.760]   And I will say, Hey, look, this is actually pretty legit.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.760]   This is pretty cool.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.760]   I've done it in the past.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.760]   I'll continue doing it, but we don't have to talk a lot about
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.760]   any of these are cryptocurrencies.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.760]   Look, it's not blockchains legit, but it's not about blockchain.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   Otherwise, people would be all excited about MongoDB or, you know,
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   the latest Yuba key.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.760]   It's it's it's if it were just a decentralized ledger database
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.760]   application by itself.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   No one would want to talk about it.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   They want to talk about it because of the huge amounts of money
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:52.760]   that can be made speculating on currencies that are created by using
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   that technology now.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.760]   So we could talk about blockchain, but I think blockchain is
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.760]   blockchain absent.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:02.760]   All of that stuff is about as interesting as talking about
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.760]   Hadoop.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.760]   It's just not.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.760]   It's not distributed.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.760]   No, but I'm saying it's a technology.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.760]   There's lots of technologies out there.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   Well, this is the is the use.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   We never we don't spend hours talking about public key crypto.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   Yes, hugely important, valuable because it was never tied to a
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   $60,000 instrument.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   Nobody cares about it.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   So we talk about all of that stuff all of the time.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.760]   I'm just saying that saying it's a good technology is not why
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.760]   people are talking about it.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.760]   It's not why it's interesting.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.760]   Right.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   Well, I'll bring you the use cases that are.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.760]   Yeah, there's great.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.760]   There's great uses cases for public key crypto too, but that
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.760]   doesn't.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.760]   That's just technology.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.760]   That's not why there's all this tension.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.760]   And by the way, every time I say this and I will get it today,
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.760]   I'll get emails and tweets saying, okay, boomer, but.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.760]   And I think Larry David isn't far off on all of this.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.760]   Let's just let's just let's just put it that way.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   There are lots of good.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   I want to say that I am not a boomer.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.760]   Right.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.760]   But we need to be interested to do your gen X or we did not.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:13.760]   We did not spend hours talking about RSA encryption as useful
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.760]   and positive and beneficial as it is.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.760]   The reason we spend all that time talking about blockchain is not
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   because it's a great technology and a distributed ledger.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.760]   Well, it's a simple rule.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   It's a simple rule.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.760]   It's a sarantice.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.760]   Didn't say I need to find a new useful print.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   He said, I want to invent something new and it was an awful.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.760]   I want to create the novel.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   People talk about print a lot more than they talk about blockchain.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.760]   I was going to say, so if we bring up a lot of blockchain issues,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.760]   are we just going to be toting it with knows?
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.760]   Oh, very good.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.760]   Very good.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   Very good.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   All right.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   All right.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   What else we got to talk about?
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:58.760]   Have we done all the blockchain we wanted to do?
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.760]   No, I'm like.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.760]   Let's see.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.760]   Well, I found this fascinating.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   I found this interesting.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.760]   The Islamic debate over the permissibility of crypto because in
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   Islam, because they don't allow usury, not usury.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.760]   Right.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.760]   There's a there's a there's a there's a there's a Talmudic to misuse it.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   A debate going on.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.760]   It's ironic.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   Thank you.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   It's much better.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.760]   Yes.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.760]   A koranic discussion about whether or not buying in a blockchain is a
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:34.760]   form of usury or is it just something that develops and builds
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.760]   value.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   And it's interesting how you take these things and people have to
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   adapt them into their own norms and structures.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.760]   So that's just worth mentioning.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.760]   They call it.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   Is it Sharia?
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   Sharia.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.760]   Sharia.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   Sharia finances.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:52.760]   What I've heard it used her called if you want to give it the
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.760]   in not Talmudic, but it's Sharia.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   If you want to give it the proper.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:03.760]   But God has permitted trade as and forbidden usury.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   So is it trade or is it usury?
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   I would say it's closer to trade than usury.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   Usury is borrowing for interest.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   Well, I would say gas is usury.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   Just because it's usory as gas prices doesn't make it usury.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   Right.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.760]   Everyone's complaining about gas prices.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   Yes, they're high, but good.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   You say that as a Tesla driver.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   I say no, there's two reasons.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.760]   It's because I've traveled frequently enough in Europe that
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.760]   I'm like our gas prices are nothing.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   I met Ethereum gas.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   Oh, I thought you meant get.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.760]   I met Ethereum.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.760]   No, see, I talked about price per gallon.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.760]   I thought you were getting off on some weird old man's engine.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.760]   It was like, oh, come on, yeah.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:46.760]   That's not really that.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.760]   What's all this about?
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   Six dollars a gallon.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.760]   No, we're not doing it.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   Those gas prices.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:58.760]   This is a technology show for God's sakes.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   It was so confused.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   It's not been beyond you in the past to bring up non-technology
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:10.760]   rip-headed stories like Cervantes and the novel.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   That's legit.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   That's legit.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.760]   It was technology back then.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.760]   No, it was a point.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   Yes.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.760]   Yes.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   In its day, it was technology.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.760]   Technology is anything that wasn't invented when you were born.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.760]   That's my definition.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.760]   So Microsoft's purchase of technology is a great thing.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   The purchase of nuance just closed with the EU finally can close
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:42.760]   after 11 months of regulatory scrutiny.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:47.760]   That's why the Mandiant thing, while interesting, doesn't, you know,
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.760]   we always get the headline, Google to acquire Mandiant for $0.5
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   billion deal, but we don't really mention.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   And that may go through in a year after all the regulators get a
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.760]   hold of it.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:05.760]   And Corey Doctorow is very quick to point out some very good news,
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   I think, on Sunday on Twitter that with Lena Khan running the
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.760]   FTC and Tim Wu in the White House as an advisor, we've got some
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:22.760]   very strong antitrust proponents with the year of the
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   president and with the administration.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.760]   And this may in fact not be a very good time to make big deals.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.760]   This would be the second largest history, a deal in history for
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.760]   Alphabet.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   Trying to think of what the largest would be.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.760]   Was it Android maybe?
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.760]   5.4 billion.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.760]   Mandiant is a cybersecurity, cybersecurity company.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.760]   They had FireEye.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   They bought FireEye.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   So they, for a while, they were called FireEye, but that Mandiant
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   FireEye are now just Mandiant.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:01.760]   They publish reports about, we often quote their reports about
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.760]   cyber campaigns.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:08.760]   They are often the ones that identify nation states as involved.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.760]   And in fact, the US intelligence agencies apparently,
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.760]   like the Wall Street Journal, rely on insights provided by Mandiant.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.760]   Oh, you want to know the biggest acquisition?
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   Motorola mobility for 12.5 billion.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   Wow.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   How much was YouTube?
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.760]   It was like a billion three or something.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   1.65.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.760]   Yeah, it was nothing.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.760]   5.4 billion.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.760]   Why would Google, Google want a cybersecurity company, I guess
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.760]   is the question.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   They need something to differentiate their cloud products.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   It gives them, and if you think about it, Microsoft has a
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.760]   huge cybersecurity business.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.760]   They have their whole forensic.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.760]   Google has Project Zero and, you know, Travis Armandee and they
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.760]   have a very good security group.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.760]   They may just be looking at it as the next big thing you need to
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.760]   have to be a cloud or a service, an infrastructure provider,
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.760]   even.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.760]   I don't know.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   They, I mean, Microsoft was trying to buy it.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.760]   Wasn't it?
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:20.760]   Aren't they?
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.760]   Wall Street Journal talked to a cybersecurity analyst at the
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.760]   Bank Needham Group, Alex Henderson, who said it's not a
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.760]   great fit, in my opinion.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.760]   The acquisition will test the degree to which Google can use
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.760]   Mandians consulting services.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.760]   That's their business, by the way, to sell automated cybersecurity
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.760]   tools tailored to cloud-only environments.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.760]   He said the deal will put Google into more direct competition
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.760]   and Microsoft, as you said, Stacey.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.760]   Annual revenue for Microsoft security, business 15
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:51.760]   billion.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:56.760]   This is big business.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:57.760]   Oh.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   But does Google want to become a security consultant?
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.760]   That's the business.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.760]   I think it's become so much more relevant.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   What we're seeing happen, especially with the digital
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.760]   transformation, is that a lot of companies are trying to go get
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:19.760]   all of their infrastructure and tech expertise in just a few
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.760]   places.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.760]   So if you have that consultancy and can offer it, then you can
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.760]   just go all in on Google, right?
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.760]   You don't have to be here.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.760]   The journal says Mandian is often called by a company once they
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.760]   realize they've been hacked to mop up.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.760]   Yes, they're.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   And you're at why and how and how not to do it again.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.760]   Behind every single hack is a phone call to Mandian.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:41.760]   I'm not kidding.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:46.760]   Anytime you see like colonial pipeline, any of these, they
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.760]   call me.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.760]   No, it's a very well known name.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.760]   So is so that's the question.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   Does Google want to have this as a business and they charge and
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.760]   this is you call Google Mandian and they come in or do they want
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.760]   to offer this as value add to their existing cloud business?
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.760]   I assume they'll start just by owning it and offering it.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.760]   And then they'll look for ways to integrate it.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:09.760]   They're smart.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   They'll leave it enough alone for a while and then start to bring
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:19.760]   what they can in house additive to their own stuff is my case.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:24.760]   Stacy, you're you're you're inspiring a question.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   Isn't this like a transitional point as as what IBM went through?
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   Right.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.760]   Well, we we we make computers and then they became a consulting
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:33.760]   company.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:38.760]   And when we offer hosting, but we need to offer a whole set of
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:42.760]   services and you know, I wouldn't, you know, this Google, it's
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:46.760]   a boy by top seven accounting firm, you know, they become a business
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.760]   consultant.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.760]   That's the it seems like it's on the order of that, right?
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.760]   It's by that capability.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.760]   You're you're right.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:57.760]   I'm trying to think of any other business that Google has that is,
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.760]   I mean, because everything else is pretty much automated, even all
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   their ad stuff.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.760]   The only is that that would be the only place I'm not familiar enough
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.760]   with.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   You don't bring in Google consultants to help set up your company
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.760]   network or to move you to the club.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   Maybe you do.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   Maybe that's you.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.760]   That's the new thing.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:14.760]   Maybe that's that's the way they can grow versus Amazon or maybe
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.760]   they see it as something they can productize.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.760]   Maybe in two years, they'll be like, all right, we've learned
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.760]   everything we can from these consultants.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.760]   And now we've turned it into an AI service.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   Do you think that part of this comes from the fact that Google's
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.760]   looking into the fact that there are a week third in cloud, it's
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:36.760]   Amazon, it's Microsoft, and then everybody else.
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:37.760]   Yes.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.760]   Microsoft is a consulting company too, isn't it?
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.760]   Right.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   Google's got to come and Amazon is not.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.760]   So the only way Google's going to keep up, I think, is by adding
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.760]   those kind of product lines.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:52.760]   It's there.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.760]   It's what they need to do if they want, if they're serious about
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:57.760]   being in the cloud, they need to do something, right?
[00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.760]   That makes sense.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.760]   Well, the cloud is the new mainframe, right?
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.760]   If you take the IBM example, then that's where you end up going.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:10.760]   A thousand people in the cloud business, just their souls just
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.760]   curdled.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.760]   I know exactly.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.760]   Oh, exactly.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.760]   I love it.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.760]   I kind of like, I love the heresy of it.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:17.760]   I don't know enough.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.760]   Maybe somebody in our chat room or our Discord is more familiar with
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.760]   cloud providers and so forth.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.760]   But what does Amazon offer along these lines?
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.760]   Amazon have a security consultancy.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.760]   What do they do?
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.760]   They don't have a security consultancy to mine.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.760]   I mean, they have over 200 something odd cloud products.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.760]   So there may be like a secret one that I'm not aware of.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.760]   They have started in the IoT side to get the more sophisticated
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.760]   because like Amazon has historically been seen as like more basic
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.760]   infrastructure or infrastructure for startups and such.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.760]   Microsoft and that's why there's such a big player in the cloud is
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   because the established big companies go to Microsoft, right?
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.760]   So to get some of that business over as part of like the big
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.760]   company is doing digital transformations, Amazon has started to
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.760]   add some consulting around like data analysis and predictive
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.760]   maintenance and optimizing your cloud infrastructure for some of
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.760]   this, but they don't have anything to my knowledge on the
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   security side.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.760]   No, in fact, I'm looking at a list of Amazon security tools for AWS
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.760]   and almost all of them are completely automated.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.760]   They're just it's just software running in the background, you
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.760]   know, that will tell you Amazon inspector a security assessment
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:37.760]   service for applications deployed on AC to AWS shield fully
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.760]   managed distributed knowledge service protection.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.760]   Denial, yeah, DDoS protection service.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.760]   I think we actually use shield web application firewall, all
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   that stuff.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.760]   This is all software.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.760]   So they on they, they mustn't, that's interesting.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.760]   And yet they're number one.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.760]   So maybe you don't need that.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.760]   Yeah, but they're they're not number like it's not mutually
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.760]   exclusive to buy it, put your infrastructure on Amazon and then
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   use Microsoft security stuff.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.760]   So that's another thought process.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.760]   Google is not doing a bang up job being this awesome cloud service
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.760]   provider.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.760]   It's number three, right?
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.760]   Distant number three.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.760]   What if it can then come in and say, oh, I'm going to offer a
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.760]   security service that competes more with Microsoft, but you could
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   be an Amazon customer and maybe I'll make it more googly feeling
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.760]   more developer friendly than maybe a Microsoft option.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.760]   Right before the story broke, Mandia actually put out a
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.760]   report saying that the political, I'm sorry, the prolific
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:42.760]   Chinese hacking group at app 41 APT 41 had compromised multiple
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:46.760]   US state government networks.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.760]   This is according to Mandia, the group conducted a months long
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.760]   campaign during which it targeted and successfully breached at
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.760]   least six US state networks, all of which have been notified by
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:04.760]   Mandia, but they did not publish which states.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.760]   It's interesting.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.760]   You want to know how the hack happened?
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.760]   There is a software application offered, I think by the
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.760]   Ag Department widely used in many states called USA Herds.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   It's an animal health management tool and it used log for shell.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   No, it was vulnerable to log for shell between according to Mandia
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.760]   between May 2021 and February of last month of this year.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:40.760]   At 41 used vulnerable internet facing web applications to gain a
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.760]   foothold into state networks, including exploiting a zero day
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.760]   in USA Herds and the log for J logging library.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.760]   Mandia said app 41 began exploiting log for shell within
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:59.760]   hours of the vulnerability being announced in December of last
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760]   year.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760]   So there you go.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.760]   As soon as there's this closure, you are vulnerable.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.760]   Led to the compromise of two US state government networks and
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.760]   other targets in the insurance and telecoms industries.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.760]   After gaining that foothold on the network, app 41 went on to
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.760]   perform extensive credential collection, which I guess got them
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.760]   into the other networks.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.760]   In one instance, they used a sequel injection vulnerability in
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760]   a proprietary web app.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.760]   Wow.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   So this is nation state hackers.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.760]   This is China.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.760]   I'm sure Russia is doing the same thing.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:44.760]   But one of the things Mandia said is while everybody's looking
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   over at Russia, don't forget there are other major threat
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.760]   actors continuing operations as usual.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.760]   Yikes.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.760]   One more second.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:04.760]   I'm trying to think as a brand.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.760]   Who would you more likely call for consulting if they had the
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760]   arms?
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.760]   Google or Amazon?
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.760]   Those are really terrible options.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.760]   You might call IBM or HP or --
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.760]   Microsoft.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.760]   Microsoft.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.760]   That is the essence of this.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.760]   You inspired it.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.760]   Stacey and Leo.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.760]   They may see that it's the missing piece they have to have.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.760]   Who are you going to call?
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.760]   All right.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.760]   Stacey on IOT story.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:49.760]   Researchers find potentially vulnerable smart home devices.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.760]   They have vulnerabilities.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   Tell us about it.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.760]   Stacey.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.760]   Where is the Stacey.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.760]   If Stacey were a nickname for a longer name.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.760]   It's a nickname for Anastasia.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.760]   Is that your name?
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.760]   My name is Stacey.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:18.760]   I was born smack in the Stacey era.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.760]   I'm going to call you that from now on.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.760]   Is that Stacey?
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.760]   Is the nickname for Anastasia?
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.760]   That's interesting.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.760]   Anastasia Higgenboffum.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.760]   That's a lot of stuff.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.760]   That's your not-less name.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.760]   Anastasia Higgenboffum.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.760]   Anastasia W Higgenboffum.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.760]   I do enjoy those murder mysteries by Anastasia W Higgenboffum.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.760]   I shall keep that in the back burner for when I do my crime
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.760]   series.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   Are you going to do what I hope you do?
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:59.760]   By the way, speaking of which Stacey does do the Stacey book club in our Discord and the next book is Corey Dr. O's on authorized bread.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   I told Corey he was very thrilled that you're going to do that.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.760]   So that's neat.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.760]   That's neat.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.760]   John's reading it right now says it's great.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.760]   It's about a toaster.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   We don't take bad books.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.760]   Toaster DRM, baby.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.760]   Yes.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.760]   An authorized bread.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:23.760]   That'll be a club twit event coming up when soon, yes?
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   It's the 24th, actually.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.760]   Oh, just a couple of weeks.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:33.760]   And I will tell you the time as I pull my calendar up, oh, it is 9 a.m.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   9 a.m.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:42.760]   So just so's your nose, Paul Therat will be doing a fireside chat on March 31st.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:47.760]   We got Stacey's book club, the untitled Linux club, Linux show.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.760]   These are all things that happen inside the club.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   It's an amazing club.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.760]   It's really taken off.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.760]   Thanks to Ant.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.760]   I should have mentioned Ant's not here because it's his birthday.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.760]   Happy birthday, Ant.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.760]   Happy birthday, Ant.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.760]   And we know we don't know how old he is.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.760]   We don't know.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.760]   We want to know, but we don't.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.760]   He told us all to do five squats before breakfast before lunch.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.760]   Five I could do.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.760]   Five I could do anyway.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.760]   Well, yeah, you just got to start.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.760]   Yeah, just got to start somewhere.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.760]   Thank you, Ant, for doing all of these great events and for doing the book club and everything.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   And if you are not a member of club twit, that isn't even the main...
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.760]   That's not even the main show.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.760]   The main deal is ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.760]   We thought that this court will just be, we'll throw something in for fun.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.760]   It turned out to be a fabulous place to talk about everything,
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.760]   not just the shows, but all sorts of topics that geeks are interested in.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.760]   It goes, the list goes on and on.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.760]   Even support ball.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.760]   If you're not a member, $7 a month gets you those ad-free shows,
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:55.760]   access to the Discord, the Twit Plus feed, all the extra shows we do inside the club are on that feed.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.760]   Just go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.760]   Please join club twit.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.760]   It really helps keep the lights on here at Twit Central.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.760]   Twit Party Central.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:16.760]   So, oh, Patrick Delahanty is going to be also doing a fireside chat.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.760]   He is our engineer.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.760]   If you want to know how all this stuff runs, he's the guy who does that.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   That's March 17th, St. Patrick's Day.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.760]   March 24th for the book club, March 31st for Paul Therat's AMA.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.760]   So, it's a very busy March in club twit.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.760]   How exciting.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.760]   Let's take a little break and we'll have more.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.760]   Were we starting to talk about something before that?
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.760]   Yes.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.760]   Potentially.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.760]   Forget that article.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.760]   Forget that article.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.760]   To summarize it.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.760]   Somehow Anastasia Higginbotham got me off on a tangent.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.760]   So, which of my alter ego does?
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.760]   Yes.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.760]   Okay.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.760]   What?
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.760]   Three years ago, a bunch of researchers launched something called IoT Inspector.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.760]   If you downloaded it.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.760]   We talked about that when it came out.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:10.760]   We did.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.760]   And if you downloaded it, it tracked the behavior of smart devices in your home.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.760]   And about 5,000 people downloaded it.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.760]   They got about a huge database, about 50,000 devices behaving in the wild.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.760]   So, this is the upshot of that.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   We talked about getting it and using it.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   And what are the results?
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.760]   Well, we know so.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.760]   I mean, they're using this pool of data for other research, but this particular research,
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.760]   they looked at it and they said, "Oh, holy cow.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   A lot of these devices are behaving in ways that devices that use older, vulnerable versions
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.760]   of OpenSSL are behaving."
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:54.760]   So, they can't say that these 32 Amazon devices, these 22 Samsung devices, and the list goes
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:59.760]   on, are actually using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL because they don't actually know
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760]   what versions they're using.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.760]   This isn't information that's available.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.760]   But they do behave like vulnerable versions.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   And some of these vulnerabilities, they're allowed for remote code execution.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:19.760]   And the idea here is they didn't do this to be like, "Gotcha."
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:27.240]   They did it because they're trying to figure out how we make IoT devices transparent and
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:35.000]   secure in the way that we try to make web browsing transparent and secure using public
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   key encryption.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.760]   So, public key infrastructure.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.760]   So, yeah, this is...
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:44.800]   Is it going to require the hardware manufacturers to step up as much as any sort of...
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.680]   So, hardware manufacturers are already stepping up.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.680]   They're doing...
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:55.640]   Like, most of these companies, not all, but most of them are starting with secure by design.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.840]   They're also starting programs for defense and depth in all the good buzzwords.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:06.520]   But what happens is maybe they don't update everything, maybe they're just not on top
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.160]   of something, and nobody knows.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.680]   The other thing is, like, we have certificate authorities on the web.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:17.400]   I didn't realize this, but some companies issue their own IoT device certificates.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   They don't even have it.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   Oh, self-signed.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.400]   Yeah, that's not good.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   So, everything's self-signed.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.640]   So, they're basically...
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:30.360]   This is basically just them saying, like, "Look, this is an immature ecosystem.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.240]   We need to make it more secure.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.240]   What are the...
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.840]   Let's open up conversations on how we can do this."
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.840]   This chart is interesting.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.400]   You have this in your blog post.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.040]   It's Stacy on IoT.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:47.240]   The number of days that companies ran outdated versions of OpenSSL after, I guess, it was
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   heartbleed.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.800]   It was after the heartbleed vulnerability.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.640]   There's whatever the SSL vulnerability was.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.240]   And some waited a long time.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.240]   LG, look here.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.240]   LG between a thousand and a two thousand days.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.760]   Who was the fastest?
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.760]   Samsung was pretty quick.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:07.960]   Synology was pretty quick.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.960]   Glad to hear that.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.200]   That's what I use QNAP, another network attached storage was probably the quickest.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.160]   Amazon patched a lot of stuff, but not all this stuff.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:25.120]   And some of this could be indications of little devices they sold a few of and then discontinued.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.520]   So they're just not thinking about it.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.280]   A lot of these are smart TVs.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.760]   If you look at these devices, a lot of them look like media storage or smart TVs.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:38.680]   And those are notorious for being kind of...
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.680]   Is what I'll go with.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.680]   The biggest range and maybe it's a measure of how many devices they offer is Google, which
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:53.760]   patched some of its devices within just a few days and took several years to patch the
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   rest of them.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.760]   How many?
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.760]   Just two.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.320]   Google only has two devices that were behaving weirdly.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.920]   Okay, so explain this graph.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.920]   So they're looking...
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.920]   Yeah, it's a complicated...
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.920]   I was like...
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.920]   There's a...
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:12.200]   The devices, the number of devices that are affected are in parentheses.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.360]   Oh, there they are too.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.240]   I see, I see.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.240]   I see.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.240]   Okay.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.440]   Amazon had to give you some sense.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.800]   32 devices that were affected.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.520]   That's device lines, I guess we should say Samsung 22 device lines.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.520]   So wow.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.520]   Wow.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:35.160]   So they're going to continue using this pool of data for other research.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:40.640]   So I note in there if you want to, it's not something you should run all the time because
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:45.400]   it does kind of slow down your internet speeds because it's using deep packet inspection.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.160]   But running it occasionally and having it...
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.160]   Really valuable.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:56.600]   Thanks to those of you who did that so that we can see some of this information.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.960]   There is an attack on Amazon's Echo devices.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:14:59.960]   It's a little bit...
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.960]   You know, I was thinking about...
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:01.960]   How could this be on?
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:02.960]   This is...
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:03.960]   Okay, but wait a minute.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:09.800]   What works is you have to be within range of the Echo so that you can shout pair with
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800]   my phone.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.000]   What's the thing that can happen to an Echo?
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.800]   Well, once my phone is paired to your device, then I have control of the device.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.960]   Do what?
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:22.960]   To give you the wrong weather?
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.960]   Do you tell it?
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.400]   Well, no, to tell you to unlock the doors or something.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.800]   This is a stupid attack.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.800]   Well, okay.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.800]   I thought it was.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.800]   Then I thought about it.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.520]   You know who should worry about this?
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.280]   People in apartments with thin walls.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.280]   Yes.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.280]   That's what I was thinking.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:42.120]   This is something for people in apartments or possibly hotel rooms, maybe, because they
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.520]   are putting Amazon Echoes in hotel rooms.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.840]   So if you had someone...
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.240]   So you need to be in voice range initially for the initial attack and then Bluetooth
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.320]   arranged the rest of the time.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.320]   But if you have a thin wall and you could shout an experiment with your neighbor, shout
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.520]   "Echo, what's the one they're going to be like?"
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.240]   And if it responds, then you know that he is vulnerable and then if you have an Echo
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.240]   Store, are you?
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:12.880]   Or if you hear endless fart jokes, then you know.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.880]   That's more fun.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.880]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:18.000]   And that the hacker is a teenage boy.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   Yes.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.440]   Or a five-year-old child.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.440]   Or the host.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.440]   Or the host.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.640]   A vidcast called this week in Google.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.640]   Okay.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.640]   All right.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.400]   Now I'll do the...
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:34.320]   I don't even know what the edge it...
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.440]   We went off to while we went off to it.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.600]   It started with Anastasia.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.440]   It started with Stacellicious and then Anastasia.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.440]   You never was off that now.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.440]   And then it went down.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.760]   And then it was the Stasis book club and then I didn't add for the club twit.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.680]   And then anyway, just you know.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   That's me.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680]   What is your middle initial?
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680]   Squirrel.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.680]   What is it?
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.680]   Squirrel?
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.680]   L.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:55.680]   That's squirrel.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:56.680]   L.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.680]   And my middle name is Lin.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.400]   Anastasia L. Higginbotham.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400]   Perfect name.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.080]   I thought W was better.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.280]   I thought W is pretty good.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.280]   Because you want more syllables.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.280]   More syllables.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.280]   More syllables.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.280]   Yes.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.280]   Okay.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.280]   Dear ad.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.800]   Lisa came very close.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.760]   Very close to sending you our wordle square from last night.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.640]   But I said, "No," Jeff would hit their roof.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.640]   No, don't do it to me.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.640]   Lisa.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   What about you and you Lisa?
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.640]   Jesus.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.640]   Who are you?
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:31.600]   We should send this to Jeff.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.000]   All right.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.120]   Jeff Jarvis is here from CUNY and Buzz Machine.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.920]   And have you been on MSNBC lately?
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.840]   No, I don't know what I said.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.600]   It would be on an age.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.600]   Yes, the war, you know.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.800]   Well, I've been on pandemic.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.800]   Used to be on all time.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.600]   You know, like every white male on the internet, I am an epidemiologist.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.600]   So, yeah.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:59.600]   You have opinions.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.880]   Let me explain COVID to your ladies.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.360]   I'm now an expert in flyer results and diplomacy.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:12.360]   Also, Stacy Higginbotham, who is a very legitimate expert in all things.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.960]   Chip, were you impressed?
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.240]   Did you follow at all the Apple announcement yesterday?
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.240]   I was.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.640]   I followed some of it.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.840]   I had to get on a plane.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.640]   I was just blown away.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:26.120]   No, please, can the captain hold off?
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.080]   They haven't announced the phone yet.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.320]   I'm hearing something about an interconnect secret feature.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.960]   I don't know how secret it was, but it's true.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.960]   I had not read about it.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:41.320]   It was in the Apple processors, the Silicon processors that allowed them to do a high-speed
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.040]   interconnect with other chips.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.440]   Now, up to other dies.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.000]   Up to now, there's only been one die in all the Apple Silicon devices.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   But now with these new Apple studio devices, there are two die on the Ultra anyway.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.560]   The interconnect is apparently very, very fast.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.160]   I can't remember the numbers they gave, but it was something several hundred gigabytes.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.160]   No, terabytes.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.240]   It was two and a half terabytes a second of data over these interconnects, which is incredibly
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.240]   fast.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.800]   At this point, it feels like in chip design, Apple's starting to leave everybody in the
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.800]   dust.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.440]   I mean, memory bandwidth was our big issue.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.360]   Apple's just like, they're like, let's buy some chip firms.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.680]   Let's hire some people.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:26.040]   And then two years later, they're like, bam, we've changed that.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.400]   We have changed everything.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.400]   It's really impressive.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.400]   Go Apple.
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.400]   It is.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.840]   I mean, in a way, I'd say go Apple because we can buy Apple products, but I'd love to
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:40.880]   see until AMD and Nvidia and others say, okay, okay, okay, we'll do that too.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.680]   Well, they have been trying to do it.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.120]   I mean, they really have.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.400]   It's not like they weren't solving for this problem.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.560]   It's just that Apple solved better.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.000]   Yeah, it has done a really good job.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.960]   And they also do a really good job marketing.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.040]   I mean, nobody tunes into Nvidia's.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.600]   No, no, I do.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.600]   We did.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600]   We did.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.600]   We do.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.240]   Actually, we covered it last year anyway.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.760]   And I probably covered it again this year.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.480]   It's the next month, I think.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.720]   But you're right.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:12.160]   It doesn't get the attention that Apple doesn't get the love and the cool graphics.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.080]   I mean, Nvidia's last thing was cool.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.080]   You know, why?
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.480]   Because they did it all in VR or AR or magic.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:23.800]   In fact, we found out that even after the fact, even their CEO was a imaginary.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.800]   I love it.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.000]   For a couple of minutes, not for the whole talk.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.200]   No, we followed that.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.200]   I thought that was very interesting.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:35.680]   I'm really excited about Nvidia, what they're doing with AI and cars as well as gaming.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:40.440]   They really have found a way to use these GPUs in very exciting ways.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.600]   Yeah, I wanted to put them on the cover of Fortune in 2015.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.080]   But they said no.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.080]   It's too nerdy.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.080]   You're smart.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.640]   2017, they did it.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.200]   Hey, here's some good news.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.760]   And I wouldn't call this greenwashing at all.
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:56.520]   Tesla's just announced, you know, remember that Elon Musk announced that SpaceX was going
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.360]   to send Starlink terminals to Ukraine.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:05.040]   Now Tesla's announced they're sending powerwalls to Ukraine and expanding the supercharger
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:11.240]   network for Tesla's.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.600]   And I'll give you your tank.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:19.920]   Yeah, and giving up to three months of pay to employees going back to work.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.000]   So I don't know what that has to do with Ukraine.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.960]   Powerwalls, you may mock that, I did.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:32.400]   But in a way, if you're worried about inconsistencies in power generation, having a big old battery
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.560]   in your house is possibly value.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.600]   If you have some way to charge it, yeah.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.000]   Wait, did we do that?
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   No, no.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.400]   I thought I was running off.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.720]   I thought I was old as an adult too.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:50.920]   And it passed by and I didn't notice at least you had the courage to ask.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920]   I'm running.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.920]   Okay.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.920]   Go get a snack.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.920]   Go get a snack.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.520]   And then I'm like, they're like talking about Elon Musk.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.080]   I'm like, okay, just throwing some in.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:04.240]   I like to throw in little tidbits here and there because then people zone down on Twitter
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.920]   so effectively it's all a strategy to keep people from skipping the ads.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:15.040]   If you don't know where the ad began, where the ad ends, you just ruined it, Stacy.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:19.600]   You just keep it going because you might miss something good like that.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:20.600]   You see?
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.400]   And my quest, my quest for snacks and like, wait, don't come back.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:29.440]   So they're all there's a bunch of people who are coming back from their snack break.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.440]   And guess what?
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:31.440]   It's time for the ad.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:35.040]   Our show today brought to you by Code Academy.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.600]   Woo.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.600]   Love Code Academy.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:38.600]   You want to change your career?
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:42.000]   There's never been a better time to be a coder.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.760]   I'm a hobbyist, but I think it's so great.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.720]   It's such a fun thing to do to write code.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.080]   And maybe you've thought I'd like to know more about this.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.400]   I talk to people all the time.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.400]   I'm like, boy, I think I might like coding.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.360]   Well, here's how you find out.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.640]   Learn to code in your own terms with Code Academy.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.440]   You won't be alone over 50 million people already know that Code Academy is the best
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:15.440]   way to learn to code because Code Academy not only teaches you job ready coding skills,
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:21.240]   it also, this is really important, helps you build unique projects for your portfolio.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:26.160]   Earn certificates you could put on your LinkedIn page, even prep for technical interviews,
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:32.720]   everything you need to get a job doing something you love coding.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.360]   Oh, man.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.360]   That's so cool.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:39.160]   One of the things I love about Code Academy, and by the way, I do, I just do their classes
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:45.000]   for fun, but I took some Python classes there, for instance, I keep trying to get better
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.480]   Python is you're coding from the very first day.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.760]   The interface with Code Academy, you start typing some code, you press submit or run,
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:58.760]   I guess, and then it tells you, did you, nope, that's not it.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.200]   Here's what you need to work on.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:04.920]   So you're actually getting instant feedback right from day one, you can learn at your
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.280]   own pace.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.080]   There's no hurry perfect for me because I'm kind of, you know, I'm a casual coder.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.560]   But if you're in a hurry to get a job and qualify for in demand jobs, you can do it
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:19.080]   as fast as you want, as fast as you need, you could choose what to learn from building
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:24.440]   basic websites to artificial intelligence, everything in between.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.160]   And it doesn't matter if you've never done any coding before.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.720]   You'll be writing real working code in minutes.
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:36.400]   And if you're a pro, you could start at a level that's appropriate to you and get even
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.720]   better at it.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.400]   Look at the list of languages.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.400]   Go to, go to code Academy.com, just see.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:47.040]   But of course, Python, and you know, if you want to be a full stack coder, you'll need
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.680]   HTML, CSS, you probably need SQL, JavaScript, those are the most popular right now, but
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.320]   there, there's a lot of languages there.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.200]   If you're not sure where to begin, well, don't worry.
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.240]   In fact, Lisa and I did this for fun.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:05.520]   There's a programming personality quiz on the site that you could take.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.600]   It's not asking you coding questions or about, you know, math ability.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:12.680]   It's asking what you like, what you're interested in, how you think.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:18.160]   And it will then tell you what track would be the best tailored career advice and which
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:22.040]   courses you should take based on your interests and your strengths.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.440]   And it was exactly right on.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.600]   I have to tell you for both me and Lisa.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.160]   You said, oh, you need to do a computer science track.
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.480]   Lisa, you need to do statistics.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.440]   It suggested I do, I think, learn Python.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.880]   It's just Lisa to learn R, which is a statistics language.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.880]   It was really right on.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.880]   It was very interesting.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.560]   Get instant feedback.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.440]   Your code will be tested as soon as you submit it.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:46.040]   You always know if you're on the right track, but don't worry.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.080]   There's lots of help there as well.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.880]   You're not on your own by any means.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:55.120]   It's a completely interactive platform, but you learn by doing.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.600]   And build that portfolio.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.600]   Very important.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.240]   Get that certificate of completion.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:02.400]   You will be much more marketable to future employers.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.000]   And then you can land your dream job in web development or programming or computer science
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.800]   or data science and tons more.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:14.480]   If you want to learn a new skill to build websites, to troubleshoot tech issues, to transition
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:21.320]   into a new career, this is where you go code, academy.com.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:26.480]   One over 50 million people learning to code with code academy to see where coding can
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.480]   take you.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:30.720]   Get 15% off your code academy pro membership.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:37.280]   When you go to code academy.com, use a promo code twig that's TWIG is the promo code.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:44.480]   C-O-D-E-C-A-D-E-M-Y code cat demi.com.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.160]   15% off code academy pro is a great deal.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:58.080]   The best way to learn to code code academy.com, the promo code twi and G.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:05.400]   Okay, we're back with Jeffrey Jarvis and Estasia Higginbotham.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:10.160]   All fully, you're fully fed.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.600]   You're not going to pass out.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.160]   Sort of fed, but yes.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.160]   I was shoving.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.840]   Did you see me shoving my crackers in my mouth?
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.840]   No, no, no.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.440]   I give you a complete privacy.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.440]   Privacy.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.360]   While you're eating like a pig.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.200]   John sees it all, but not I.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.360]   There's no trough, y'all.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.160]   It's just, you know, rapid fire crunching.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.600]   I try to mute too.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:33.760]   You know, if you want, I could take more time on those ads and you give you a little more
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:34.760]   time.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.760]   I don't want you to rush.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.760]   I don't want you to rush.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.560]   No, big and nice grilled cheese sandwich.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.840]   Yeah, I'm like, really, how much time do we have?
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.680]   Because, you know, most food requires a little bit more time.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.680]   Yeah, crackers.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.680]   That's the point.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.200]   I was hoping waffles at least.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.360]   The waffles take six minutes to toast.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.840]   You should have a toaster in your office.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:53.840]   You caught you with epiphy.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:54.840]   He only takes seven minutes.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.840]   So, hey.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.600]   Well, I could be eating, but then, you know, the pasta would be super messy.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.280]   Not to mention it's slurping.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.840]   It's just ASMR right there.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.280]   Hey, you know, remember when-
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.600]   You both gave him money for that.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:19.400]   It's a new show on the Twit Network.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.800]   Amazon, remember when-
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.800]   Slurping.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.800]   Slurping.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.800]   Slurping.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.800]   Slurping.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.400]   And Estasia Slurping Higginbotham.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:35.600]   A group of- Remember the testimony?
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:43.960]   All the CEOs came to talk to the House Committee about data and all that stuff, the Judiciary
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.600]   Committee, Jerry Nadler.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.600]   Yes, stupid questions.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.600]   David Sisolini.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.400]   Yeah, you remember that?
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:58.240]   Well, a letter comes from the Committee to the Department of Justice today, urging it.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:06.240]   We urge you to open an investigation into Amazon and its executives for criminal obstruction
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.240]   of Congress.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:11.480]   What could this be?
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:17.000]   The group contends Amazon is engaged in a pattern and practice of misleading conduct,
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.880]   lying to Congress, in response to our questions about its private label practices and its
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.400]   collection of third-party seller data.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:29.440]   Why don't you bring in Walmart and great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and those
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.440]   developers?
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.440]   Dude, no.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:36.520]   No, Amazon has not only enshrined this process, but it's part of their business strategies
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.960]   to harvest this data and take advantage of it.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:45.120]   So yes, it was for every retailer before.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.120]   From Macy's to Walmart.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.120]   Not to the extent that Emmon.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:54.320]   I know they got more data, but Macy's has dated two online now and Walmart.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:58.840]   So it's a practice of retailing since time immemorial.
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:04.040]   You would have all those generic brands on the grocery shelf if they didn't know that
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.320]   you wanted to buy those products.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:09.000]   All right.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.560]   Lawmakers have zeroed in claiming Amazon made false and misleading statements to the House
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:16.960]   Committee about its practices.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.120]   I remember Jeff Bezos saying things like, "Well, that would be illegal if they did that.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.120]   I don't think they did that.
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.120]   Let me check."
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:29.120]   Apparently, after the fact, they refused to turn over evidence that would either corroborate
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.480]   its claims or correct the record.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.520]   So if you're going to assert, "No, no, no, no.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:37.280]   We tell them you can't do that and they didn't do that.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:41.560]   And if they did, they did it against orders, but you need to prove that."
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:47.960]   According to the letter, "It appears Amazon appears to have done so to conceal the truth
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:53.480]   about its use of third-party sellers' data to advantage its private label business and
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:58.160]   its preferencing of private label products and search results which were the subject
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:02.920]   of the committee's investigation."
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:11.120]   And by Jerry Nadler, David Sisolini, Ken Buck, Matt Gaetz, and Pramila Jayapal.
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.320]   There's interesting bedfellas.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:18.120]   If you're agreeing with Matt Gaetz, what does that tell you?
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:20.680]   It's thick for a second.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.680]   What does that say?
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.360]   So they sent it to the DOJ now.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:28.040]   It's up to Merrick Garland in the department to decide whether to prosecute or not and
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.600]   who to prosecute and all that stuff.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:35.040]   There is no guarantee of prosecution we should point out.
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.040]   But...
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.000]   They're just saying, "We're Congress.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000]   You lied to us."
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000]   You lied to us.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.920]   I don't think it's all that clear that they were lied to.
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:50.240]   I think this is basically their effort to say, "Look, we asked this.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.240]   We're serious.
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.240]   We want to know.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.560]   And you can't just up-suke."
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:55.720]   I cannot say that word.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:56.720]   "Up-spook-cake."
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:57.720]   Obviously.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.720]   "Up-spook-cake."
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:01.480]   "Up-spook-cake-of-bose-cake."
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:02.680]   Anymore.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:08.080]   Lawmakers pointed to, quote, "credible investigative reporting."
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:13.600]   Thanks, journalists from Reuters, the Markup and the Wall Street Journal that directly contradicts
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:17.520]   testimony from Bezos and the Wall Street Journal.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:24.240]   Yeah, regardless of that, there is that fundamental question.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.000]   What did Amazon do that so very different from what grocery stores have been doing for
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.600]   the last century?
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.320]   Grocery stores knows exactly how much tuna fish you buy.
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:36.880]   If they think it's worth it for them to have a can of generic tuna fish, just put on the
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.520]   shelf next to the chicken of the sea, they're going to do that.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.280]   You could argue that because Amazon, I mean, you could also argue that some grocery stores
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:50.680]   now have this, but Amazon sells what 50% of e-commerce here in the US, which then means
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:55.680]   that you don't have other alternatives to bring your goods to market.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:00.880]   Here's the better argument for you, Stacey, I think, on your side of this question.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:06.320]   Is playing devil's advocate, trying to be Leo for a minute?
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:20.560]   If I search for Pellegrino and you do a really good job of serving me and my bubbles, then
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:25.520]   it's at that point that it could be an unfair use of the data, but you as an individual.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:30.400]   Then Brad Stone's book, Amazon Unbound, which is very good, by the way, the successor to
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.680]   the Everything Store, the first book he wrote about Amazon, he talks about the specific
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:43.280]   issue and about at least for some of the time, Amazon's very clear instruction.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:50.840]   They said, interestingly, we'll get in trouble if you share data between the private, you
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:55.200]   know, our stores and church estate.
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.000]   They knew that that was a potential problem, that there were some executives who wanted
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.440]   to do it, who thought it'd be just fine, but they had decided in this book, and I wish
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:08.120]   I had the book with me, I'd look up the passage, but they decided in the, according to Brad
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.200]   Stone, no, yeah, we better not do that.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:16.640]   But there were executives who were cowboys who said, no, no, no, this is too valuable.
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.680]   We got to do this.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.040]   So there was a debate over it anyway.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.040]   Interesting.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.800]   The thing that they saw that is potentially problematic.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:28.080]   They did not choose the Jeff Jarvis defense.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.520]   They could have thrown those guys under the bus with Congress and then Congress wouldn't
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:35.360]   have an excuse for calling for the Justice Department to intervene.
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.360]   But Amazon is like, eh, no.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.360]   I think Jeff tried to.
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:42.440]   I mean, essentially he said, well, if we did, that would be wrong.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.440]   We don't do that.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.960]   But then you do actually, in that case, you do have to follow up.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.120]   I mean, you have to find somebody else.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.000]   We could do that, but that would be wrong.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000]   That would be wrong.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.840]   That would be wrong.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:03.520]   I'm not, I guess, is it more harmful to consumers that Amazon does it than the A&P did it?
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:07.120]   Yes, because Amazon is, oh, go ahead.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:10.120]   One of the issues I think for Congress is that Amazon first that--
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.120]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:15.000]   --Amazon recommends what, you know, when you search for a product--
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   That's the key.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.240]   --it says Amazon Essentials and then it also says Amazon's best suggestion.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:26.040]   And it's never been clear how you qualify for that.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.040]   So there's that.
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.520]   So yes, the Amazon recommends is a huge problem.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.080]   The other problem is that a lot of companies can't go to market without Amazon.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:38.680]   And Amazon actually has programs to pull these kinds of products in.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:44.560]   And then it scours their data and then is like, oh, this is interesting.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:45.600]   Let's make one.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:53.600]   So there's many levels of what I think most normal people would recognize as unethical.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.600]   Potential problems, yeah.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.720]   Well, it's not unethical or, you know, look at what is Congress looking for harms to consumers,
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:01.720]   right?
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.720]   Well, no.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:10.320]   So Lena Kahn, as we've talked about, is really shifting the conversation from harms to consumers,
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.000]   which no one can argue Amazon does because consumers can buy so much more stuff, much
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000]   more cheap.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:25.640]   --to harms to society, harms to labor, harms to competitors in the market, harms to startup
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:26.880]   and innovation.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.960]   If you, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago with the FTC putting out their request
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.160]   for, it's not a request for proposal.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.640]   What is it?
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.680]   They did a memorandum that was basically like, should we look into all of this?
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:47.160]   And that's the crux of this because Amazon built their entire parcel of unethical behaviors
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:51.160]   around, yeah, we're fine because we're making cheaper things for consumers.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.200]   I mean, from the consumer's point of view, this is, I just did a search for dish soap.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.960]   One of the things I always liked about Amazon, it will show me a variety of products and
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:04.800]   something that you could find in the stores, but it's hard, the cost per ounce, right?
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.200]   Oh, well, let's talk about pricing because Amazon doesn't show me and you the same pricing
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:14.640]   and that pricing changes several times a day.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:21.520]   And that's another issue where as companies like Amazon and Wal-Mart's doing this too,
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:26.960]   I mean, it's not that particular issue is not only Amazon's issue, we're seeing a lot
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.600]   less transparency around pricing that is really going to hurt consumers in the long run.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.200]   Well, that'll bite them if it turns out that there's a bias in that pricing.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:44.720]   Well, it may not because they've gotten so big, there's not like a lot of opportunities
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.120]   for me to find alternatives.
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:52.040]   And that's what's really interesting because they've squeezed out a lot of those alternatives
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:53.360]   at the moment.
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.680]   And if I were an alternative and I had something cheaper than Amazon and a way to do it, I'd
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:01.080]   probably have to go through Amazon to sell it to the wider market.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:07.040]   Well, but I'm also saying Stacy that if once you decide to do variable pricing, if you're
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:17.440]   not careful, if you end up charging poor black people more than poor Latino people, more than
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:24.440]   more people, more than whatever, then you better be careful about how the algorithm.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.440]   So Stacy, you said that-
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.440]   They don't care about that.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.000]   You said that at any given time, different people see different prices.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.840]   Is that the case or just that the pricing varies?
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.040]   But we all see the same thing at any given time.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.040]   I think it's more that-
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.040]   No, it's the price can vary both.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.640]   It can vary across geographic reasons or regions.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:41.880]   Well, that might make sense.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.920]   That would make sense.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:48.160]   But if it's offering Stacy a deal that is not offering me-
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.160]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.160]   That would be-
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.160]   That's your old fart.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.160]   Yeah, that'd be really wrong.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.640]   So that happens though.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:55.640]   Okay.
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:56.640]   That does happen.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:03.360]   Sometimes did a story actually documenting this not too long ago, like a week ago.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.720]   Differential pricing is probably what you should Google.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.720]   Let's see.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:11.520]   Here's a hand soap because I know that Amazon sells its own brand of liquid hand soap.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:19.240]   The Amazon choice is actually from a competitor's soft soap right next to theirs, Solomo, which
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.240]   is half the price.
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:26.440]   So you might say, "Well, that may be Amazon's choice, but I'm going to buy Amazon's brand."
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.680]   They also have a best seller indicator.
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:29.680]   Okay, so let me-
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.680]   Let me do this.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.480]   Let me go to liquid hands.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.800]   All right, so I just did.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.480]   I get different results.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:41.600]   So my first result was soft soap moisturizing hand liquid, $7.74 for a six-
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.640]   Mine is Dove nourishing foaming hand wash for 14 years.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.640]   What the hell?
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.640]   I don't see Dove on here at all.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.640]   Wait, is yours?
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.640]   I'm not supposed to answer it.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.640]   Okay, now I go down.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.440]   Show me your screen again, Leo.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:52.440]   Liquid hand soap.
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440]   Here we go.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.440]   No sponsor results.
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:55.440]   Okay, so you're right under the results.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:56.440]   Yep.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.760]   So my first result is sponsor.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.800]   It's evolved by nature, liquid hand soap refill.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:04.440]   That is the second one.
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.440]   How much?
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.440]   $23.99.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.440]   It's okay.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.800]   I got that too.
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.360]   That's sponsored.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360]   And my ama-
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:15.880]   Then I mean, next one is featured from our brands, which is not sponsored, but also feels
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.720]   a little weird.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.720]   Who's is that?
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.440]   And that is- That's Amazon brand.
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:22.440]   So-
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.440]   Solomo.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.440]   How much is your solomo?
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.440]   $6.58.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.440]   Four.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.440]   I get-
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.440]   A 32-
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.040]   A two pack of 32 fluid ounce.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.960]   I see a two pack of 56 ounce.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:34.640]   They must think I hands- My hands are dirtier than yours.
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:37.440]   So I've been getting charged 10 cents of fluid ounce.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:38.440]   Yes, as-
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.920]   Leo, I get the same soft soap.
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:41.800]   You have under Amazon's choice.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:42.800]   Yes.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.440]   That I get highly rated-
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.440]   For $14.88?
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:46.440]   Yes.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.440]   $14.88.
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:50.200]   Yeah, so I don't expect the same.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.120]   I mean, this obviously is so anecdotal.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.120]   It's not useful.
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.640]   Well, it's also interesting.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.720]   How do you say what's the prime position here, except for what's on top-
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:05.800]   What's on top-top is aromatic aromatherapeutic hand care products.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:06.800]   I mean, they don't know-
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:07.800]   Yeah, it's a whole brand.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:08.800]   I hate aromatherape.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:09.800]   I hate it.
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.160]   Well, and that's an advertisement, and I don't-
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.680]   For some reason, not getting it.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:14.680]   Maybe because I have an ad blocker.
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:15.680]   Right.
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:16.680]   I don't know.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.680]   But then you have-
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:17.680]   So-
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.680]   Then sponsored results.
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.360]   As it results in on the far right is a sponsor.
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.080]   That's the Dove and the Evolved.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.480]   And Amazon's choice, and then highly rated, and then more results.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.480]   I don't even have highly rated.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.080]   So what's the prime position in all that?
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.080]   The top line is obviously the prime position, right?
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.080]   Well, I don't-
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:34.080]   I mean, so highly rated.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.080]   Well, that's all sold.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.080]   That's sponsored.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.080]   That's why Amazon-
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.080]   No, this is not sold.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.560]   This is not advertising business than newspapers.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.560]   So am I-
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.120]   How do I know if it's sold?
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.720]   Wouldn't it- Is there no indicator that it's sold?
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:48.720]   Oh, you're interested in it.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.720]   So, yeah, mine, I get-
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:50.720]   You don't know mine, it is.
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.320]   No, that must be my ad block.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.320]   For right.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.320]   Yeah, that's my ad block, I guess.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:57.320]   Yeah, that must be your-
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.320]   Oh.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.320]   'Cause my results-
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:00.320]   Sort by featured.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.960]   I can also sort by price.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.760]   Maybe I wouldn't have the same issues if I search by price.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.280]   Hide a low, low to high average customer view.
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.120]   Actually, that's often how I will search for this kind of thing.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.000]   Yeah, I get the soft, so 1080-
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]   What was your lowest?
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000]   Low price?
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000]   So, Aloe Vera 904.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]   7.5 ounces?
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000]   Okay, price difference, mine is 1083.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000]   What?
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000]   Mine has a line through 1083.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000]   Ha ha ha.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.200]   It shows me 904.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.000]   For some reason, I do see the 1083.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.920]   But it's crossed out.
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.240]   Maybe because I'm a special person.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.600]   Mine says only one left in stock.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:46.960]   Let's fight for it, Leo.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:49.960]   Mine says I could buy two and save 2%.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:52.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.680]   That's the one I know is a lie.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.200]   Only one left in stock when you see stuff like that.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.960]   That's that I know is made up.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.680]   Let me see if I see it.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:03.640]   No, that doesn't say anything about that.
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.640]   But wait a minute.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.640]   Is this?
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:08.160]   No, see this ships from Herb.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:09.160]   Herb's pro.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.480]   See, that's the other thing is this is a third party.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.640]   This is not an Amazon.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:15.320]   You can't tell that from the front page.
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:18.880]   Well, because you can grab like a crime recognizes it out.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:23.320]   Well, but if it's sold by Amazon, is it always prime?
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:24.680]   No, not everything is prime.
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.800]   They've got some of the stuff.
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.800]   And could you buy?
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.960]   No, see, this is ships from Amazon
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.640]   but sold by health and wellness and it is prime.
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:33.640]   So you can't--
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:35.560]   And that's actually bought from someplace else.
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.320]   That's not even--
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:37.840]   Right.
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.200]   So this is one of the--
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:42.800]   I don't shop for things as much on Amazon.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.360]   I shop very little for Amazon anymore
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:50.880]   because it's going into the dollar store or TJ Maxx.
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:51.960]   It really is.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.720]   It's cluttered.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:54.920]   It's confusing.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.280]   I'm not feeling like I'm getting--
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.720]   not even the best deal, just a fair deal on stuff.
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:00.720]   It's so hard to hear.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:02.320]   I think this is the legal mistake in Seattle.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.640]   The Amazon police are going to come and get you a station.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.320]   If you go to the Amazon front page
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.720]   though, you might be hard pressed to figure out
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.680]   what exactly their business is.
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:12.480]   I'm being offered their gaming service, Luna,
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.760]   the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and some various sundries,
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:21.080]   including some headphones, some books from Kindle.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.720]   It's-- Keep shopping for hand soap.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.000]   I'm going to get so much hand soap.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.840]   Oh, no, no, stop.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.760]   Next to you.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.080]   Well, here's a toilet seat.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:28.560]   I don't know.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.200]   I don't know why.
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.200]   I don't know why that--
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:36.360]   And a stethoscope.
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.400]   Oh, they know I want an office chair or a desk.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.200]   And then this is the new thing, by the way.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.080]   These shop live streams, have you ever watched these?
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:45.560]   No.
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:45.920]   No.
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:49.400]   My friend used to do them for--
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.200]   she would do them for Chinese goods.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.160]   These are great.
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.320]   Oh, he's signing.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:53.840]   How cool is that?
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:56.760]   Yeah, look at that set, though.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:57.120]   Wow.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:00.960]   And he's got your little LED lights on the background.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:04.280]   Those are not brand name LED lights in the background
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:04.800]   right there.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.760]   I'm just going to tell you that right now.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.480]   Those are knock off LED lights.
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:12.320]   You take a lot of people watch these.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.120]   Sounds like you do.
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:13.720]   It's a big trend.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:14.960]   It's a huge shopping trend.
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:15.360]   So we're doing it.
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:15.880]   We're doing it.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:16.720]   Amazon's doing it.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:18.160]   Well, how many shopping channels
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:21.360]   we have on TV after all these years of Capital Monty.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.080]   There's like five channels on my cable.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.800]   Well, if I were going to do an Amazon live,
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:32.320]   shoppable live stream, what should I sell?
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.920]   Because it's got to be something--
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:35.280]   the people who would watch me--
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.240]   Thermomics.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:38.080]   Thermomics, yeah.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.120]   Substack has an RSS reader.
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:45.980]   You missed Google Reader.
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:49.400]   Today, Substack-- here's Hamish Mackenzie--
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:53.480]   saying we're launching an app for Substack using it
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.640]   makes me feel like a reader again.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:58.640]   It's where I read my favorite writers at their best.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.560]   I love it.
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.840]   Good news, bad news.
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:09.000]   It's only an app, not web, and only Apple, not Android.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.800]   Who gets-- maybe you have the bigger questions.
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.400]   Who gets on that app?
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.720]   Their stuff is there, so you can read it.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:17.640]   But they say you can add any RSS feed.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:22.000]   Oh, by going to reader.substack.com.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.480]   But you have to use the app.
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.600]   But you have to use the app that you can add it online.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.200]   OK.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:29.800]   OK, so it is open, in that sense.
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:30.640]   Although they figure--
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:33.440]   And harvesting as much data as they can through an app
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.200]   instead of on the web.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.480]   I asked Dave Weiner what he thought about it.
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.240]   And he said, it's an app.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.280]   I don't really use that.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.640]   Everybody was asking Dave, why is everybody asking me this?
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:44.080]   Because you're RSS, Dave.
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:45.240]   You're the man.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:47.480]   We depend upon you.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.360]   So we had some thoughts.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.960]   I'm trying to find what it was then.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:55.600]   Silence no more.
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:58.320]   The second Washington state, your state,
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.880]   is now the second state in the union
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:03.000]   to pass the Silence No More Act.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:03.800]   Just take a guess.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:05.400]   What does that do?
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.440]   Silence no more.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:09.040]   I cheated.
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:10.000]   I don't know.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.720]   Thank you for being honest, Jeff.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.840]   It bans employers in the state--
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:16.600]   it's California is the other state--
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:19.880]   from using NDAs to prevent workers
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:22.800]   from talking about instances of illegal harassment
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.840]   and discrimination, retaliation, sexual assault,
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.720]   and wage violations, which seems to me
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:29.920]   should be a federal law.
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:30.560]   Yes, it should be.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:33.160]   Yes.
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:36.200]   So this is in response to Sheriff Scarlett,
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:39.600]   who was the Apple employee who kind of was a whistleblower
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.040]   on Apple, saying they basically silence you
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:47.280]   if you want to talk about any of this stuff.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.240]   So it is no longer legal to force employees
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:54.480]   to sign a nondiscript.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.880]   I should say what an NDA is, it's a nondisclosure act.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:47:59.520]   Oh, there's also--
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.920]   there often is also a nondisperagement.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:03.600]   Oh, yeah, not a nondisperagement.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:07.880]   Well, when it's not unusual, when people quit,
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:12.080]   we will say, OK, our fire will give you termination,
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.960]   will give you severance if you sign an agreement not to--
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:20.240]   I wouldn't sign the management editor's contract of Time Inc.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:21.560]   And as a result--
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.840]   You didn't get your severance.
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:28.800]   Three years salary bonus of benefits I gave up.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.800]   And as a result, have you been disparaging them
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.000]   freely ever since?
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.880]   No, but I am finally writing the story of UW.
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:39.720]   Ah, now there's an interest now that it's gone.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:42.840]   Yeah, I know.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:46.640]   Yesterday was International Women's Day.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:50.160]   Nice that you have a day of your own, Stacey.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:53.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.960]   Actually, Apple took it to heart.
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:55.880]   I don't know if you noticed.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.760]   Well, you didn't, because you were at the airport.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.640]   A lot of women presenters, in fact, when they talked about
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:05.920]   the creators using the new hardware, they were all women.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:08.960]   And I think that's very conscious on Apple's part.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:10.760]   They're very aware of this.
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:14.040]   This is the gender pay gap bot.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.360]   Or maybe I should say the gender pay gap bot on Twitter.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.400]   Pay gap app at pay gap.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.800]   These are hyphens in there, yes.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:23.960]   Yes.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.640]   But it's my fault, my fault, gender pay gap bot.
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.480]   So what they do is, I don't know where they got the data
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:34.440]   from exactly, but for every company that put up a, hey,
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:37.680]   yay, International Women's Day.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.720]   But what's up, the differential for women.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.440]   That's awesome.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:46.560]   Then you see the companies deleting the original tweet
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:49.200]   down one after another after another after another.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.480]   Oh, brilliant.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:53.680]   So here's a group housing 21.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:56.680]   As part of our International Women's Day program of events,
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:59.400]   blah, blah, blah, in this organization,
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.760]   according to gender pay gap bot, the women's median hourly pay
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.480]   is 31% lower than men's.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.040]   Raw, raw, cis, boom, blah.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.120]   I think it's British data.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:09.360]   Clearly it's British.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:10.840]   Yeah, clearly it's British.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:12.720]   Tata Steel.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.640]   On occasion of International Women's Day 2022,
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:19.280]   we celebrate, we extend our best wishes
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:21.880]   in this organization, Women's Median Hourly Pay.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:23.640]   It's not too bad, only 4.6%.
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:24.920]   That's fine.
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:25.760]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:26.760]   I'll take that.
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:28.480]   Yeah, there's some that's actually better than others.
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:31.800]   Leeds City College is only 3.1%.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:32.840]   So yeah, there is.
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.160]   I think the company is clear to themselves out,
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:34.880]   but it's brilliant.
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:45.600]   In the intellectual property office, UK, 30%, disparity, 30%.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.880]   Good for you, gender pay gap bot.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:48.960]   Job well done.
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:55.760]   And happy International Women's Day.
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:58.520]   Information can be a weapon.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.600]   Very powerful, very powerful.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:04.360]   And for some reason, still, to this day,
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.760]   putting it on Twitter seems to have some real effect.
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:10.120]   I never will understand why, but if you want to complain--
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:12.040]   It's implementing norms.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.560]   I mean, we talked about that earlier in the show.
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:16.040]   I think Twitter is a great place to police social norms.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.640]   Sure.
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:22.200]   Yeah, nobody wants to be disparaged on Twitter.
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:24.160]   That's where you should do your disparagement,
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:28.320]   now that you sacrificed years worth of vacation pay.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:30.320]   You should really get some for that, do you think?
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:30.840]   Oh.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:31.920]   Vacation pay hell.
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:34.720]   It was full three years salary.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.040]   How could you give that up?
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.280]   Because I was a young schmuck.
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:39.280]   That's a lot of money.
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:39.920]   It's not a money.
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:41.320]   You said, I want the rest of this--
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:41.320]   I want the rest of this--
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.320]   --perage you guys.
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.200]   Who's a penny?
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:45.680]   Wow.
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:48.080]   You know, you're going for journals to sign up.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.600]   Do you regret that now?
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:52.240]   At this age, yeah.
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:53.680]   At the time, I'm just going to problem it.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:55.960]   Sorry, you would have spent it on cigars and hot women.
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.760]   It would have been wasted.
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:58.920]   I was buried.
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.920]   No.
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:03.640]   I'm sorry that I said that's easy.
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.000]   You would have spent it on a house.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000]   That's right for your children to live in.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.800]   Reid Hoffman has co-founded his first new company
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:14.240]   since his sale of LinkedIn.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:16.440]   He made-- well, I don't know how much he made.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:21.600]   He sold LinkedIn to Microsoft for $26 billion six years ago.
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:25.440]   After a few years spending a billion here, a billion there,
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:27.480]   maybe you want to do something else.
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:31.600]   He's going to start a new company called Inflection
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:34.440]   that will aim to develop AI software products to make it
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:38.680]   easier for humans to communicate with computers.
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:41.000]   But what's in my opinion most interesting
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.240]   is his partner, DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman,
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:49.640]   and former DeepMind researcher, Karen Somoneon.
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:54.440]   So some pretty heavy hitters working on this.
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:53:00.120]   How would you do to make computers easier for humans?
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:01.200]   This is a really good question.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.200]   Take instructions.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.920]   Take instructions.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:07.000]   Well, so yeah, taking instructions in natural language
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:07.480]   is one.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:12.240]   But think about what people don't realize is programs often
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:13.600]   have--
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.920]   the logic has to be fully thought out.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.120]   So if I'm communicating with a computer,
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:23.080]   I do have to still think out my logic for the steps.
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:25.640]   If I want something different to happen,
[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:27.440]   I have to figure out the information I
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.360]   need to put in to get the result I want.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:31.520]   And that's really where the challenge is.
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:34.400]   I mean, yes, coding is hard just for me.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.320]   Oh, it's another language.
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.600]   But it's also hard because you have to think through what
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.800]   you're actually trying to do.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.040]   Yeah, you have to be very precise.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:43.080]   In fact, that's exactly what Suleyman said
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:46.360]   in conversation with CNBC on Monday.
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.000]   If you think about the history of computing,
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000]   we've always been trying to reduce the complexity of our ideas
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.480]   in order to communicate them to a machine.
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.680]   Even when we write a search query, we're simplifying,
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:58.640]   we're reducing, we're writing in shorthand
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.680]   so that the search engine can understand what we want.
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:06.440]   You know, I was thinking about Wolfram Alpha,
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:10.720]   which often does a very good job of kind of intuiting
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:12.160]   what you're trying to get at.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:15.320]   In fact, it'll even tell you it's logic, which is great.
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:19.400]   But I guess there's even more we could do.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:21.680]   I was trying, you know why I was trying the other day
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:26.680]   to match gas prices, not Bitcoin gas prices,
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:28.480]   gasoline prices.
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:29.680]   (laughing)
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:31.920]   - Petrol. - Petrol, thank you.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:36.240]   Now we know why we call it Petrol to presidents
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:38.800]   because somebody said, "Well, see what happened?"
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:40.720]   You elect Joe Biden and the gas goes through the roof
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:43.680]   and I thought, "Well, if I could only have a graph
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:48.440]   "correlating gas price to a president--
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.880]   "An adjusted for inflation."
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.000]   - Adjusted for inflation.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.560]   Well, let me see if I can, president, it didn't do work.
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:55.600]   (laughing)
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:00.440]   President adjusted for inflation.
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:02.800]   I think it would do that naturally.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:03.800]   All right, let's see.
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:22.000]   And then Wolfra
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.640]   and then Wolfra says, "Well, first of all,
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:29.840]   "when you say gas price, I'm assuming you mean gasoline?"
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.440]   - Right. - Because of the Arab oil embargo.
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.280]   - Right. - Which was my first big story
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.320]   as a cub reporter.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.960]   - Yeah, Jimmy Carter, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines,
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:42.720]   but unfortunately the presidents have just ignored.
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:45.680]   - You extend the timing before the 90s?
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:47.240]   - Yeah, that seems annoying.
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:51.720]   - Does it tell you the source of the data?
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:52.560]   - Yeah, it does.
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:55.680]   It has all sorts of, I love,
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:58.400]   if you've not played with Wolfram Alpha, it's fantastic.
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.240]   Wolfram is a big part of the von Neumann book.
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:05.440]   - Yeah, because, yeah, I'm not surprised.
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:06.920]   Yeah. - Super genius.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.520]   Man is an editor, but super genius.
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:09.680]   - Yeah.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:11.320]   Well, that's because I found out,
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.680]   do you know how he writes?
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:14.000]   (laughing)
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.520]   - You just dictates?
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:16.360]   - No.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:17.200]   (laughing)
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.000]   Wait a minute, let me see if I can find this.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.840]   He posted a blog post on his workflow.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:26.480]   - Oh God.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.600]   - Seeking-- - He used to have to edit him.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:29.440]   - Did you?
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:30.280]   Oh, good, well, you'll enjoy this.
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:31.120]   - Yes.
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:33.920]   - This is from his blog, StephenWolfram.com.
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.080]   Seeking the productive life,
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.520]   some details of my personal infrastructure.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:39.560]   There he is.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:42.960]   Apparently he spends a lot of time on Zoom,
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:47.400]   but, and he's got a standing desk, okay, off.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:51.040]   Oh, look, he's on a treadmill while he's working.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:54.720]   Okay, now this is why I think he might be pro licks.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:59.000]   He's apparently, he writes while he's walking as well.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000]   He's got a little, he's got a little, he's got a little,
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.400]   look at this.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:05.960]   - Oh my gosh, it's like a little cigarette girl.
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:08.760]   - He's got a stanvers laptop.
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:11.760]   No, he's also got a microphone on, so he's apparently,
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:16.440]   he's also dictating or talking on the phone.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:18.360]   He calls it his popcorn rig.
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:22.240]   And so he gets his walks in,
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:24.160]   but you know, if you've got a long walk,
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.760]   you might as well keep writing.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:28.160]   - Yeah, that fits.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:31.320]   - I really, I just, I don't know why,
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:33.160]   but that stuck in my mind this, I've always,
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:35.160]   I'll never forget this picture.
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:39.600]   Wolfram, Stephen Wolfram in the woods.
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:41.400]   You see, he's a physicist, right?
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:45.080]   And a nerd, obviously.
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:46.600]   - I thought he was a mathematician,
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:48.800]   but he might be both for all I know.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:50.400]   - He does it all.
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.240]   He does it all.
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.320]   - If you read this, it is fascinatingly nerdy.
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.240]   He said, "I used to fill up a bankers box
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:59.160]   "with filed papers every couple of months.
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:01.440]   "Now it takes a couple of years.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.000]   "I have a printer and a write desk."
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.040]   So he's got these little slots.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.400]   He has an array of drawers with a little hack.
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:08.840]   There's a slot at the top that allows me
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:12.280]   to immediately slide things into the drawer without opening it.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:16.240]   - 'Cause that would waste at least five minutes of waste.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.040]   - You need this, Jeff.
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:19.120]   I think you need this.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:19.960]   - Yes.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.560]   (laughs)
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:28.240]   Anyway, just, yeah, but brilliant, brilliant.
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:30.760]   Very interesting fellow.
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:32.200]   Did he also write a book?
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:36.280]   - He still, he apparently wrote a nifty IoT Datastore
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:37.640]   for his nifty software set.
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:38.560]   - Of course.
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:41.000]   - I'm like, "Look at that, I wrote that forever."
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.320]   - We had him on our frankly.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:44.600]   - All due to Eddings, is he?
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:45.440]   - Yeah.
[01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:46.280]   - Did he write for all of them?
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:47.640]   - I was a guest editor at Giga-Oops.
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:51.000]   So, are you asking like, "Why I was the editor?"
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.160]   Or how is it, "How did I make him short?"
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:55.760]   - Well, I actually wrote another version.
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:57.680]   (laughs)
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:58:59.840]   - For years, well, for a hot second,
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:02.520]   I was the managing editor at Giga-Oops, and I hated it.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:06.440]   And then I had to shed that job piece by piece.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:08.280]   So for like two years, I edited it
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:09.920]   into commissioned our guest columns.
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:12.360]   It was the worst time of my life.
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:15.360]   But he was a friend of the site,
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:16.520]   so he would always sit down.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:19.080]   - And he and Omer are probably best buds.
[01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:21.120]   Here's the glasses he found
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:23.600]   to help keep him from getting car sick.
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:25.760]   - Oh, my lord.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.360]   (laughs)
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:28.200]   I don't know what they do.
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:29.480]   - He's a really good dude.
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:30.880]   - Oh, he's super cool.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:32.400]   He's the coolest guy ever.
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:35.520]   - 'Cause I had to edit him on the phone.
[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:37.800]   You could not just send him edits, or you could,
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:39.760]   but you were gonna end up having to talk to him.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:42.000]   - Oh, wow. - So we would end up,
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.160]   we would end up talking.
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.680]   - Where did he fight back?
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:46.920]   - He did never fight back.
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:50.400]   He like all really smart people who know what they're doing.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:54.920]   He hated any generalizations that I had to make
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:57.080]   to make things readable for me.
[01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:58.280]   - You're dumbing it down.
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:00.200]   You're dumbing it down.
[02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:02.720]   - And we went back, I mean, and he respected that,
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:04.680]   but he also, you know, it hurt, it pained him.
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:06.000]   And I get it.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.560]   I mean, I'm a nerd, it pains me to see things dumb down.
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:09.400]   - Yeah.
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:10.240]   - But,
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:14.200]   (laughs)
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:15.120]   You gotta do it.
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:16.760]   - When you're as brilliant as Stephen Wolf,
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:20.720]   I think you needed to come down for most of us.
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:22.820]   Very interesting fellow anyway.
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:25.720]   How do we get there?
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:29.040]   Gas prices, I'm doing it back, rolling it back.
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:32.040]   - Oh, no code, low code for deep mind and re-off.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:36.440]   - AI, you know, making your queries less sophisticated,
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:38.360]   making the computer smarter about understanding
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:40.680]   what you want, that kind of thing.
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.080]   And Reed Hoffman's gonna be working on it.
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:43.520]   Oh, you know what I didn't say?
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:44.760]   Who is Reed Hoffman?
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:46.840]   He was the founder of LinkedIn.
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.640]   And is widely like revered.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:53.600]   - The guy who created the term blitz scaling.
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:01:00.120]   - Full disclosure is that Reed gave us the funding
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.000]   to start more engagement journalism degree.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:02.800]   - Oh, nice.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:04.200]   Thank you, Reed.
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.040]   - Yeah.
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:05.880]   - Yeah.
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:12.240]   - Big security flaw affecting Linux,
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:16.680]   which includes by the way, Android,
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:19.120]   terrible name, dirty pipe.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:26.480]   It allows an attacker to do privilege escalation
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:28.180]   so they can get root.
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:31.720]   And because it's a Linux flaw,
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:32.920]   and it's in the Linux kernel,
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:36.040]   it affects not only Android, but in Chromebooks,
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:40.120]   but Chromecast, speakers, and of course,
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:42.880]   desktop computers.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.920]   Fortunately, because Android devices use
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:49.280]   actually a fairly old version of the kernel,
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.440]   it's not a problem immediately.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:56.960]   Only devices that started with Android 12 are recent enough
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:58.360]   to have it be an issue.
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.800]   Presumably it is being patched as we speak.
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:06.120]   There are no known exploits in the wild yet of dirty pipe,
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:10.360]   but it is considered by many to be the worst Linux
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:11.600]   exploit yet.
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.200]   (sighs)
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:17.920]   Google is releasing an open source harassment filter
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:19.920]   for journalists.
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:20.880]   - For journalists.
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.720]   - What is a harassment filter?
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:27.000]   - I actually forgot, I put it in there.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.260]   - It's called harassment manager.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.960]   Here it is on GitHub.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:34.640]   Online abuse and harassment silence important voices
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:35.960]   and conversation.
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:38.680]   Harassment manager is a web application
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:41.280]   that aims to empower users to document
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:43.080]   and take action on abuse.
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:47.200]   So it won't actually block abuse.
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:49.440]   You won't, you'll see it, but you can take action.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.880]   You can report them.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:52.120]   It's designed for anyone that,
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:52.960]   but this is actually good.
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:54.240]   I might have to download this.
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:57.240]   Anyone that experiences significant online harassment,
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:00.400]   which can be episodic or an ongoing challenge.
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:04.440]   The tool has been built and tested using
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:06.800]   a community-based research and design process
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:09.080]   with active Twitter users.
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:11.120]   The most harassed group in the world
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:14.480]   experienced significant or frequent harassment.
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:18.000]   Target users include folks who are disproportionately
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.440]   impacted by online harassment,
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:21.320]   women of their marginalized groups,
[02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:24.160]   journalists, activists and politicians.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:26.040]   Oh, this comes out of Jigsaw.
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:26.960]   - Jigsaw, yup.
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:27.800]   - Neat.
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.640]   Okay.
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:31.880]   That should have been in the change log.
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:33.280]   That's a good one.
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:34.720]   - Oh, wait, do we have a change log?
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:35.920]   Is it time for the change log?
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:40.920]   - It's time for the Google change log.
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:45.200]   You got a free one, but we got more.
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:46.560]   We got more.
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:51.560]   12L is now 12.1, and it's rolling out
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:56.280]   to Pixel phones, the 12L tablet hardware coming out
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:57.120]   by the end of the year.
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.760]   That was kind of the focus, I think, of 12L.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:04.760]   It was tablet, but Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, 4A, 5A,
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:07.440]   and 5A will get 12L.
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:10.480]   Weirdly, the Pixel 6 will not get an update
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:13.280]   yet later this month.
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:18.760]   I've been running the beta of 12L on my 6 Pro,
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:20.240]   and it's fine.
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:23.440]   So in fact, well, I've never had any problems
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:26.680]   with my Pixel 6, so I'm a weirdo in that.
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:32.440]   Anyway, 12L, it's here, it's time.
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:35.120]   We call this release 12.1, says Google,
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.920]   'cause that's what makes the most sense.
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:42.080]   12.1 is the version Google uses on the factory image page.
[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:45.000]   In blog posts, they're still calling it 12L.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.760]   If you're open, your phone's about page,
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.120]   though you'll find a third name
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:51.400]   under the Android version, Android 12.
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:54.720]   Not L, not 0.1, just old plain old Android 12.
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:59.160]   So Google hasn't even figured out what the name is.
[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:01.640]   But one of them, one of them--
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:03.160]   - We should have just a running thread.
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:05.160]   Things Google still needs to figure out.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:07.840]   - Oh, no, it would be too long.
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:10.920]   There is a March Pixel feature drop, though,
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:13.760]   which many of us will be getting.
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:16.520]   I checked last night and haven't gotten it yet.
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:22.200]   It was released on Monday, but I guess with all of these,
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:25.800]   as with all of these, it's kind of a staged rollout.
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:27.800]   If you have a Pixel phone,
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:31.400]   you're gonna get some additional updates.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:33.680]   The improvements are designed primarily
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:37.480]   for folding phone's tablets and other large screen devices.
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:41.840]   But Google's adding more functionality to live caption,
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:43.760]   which is, I think, a great feature.
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:45.640]   Now, when you're on a phone call,
[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:48.400]   you can see captions of what the other person says
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:51.400]   and type back a response that will be read out loud
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:54.560]   on the other end, like a TTY for deaf people.
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:56.720]   - Oh, very interesting.
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:59.800]   So if you're on the train or the bus
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:02.080]   and you don't want to have a phone call out loud,
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:03.760]   you can do it completely over text,
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:05.760]   in effect text messaging.
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:07.320]   - Love that idea.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:09.520]   And of course, if you're deaf, also great.
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:12.200]   The new feature drop also adds support
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:14.500]   for night sight in Snapchat.
[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:19.680]   There's a new moon icon in the Snapchat camera.
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:22.160]   This is a Google working hand-in-hand
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.320]   with Snapchat to offer--
[02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:27.620]   - Snapchat hosts on Google Cloud.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:29.720]   - Yeah, they're--
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:31.400]   - Sorry, I like-- - It's weird
[02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:33.240]   that they're doing something for an app.
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:34.920]   They get dedicated, sorry.
[02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:38.520]   - Yeah, no, and it's only for pixel owners.
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:40.720]   - Yeah, that is weird.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.960]   Okay.
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:43.520]   - It's not the first time the Pixel 6
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:47.560]   and 6 Pro shipped with a quick tap to snap feature.
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:49.080]   You may remember.
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.720]   YouTube watch parties and live sharing functionality
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:54.000]   for Duo also in the March feature drop.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000]   Weirdly, the March feature drop first arrived
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.960]   on the Galaxy S22 series.
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:02.760]   (laughing)
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:04.960]   I'm confused.
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:09.280]   Emoji and sticker suggestions while typing in Gboard,
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:11.960]   a new interpreter mode in Google Translate,
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:15.560]   activated with, "Hey, you know who be my Spanish interpreter.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:18.880]   Paint me like your French ladies."
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:21.520]   And for a new battery widget that shows the status
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:23.320]   of connected devices.
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:26.240]   So, there you go.
[02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:29.960]   The March feature drop coming soon to a pixel
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:32.000]   near you and a Samsung S22.
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:37.840]   Actually, they're previewing to June pixel drop already
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:41.520]   and Android 12 QPR3 beta one.
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:48.280]   Google kills another fabulous Google thing you never used.
[02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:51.000]   - Nobody ever used.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.920]   - Book on Google for hotels.
[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:58.200]   - Oh, that was always terrible.
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:00.560]   The reason no one used it is 'cause the prices were high
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:02.280]   and it was always in advance.
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:05.200]   You could never do it like the day of--
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:07.960]   - Is this like they wanted to be Expedia or Hotel--
[02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:11.600]   - Yeah, it was frustrating because you'd be like,
[02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:13.040]   "Oh, is this available?"
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.000]   And they'd be like, "Wow, it's too soon to tell
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.120]   'cause it's tonight."
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:18.680]   And you're like, "But this is not helpful."
[02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:25.200]   - Anyway, May 25th, they're shuttering that feature.
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:27.560]   Google Fiber now has a business plan,
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:31.240]   two gigabits for $250 a month,
[02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:35.280]   one gigabit down now to $100 a month.
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:36.360]   - And Gigabit Envy.
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:38.040]   - Wow, Gigabit Envy.
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:40.080]   - What do you have, Stacey?
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:41.600]   What'd you get, once you got?
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:42.840]   - I only have one.
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:43.680]   - Oh, oh.
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:46.320]   - One's plenty.
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:50.600]   I should point out, John's reminding me he has SonicNet
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:55.600]   and his gigabit fiber gigabit is $40, you said?
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:58.520]   50 bucks when you had the fees and stuff.
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:08:59.560]   That's pretty good.
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:00.400]   Half for Google.
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:01.240]   - That's excellent.
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:02.080]   - It's charging.
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:05.320]   If you are calling, let's see,
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:09.240]   is it calling from or to Ukraine?
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:13.720]   Google Voice and Phi Temporally Wave calling fees to Ukraine.
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:15.640]   Let me see.
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:21.800]   International calling fees from Ukraine
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:25.280]   and from the US to Ukraine are now,
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:29.160]   the fees rates are now zero, nothing, not--
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:31.440]   - You can erase the fees from Ukraine to anywhere.
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.640]   - Yeah, that's great.
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:35.360]   And Google has said,
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:38.880]   we have expanded of eligibility for Project Shield,
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:41.080]   our free protection against DDoS attacks
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:43.480]   so that Ukrainian government websites, embassies worldwide
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:45.760]   and other governments in close proximity to the conflict
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:47.080]   can stay online.
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:48.400]   And then of course, we saw it talked earlier
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:51.200]   about cloud flare and crowd strike and ping services.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:53.960]   - Interesting, when I go to Kiev Independent,
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:55.000]   which I recommended last week,
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.040]   which is excellent, or when I go to RT.com,
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.640]   cloud flare comes up and says,
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:02.000]   I'm checking your browser for a few seconds.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:02.960]   - They've got DDoS protection.
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:04.640]   That's their DDoS protection.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:05.480]   - Yeah.
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:06.800]   - Yeah.
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:08.400]   - Can we check in legit?
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:10.240]   - Legit, are you legit?
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:12.360]   He's too legit to quit.
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:14.440]   Chrome OS 99 just came out.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:17.240]   Faster desk creation, improved palm rejection,
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:18.800]   nearby share.
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.680]   And one more thing on the buy-by list,
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:26.160]   Google's pulling the plug on Assistant Snapshot,
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:27.640]   which was, according to 9-5,
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:31.160]   Google the only trace left of Google now.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:34.800]   So if you wanna see what it did,
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:36.960]   you can ask your assistant for updates
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:38.320]   that you see in your snapshot,
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:40.840]   like calendar events per their minor stock prices.
[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:42.440]   Why would they kill that?
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:43.760]   What do they save?
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:45.600]   - Google now used to be my favorite,
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:46.720]   so I just don't get it.
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:47.560]   - Don't understand.
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:48.560]   - I just give up.
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:50.480]   - I remember when Google now came out,
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:52.000]   I was saying, and it's praising saying,
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000]   this is the future.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:53.840]   - Me too.
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:57.600]   - This is where Google's gonna put everybody in the dust.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:59.000]   - Did we all use it or not?
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.840]   - Yeah.
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:01.680]   - I used it.
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:05.080]   - Would have used it more had they beefed it up even more?
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:07.360]   - Yeah, they had to start tying it into more things.
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:09.960]   Yeah, it was such a disappointment.
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:12.120]   - The idea was you'd get, it was card-based,
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:13.800]   and when you get to the airport,
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.040]   there's your tickets,
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.760]   here's the weather, the city you're going to,
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:19.440]   you know, it would kind of know what you're doing.
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:22.920]   And I guess, you know, privacy advocates,
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:24.720]   and just people scared about privacy,
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:25.640]   just probably killed it,
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:26.720]   then nobody wanted to use it.
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:28.640]   - Oh, that actually makes sense.
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:30.080]   But I opted into everything.
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:30.920]   - I did too.
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:31.760]   - No.
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:33.520]   - For it to be useful, you had to say,
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:34.760]   yeah, you can see everything,
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:37.160]   you can look at my Gmail, whatever you want.
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:40.320]   And that's probably what killed it, I'm gonna guess.
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:41.400]   - Well, they still do things,
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:43.840]   like they still pull stuff from my email
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:46.000]   into my calendar for stuff like that.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.280]   - Oh yeah.
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:49.600]   - They're a new feature, I guess they're not now features now,
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:50.800]   I guess, I don't know.
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:52.640]   - Well, Snapshot was one of them,
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:54.640]   but that's going away.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.280]   - Oh, that's short-hand.
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:58.000]   - Oh, this is sad.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.080]   - That's a sad.
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:03.360]   - I thought I would check on my Samsung Galaxy S22
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:07.600]   and see if I have a feature drop.
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:09.920]   Maybe I get it here before I get it on my Pixel,
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:10.760]   that'd be a struggle.
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:15.280]   Nope, software's up to date, security patch, January.
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:16.840]   That sucks.
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:19.160]   That's why you buy a Pixel, right?
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:20.840]   Right there, right there in a nutshell.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:22.600]   - It'll make me have Pixel in V.
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:23.440]   - How's your flip?
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:24.280]   - My little Samsung Flip.
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:25.120]   - How's your flip?
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:25.960]   - It's great, you like it?
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:27.280]   - It's, I love it.
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:28.400]   Come to me.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:29.520]   Ta-da!
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:31.840]   - Oh, I like that wallpaper.
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:32.680]   - This is just the chair.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:34.400]   - And you don't mind the manly wallet,
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.880]   or you're not using the case.
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:37.720]   - I am using the case.
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:38.560]   - Oh, okay.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.400]   - I always use a case.
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:41.520]   - Yeah, it's good, I think for that phone, especially,
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.320]   you kinda wanna keep it a little.
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:44.160]   Isn't that cute?
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:45.200]   Look how cute it is.
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:46.040]   - It has a little,
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:47.920]   I didn't realize this until it was there,
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:49.040]   and then I was like, hello.
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:49.880]   - Isn't that nice?
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:50.840]   Got a little screen on the back
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:52.800]   so that you can see what your notifications are
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:54.280]   or what the time is.
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:56.280]   And actually, you can mess with that
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:58.600]   and get it to show even more stuff.
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:12:59.760]   - Ooh, show more stuff.
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:00.600]   - Show more stuff.
[02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:02.560]   - I usually want my phone to show me less stuff,
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:05.960]   in general, 'cause I'm easily distracted.
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:06.800]   But yes.
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:08.560]   - Yep, turn off notifications, that's for sure.
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:09.560]   And that,
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:11.040]   (drum roll)
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:13.080]   - Change pause.
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:16.720]   - Elon Musk says, "I was forced."
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:18.240]   Forced, I tell ya.
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:20.640]   Into an agreement with the SEC,
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:22.500]   you should throw it out now.
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:25.800]   Oh gosh.
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.840]   - Can we just all sigh and move on, please?
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:30.880]   - Sigh.
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:32.920]   This is the one where he tweeted,
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.920]   funding secured to make Tesla private at $420,
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:41.120]   a share, wink, wink, nudge,
[02:13:41.120 --> 02:13:43.480]   I'll claim later determined to be untrue,
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:46.520]   but of course it's at the stock price sailing.
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:48.240]   - Here's a question.
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:49.240]   - Yeah.
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:54.240]   - Do tech startup founders need to be jerks?
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:57.800]   - Well--
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:13:59.640]   - There's an argument for that, yes.
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:02.080]   - So there are, there's a couple of shows on TV now
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:02.920]   about this.
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:03.840]   - Right.
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:04.760]   - Did you, so there's--
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:05.600]   - Super pumped.
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:06.440]   - Super pumped.
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:07.280]   - I'm starting to watch that.
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:10.120]   - The Uber story, and he's a complete ass from day one,
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:11.320]   Travis Kalanick.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:15.680]   - Though, though, the taxi people are sometimes worse.
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.000]   - Oh yeah.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.600]   Well, it's, you know, it's true in that sense.
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:20.960]   I mean, the medallion owners and the taxi commission--
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:21.800]   - You've watched "Not For Us."
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:22.640]   - Yeah.
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:23.480]   - Yeah.
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:25.160]   - But I mean, even from when he's pitching,
[02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:27.200]   at the very beginning, he's pitching
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:30.520]   what was called Uber car at the time
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:33.840]   to a venture capitalist, he lies and says he invented it.
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:35.480]   He didn't invent it.
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:37.720]   You know, he kinda took it over.
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:41.440]   So yeah, I mean, I don't know how accurate it is.
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:45.120]   It's honestly, it's a little painful for me to watch
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:46.440]   'cause--
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.040]   - I don't watch any of those shows
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:49.600]   'cause I feel like I've lived through it.
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:50.440]   I don't--
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:52.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.560]   The dropout's quite good because it's,
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:56.840]   that's about Elizabeth Holmes in "The Theranos" story.
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:59.440]   It starts when she's a little girl.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:02.160]   And so it gives you a little bit more, perhaps,
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.320]   depending on how accurate it is,
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:05.280]   a little more perspective into why she did.
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:06.360]   I mean, that's the question.
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:07.280]   Why she did this?
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:09.280]   Did she knowingly defraud people?
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:11.520]   Was she swept up by events?
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:14.160]   What exactly happened?
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:16.680]   And I think they give you a pretty good explanation of that.
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:19.680]   It's from a, I also like it 'cause it's from a podcast.
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:22.280]   And, you know.
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:25.960]   - So you're saying that, so on the whole,
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:27.200]   and I have an exception to the second one,
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:28.880]   on the whole are you saying they do need to be?
[02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:29.920]   - Jerks. - No.
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:31.720]   But look, you look at Steve Jobs,
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:33.400]   you look at Bill Gates, who was a real jerk.
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:35.280]   - Re-jord was a jerk.
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:36.320]   - Who was?
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:37.120]   - And Re-Ford.
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:38.640]   Oh my God, was he a jerk.
[02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:40.680]   But maybe he wasn't a jerk for the times, I don't know.
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:41.880]   - What about Reid Hoffman?
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:42.800]   Was he a jerk?
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:43.640]   - No.
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:44.480]   I know.
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:45.320]   - Oh God.
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:46.160]   - By all accounts.
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:47.720]   - We had Perry Chen, talked to my class the other day,
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:48.880]   and he was not a jerk,
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:50.640]   and he also started what is in fact
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:52.880]   as a small and successful company.
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:53.720]   And that's a bit.
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:55.080]   - That's kind of the question that they ask
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:55.920]   in the dropout.
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.560]   Did she have to lie to get funding?
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:01.480]   Is it fake it till you make it?
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:03.400]   And does that, I mean, obviously it wasn't
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:04.840]   broke culture in her case,
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:07.640]   but it was that same kind of drive
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:09.760]   to break the rules,
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:11.240]   move fast and break things,
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:12.880]   fake it till you make it.
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:14.480]   - I don't think that's necessarily the case.
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:16.440]   If you, I don't think you have to be there.
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:18.520]   - Let me ask a different question.
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:20.080]   If they weren't, then fine,
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:23.320]   that if they weren't by chance so jerky
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:24.920]   at tracking more jerks,
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:26.360]   would the internet be better?
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:28.200]   Would it have a better reputation?
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:30.400]   - I don't know.
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:32.240]   I think it doesn't.
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:34.640]   It actually probably helps if you're a jerk.
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:35.800]   I really do think it helps.
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:37.160]   I don't think it's necessary,
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:39.640]   but I think it is helpful if you're a jerk
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:42.240]   to be a founder at a company
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:47.920]   because it helps you stick to your vision.
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:50.720]   And also probably gives you a little
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:55.080]   insulation from feeling,
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:56.520]   from questioning the ethics
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:00.320]   or the ramifications of some of your decisions
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:02.200]   that I think are needed to succeed
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:04.560]   or to really burst out.
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:08.280]   I don't know.
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:15.120]   - Be glad you don't live in South Korea.
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:16.360]   You put this in, didn't you?
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:17.200]   - Yeah, I did.
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:18.040]   I did.
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:20.560]   - South Korean election graphics are next level.
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:21.640]   - You gotta start that one over again.
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:22.480]   It's unbelievable.
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.160]   - This is a bear.
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:27.600]   I don't know what's going on.
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:28.720]   - I know exactly.
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:31.120]   - There's a lot of details.
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:32.120]   - I think it's like this one.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:32.960]   - Yeah.
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:35.800]   - A faceless bear that picks up the candidates
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:36.800]   like their dolls.
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:37.640]   - They're like this.
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:40.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:42.600]   - They, these, this screen technology.
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:44.000]   - Go on, you go on, you get weird water.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.600]   - You see in a lot of places,
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:48.360]   the idea is it's really just a flat screen,
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:49.920]   but you can make it feel like it's 3D
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:51.720]   'cause there's a bend in it.
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:54.000]   And so it feels like the edge, it tricks your eye.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.640]   And so it's kind of cool, but it's just a flat screen.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:00.480]   Here's more with the bear, yeah?
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:03.280]   - Skip down to any of them.
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:05.120]   They're all unbelievable.
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:06.680]   - There's a bear with the rocket.
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:07.760]   - They're all weird.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:10.680]   - What we can do that, we can do this.
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:13.280]   Oh, here's the candidates.
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:14.680]   What, what?
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:17.120]   - You're doing, we're inside.
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:18.440]   - How did they get them?
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:22.520]   Is sign language widespread in Korea or?
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:24.960]   - Well, people are deaf in lots of places, sure.
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:25.800]   - Oh, okay.
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:26.800]   'Cause all of these, by the way,
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:28.680]   have somebody signing in the corner,
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:29.840]   which is interesting.
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:33.760]   Maybe they're just a little more sensitive to that.
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:34.760]   I don't know.
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:39.080]   - Then there's the, I think the next one down,
[02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:41.560]   they're competing, oh, no, this one, yeah,
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:43.000]   that one, they're competing.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.480]   - Well, I don't know, if you ever,
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:45.920]   you probably don't watch the NFL,
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:49.680]   but there is a trend towards these quickie graphics now
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:54.000]   in the NFL, they're incredibly corny and dumb.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.040]   Because they're cheap, they're quickie,
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:59.360]   they're not even as good as this,
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:01.480]   although this isn't the greatest.
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:04.560]   That's, so they're pointing this as a pace,
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:07.440]   playing this as an ice skating race.
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:10.080]   - It doesn't add anything to the information.
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:11.000]   - No. - Zero.
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.280]   - But it makes you watch,
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:15.920]   and you know, some, it's cultural,
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:18.960]   some places, maybe they like the graphics.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:19.800]   They like more graphics.
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:21.600]   I love this screen.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:24.760]   We could do this.
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:26.720]   Should we start doing this?
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:27.560]   Anthony, you should do that, right?
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:28.760]   - Sure, but there.
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:29.760]   - Yeah, or whatever.
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:33.320]   I could have Stacy and Jeff being a curved box
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:36.040]   and they could feel like they're reaching out to grab me.
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:37.080]   - And punching you, they are.
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:37.920]   - Punching me.
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:39.080]   - Oh, watch out. - Punching you.
[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:40.080]   - The doors are closing.
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:42.520]   Oh, oh, oh, wow.
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:47.080]   (laughs)
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:48.520]   But what's funny is this is,
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:50.920]   I mean, you see this all the time in lighthearted stuff,
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:52.560]   but that it, in a light shift.
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:54.160]   - They're the lightest day, I think.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:55.600]   - Yeah.
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:56.600]   Wow.
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:59.480]   - I think this is an example of TV broadcasters,
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:00.720]   even in South Korea,
[02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:03.480]   really don't think much of their audience.
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:04.480]   They think,
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:07.280]   if we don't keep this very exciting.
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:10.040]   You see, then, and by the way, by as a corollary,
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:12.760]   you could see how much we trust and love our audience
[02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:13.840]   and their intelligence,
[02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:15.880]   because we have none of this.
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:17.240]   We're in fact quite a dull show.
[02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:20.120]   We don't attempt it anyway to keep your attention.
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:22.000]   We just kind of slog along.
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.400]   - Oh, we're very, very smart.
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:25.720]   - This is our show right here in that show.
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:30.000]   And then, in other news,
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.360]   did you see this?
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:33.720]   This is good.
[02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:36.720]   The endurance has been found off the coast of Antarctica.
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:37.560]   - I love this.
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:41.600]   - Three miles deep. - Almost perfectly preserved
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:44.200]   because it's so cold and so deep
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:47.640]   and there's so little oxygen at that depth.
[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:50.760]   This is the famous story of Shackleton,
[02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:52.960]   who was trapped in the ice.
[02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:54.720]   The glacier squeezed his boat.
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:55.960]   It was meant to get off.
[02:20:55.960 --> 02:20:59.760]   They hiked for days to get to civilization
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:01.680]   in very daunting odds.
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:03.160]   He saved every one of them.
[02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:04.000]   - Look at that.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000]   - Look at that. - Great leadership.
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:05.840]   - It's perfectly--
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:08.200]   - It's like when you see the Titanic, you know?
[02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:12.560]   Fortunately, treaties mean that they cannot touch
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:14.520]   or remove any items for this ship.
[02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:15.360]   It's just testing.
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:17.240]   - I almost wish it could be up, though.
[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:19.840]   - Well, yeah, I mean--
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:21.200]   - There's that one of the leaders.
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:22.880]   - And I'm in charge now.
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:25.400]   Look at this.
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:26.600]   Isn't that amazing?
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:28.240]   - Oh. - Wow.
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:30.560]   - And it was like an amateur historian who figured it out.
[02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:31.400]   - Yeah.
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:34.320]   It was three miles from where they thought it would be,
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:37.000]   where always or position was last recorded.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.240]   - Shackleton thought his position was.
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:41.440]   - I mean, give him a break.
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:43.720]   It was probably pretty stressful.
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:44.560]   - Yeah.
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:48.760]   - Is this where I parked my car?
[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:51.720]   - Scooter X is telling the story in our chatroom.
[02:21:51.720 --> 02:21:54.200]   Endurance never reached land became trapped
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:55.920]   in the dense ice pack,
[02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:58.120]   and the 28th men on board eventually had no choice
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:00.000]   but to abandon ship after months,
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.320]   spent in makeshift camps on the ice flows
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:03.640]   drifting northwards.
[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:05.720]   The party took to the lifeboats
[02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:07.840]   to reach the inhospitable uninhabited elephant.
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:09.760]   - The foot of a Scooter X's radio is ready to novel
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:10.600]   in the chat.
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:11.680]   - Elephant Island.
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:16.360]   Shackleton and five others then made an extraordinary 800 mile
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:18.600]   open boat journey in the lifeboat.
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:21.040]   James cared to reach South Georgia,
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:22.120]   shackled in two others,
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:23.880]   then crossed the mountainous land
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:25.960]   to the whaling station of stromness.
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:29.520]   From there, Shackleton was able to eventually mount a rescue
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:31.080]   of the men waiting on Elephant Island
[02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:33.800]   and bring them home without loss of life.
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:38.280]   - Pretty impressive. - Pretty impressive.
[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:40.560]   - Pretty impressive. - Pretty impressive.
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:42.280]   - Pretty impressive.
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:46.680]   Let us, unless there's a story that you either of you
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:49.040]   or itchin to talk about,
[02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:52.040]   I think we've done all of your stories
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:52.880]   Jeff.
[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:54.880]   Oh, they're hidden in their--
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:55.720]   - Are you sure?
[02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:58.120]   'Cause we haven't done anything related to TikTok.
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:22:59.920]   - Oh, well, there is a TikTok story.
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:04.920]   - Oh, there is a video food story that's pretty amazing.
[02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:08.320]   - The remote village in Bangladesh.
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:09.200]   - Yeah.
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:11.400]   - So one story actually that we didn't talk about,
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:13.320]   but I think it's very interesting is Amazon
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:16.160]   is launching something called AMP.
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:17.000]   (laughs)
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.320]   Google might have something to say about.
[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:20.720]   But it's not the same.
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:23.400]   Amazon AMP is a live audio app.
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:27.600]   It's kind of like Clubhouse, but you can play music.
[02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:29.040]   - Or you're a DJ.
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:30.400]   - And you can take phone calls.
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:31.240]   - Yeah.
[02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:36.240]   - So it's basically talk radio or music radio in an app.
[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:39.520]   Right now only available in pre-release,
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:40.720]   you have to be invited to use it.
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:42.680]   And I think they only have an iPhone app,
[02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:46.920]   but they will have others pretty exciting.
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:47.880]   - I would do it.
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:49.360]   I think it'd be fun.
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:50.640]   - Yeah.
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.000]   It's free.
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:53.000]   You can spin.
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:53.840]   - Yeah.
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:55.200]   - You can even be Leo Laporton,
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:57.240]   be it his career.
[02:23:57.240 --> 02:24:01.080]   - This is, I think is important as YouTube was
[02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:02.760]   to video creators.
[02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:05.560]   I mean, for instance, I could do my own talk radio show.
[02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:07.520]   I could take phone calls.
[02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:08.360]   - Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:10.800]   I was like, oh, we could have a heck of a good time.
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:11.920]   Kevin and I doing some stuff.
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:13.520]   - Play a song.
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:14.360]   They have to--
[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:15.880]   - You talk up the songs when you were a DJ.
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:17.600]   - Oh yeah, of course you have to.
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:18.440]   Well, you don't have to.
[02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:19.600]   It's a terrible thing to do.
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:23.240]   It ruins the song, but it makes you feel pretty damn good.
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:26.640]   You got tens of millions of licensed songs
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:28.640]   from the big three music companies,
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:31.680]   a long list of independent music companies.
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:33.920]   CD Baby is in there as well.
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:38.320]   No subscription, no additional hardware, no editing.
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:40.000]   It's right through the iPhone.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.020]   Fascinating.
[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:46.120]   They're gonna be shows from Nicki Minaj.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:50.720]   She's gonna bring her radio show, Queen Radio to Amp.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:55.320]   Pusha T, Tenash, Lindsay Sterling, The Violinist,
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.080]   Travis Barker, Lil Yachty, and Big Boy.
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:01.360]   Well-known personalities, Tefi Passoa
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:04.400]   and Nikita Dragoon, popular radio host, radios,
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:07.720]   Zach Sane, Kate Corbett, Christian James,
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:12.720]   and Guy Raz, who took his, how I built this,
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:17.160]   to wonder to Amazon, they own it.
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:21.040]   So to me, this is really bigger than maybe you might think.
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:24.560]   This is Amazon saying, just like Spotify, yeah,
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:27.240]   we wanna own the audio landscape.
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:29.680]   The podcasting, I think, has been done.
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:30.760]   I mean, you've done it now.
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:31.600]   It's done.
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:32.440]   This is the next thing.
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:33.360]   Somebody's looking for the next thing.
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:35.200]   Yeah, this is clubhouse.
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:37.160]   This is clubhouse and more.
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:40.680]   I think it's so far beyond clubhouse.
[02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:42.360]   Oh, I agree.
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:43.200]   I agree.
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:45.280]   Because you play music.
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:46.880]   Everybody could be a radio station.
[02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:48.440]   Yeah, but they focus on music,
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:49.760]   but I don't think it's just music.
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:51.360]   I mean, I really think you could do anything.
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:52.200]   Yeah.
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:26:00.800]   You also have, can take callers with control over
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:02.400]   who speaks and when.
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:04.040]   You can pre-plan and schedule your shows,
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:06.600]   listen to songs in real time with your audience.
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:08.760]   They plan according to Amazon to add even more
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:11.600]   from Alexa integrations to social sharing,
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:14.600]   to innovative new search and discovery features.
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:16.800]   Man, I wish I'd get, I'd love to get an invite.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.360]   This seems like, I really think this might be the future.
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:22.880]   Yeah, you think what you and Kevin could do?
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:25.600]   Yeah, I am.
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:27.680]   We already have a call in.
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:28.520]   Do you?
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:29.360]   You could have more.
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:30.200]   More.
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:37.560]   So interesting play by Amazon for this.
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:42.560]   Onamp.com, O-N-A-M-P.com.
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:47.920]   And it is an iOS app.
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:51.240]   I guess you do your show in iOS.
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:55.960]   Oh no, I want to do it in the pen tray.
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:57.160]   (mimics drum roll)
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:00.160]   Well, but this is pre-release, so it's right now it's.
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:03.400]   Stream your own radio show with the songs you love.
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:05.060]   It's your mix and your mic.
[02:27:06.060 --> 02:27:08.320]   (humming)
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:14.060]   I don't know, Clubhouse is kind of no longer
[02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:17.620]   the flavor of the month, so maybe this is the next big thing.
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:20.460]   Or maybe it's Korean election graphics, who knows?
[02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:23.860]   Get ready, your picks of the week are next.
[02:27:23.860 --> 02:27:24.700]   Comment up.
[02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:25.540]   Boy and girl.
[02:27:25.540 --> 02:27:29.820]   But first a word from our sponsor's cash fly.
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:32.700]   The show is quite literally brought to you by CashFly,

[02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:39.060]   We wouldn't be able to do the shows without CashFly.
[02:27:39.060 --> 02:27:40.180]   Thank you.
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:41.540]   Thank you, CashFly.

[02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:43.340]   CashFly's giving away a complimentary detailed analysis
[02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:45.940]   of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:49.500]   See if you are overpaying 20% or more.
[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:52.020]   If you have a CDN, bring your CDN bill
[02:29:52.020 --> 02:29:54.620]   and your usage trends to CashFly, if you don't,
[02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:59.220]   now you really need to go to twit.cash fly.com
[02:29:59.220 --> 02:30:01.900]   and talk to them, it's just, that's what I did
[02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:03.260]   and let them see how they can help you
[02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:05.100]   and I boy, I never looked back.
[02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:10.100]   twit.cash fly.com, they've been a great support.
[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:13.220]   We'd love it if you'd take advantage of this,
[02:30:13.220 --> 02:30:17.580]   offer twit.cash fly.com.
[02:30:17.580 --> 02:30:21.660]   All right, let's see, what does Stacy have
[02:30:21.660 --> 02:30:23.860]   for her thing of the week?
[02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:27.140]   I have got some good stuff for you.
[02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:29.140]   Good stuff.
[02:30:29.140 --> 02:30:32.860]   Ow, sorry.
[02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:34.500]   Okay, that's not opening.
[02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:37.180]   I've got a different good stuff for you.
[02:30:37.180 --> 02:30:42.180]   This is a USB powered air quality monitor sensor.
[02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:45.020]   Okay.
[02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:49.300]   From a company called Piaera, this is called the Canary.
[02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:51.700]   It has a silly accent, but it's the Canary.
[02:30:51.700 --> 02:30:54.140]   (laughs)
[02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:56.140]   Here, I'll show you the...
[02:30:56.140 --> 02:30:58.420]   It's Anastasia.
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:30:59.260]   Canarsi.
[02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:00.260]   Canarsi.
[02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:01.100]   Canarsi.
[02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:01.940]   Canarsi.
[02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:03.260]   Canarsi.
[02:31:03.260 --> 02:31:04.100]   Canarsi.
[02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:05.100]   Canary.
[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:05.940]   What's...
[02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:08.140]   That's not an accent, that's a long A.
[02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:09.900]   Yeah, you know.
[02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:10.900]   Canary.
[02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:11.740]   Canary.
[02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:13.540]   Because there's a lot of other companies
[02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:14.380]   with air.
[02:31:14.380 --> 02:31:15.380]   Air.
[02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:16.220]   Canary.
[02:31:16.220 --> 02:31:17.380]   Canary.
[02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:18.220]   Canary.
[02:31:18.220 --> 02:31:19.060]   Canary.
[02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:19.900]   How long A is A?
[02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:20.740]   Canary.
[02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:21.580]   Canary.
[02:31:21.580 --> 02:31:22.420]   Canary.
[02:31:22.420 --> 02:31:23.260]   Canary.
[02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:24.100]   Canary.
[02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:25.420]   Canary.
[02:31:25.420 --> 02:31:26.260]   Anyway.
[02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:28.700]   (laughs)
[02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:29.540]   This sensor.
[02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:33.380]   This is a little bit more professional for your home.
[02:31:33.380 --> 02:31:36.380]   People use this in enterprise settings,
[02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:40.060]   but I was testing it because inside is a chip
[02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:44.620]   that is performing actual most,
[02:31:44.620 --> 02:31:47.940]   let me back up, most air quality sensors
[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:49.980]   check for estimates.
[02:31:49.980 --> 02:31:52.860]   They basically shine a little laser light,
[02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:55.020]   they count the particulates in the air
[02:31:55.020 --> 02:31:55.980]   using the laser lights,
[02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:58.020]   and then they're like, ah, this has about 20.
[02:31:58.020 --> 02:32:00.180]   And then it's X part per billion, right?
[02:32:00.180 --> 02:32:02.220]   They make their assessment on this.
[02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:04.900]   This actually does some computer vision
[02:32:04.900 --> 02:32:08.260]   on the device to get the exact count.
[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:09.340]   Oh, am I in the right place?
[02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:10.180]   Is this?
[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:11.940]   No, that's a security product.
[02:32:11.940 --> 02:32:14.260]   See, this is why it's confusing.
[02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:17.780]   Yeah, it's P-I-E-R-A systems.
[02:32:18.820 --> 02:32:20.780]   What this company did is built a chip,
[02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:22.660]   and then they were like, well, what the heck can we do this?
[02:32:22.660 --> 02:32:23.500]   What does this?
[02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:24.340]   Wow.
[02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:27.900]   We're able to, at low battery power,
[02:32:27.900 --> 02:32:29.620]   do some machine learning that can give you
[02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:34.460]   exact particulate measurements as opposed to estimates.
[02:32:34.460 --> 02:32:37.420]   So this is interesting because it's an exact measurement
[02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:38.460]   of particulates.
[02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:39.980]   So the purple is an estimate.
[02:32:39.980 --> 02:32:42.820]   It's not doing the same thing.
[02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:45.740]   Yes, the purple is a good example of an estimate.
[02:32:45.740 --> 02:32:49.860]   It's not exactly tracking your particular matter.
[02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:51.140]   I mean, it's still very accurate.
[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:52.380]   I mean, it's good enough for you.
[02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:55.220]   I have purples inside and outside from the,
[02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:58.860]   when we had the fires and it was really hard to breathe.
[02:32:58.860 --> 02:32:59.700]   Okay.
[02:32:59.700 --> 02:33:01.180]   So you could get one of these and test it
[02:33:01.180 --> 02:33:05.140]   for how much better it is or how much more accurate it is.
[02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:10.140]   And it also, I believe pulls data more often than purple,
[02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:14.540]   which can be useful simply because you want your data
[02:33:14.540 --> 02:33:17.420]   to be sampling as often as possible
[02:33:17.420 --> 02:33:19.540]   because when their quality gets bad,
[02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:21.460]   you want to be like, oh, I know now,
[02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:24.180]   instead of breathing it for 30 minutes when it's not.
[02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:26.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:33:26.180 --> 02:33:27.900]   Well, for the next fire.
[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:32.900]   So you don't plug it into a computer.
[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:38.060]   So these, no, these are designed to be plugged into
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:40.500]   access points, Wi-Fi access points.
[02:33:40.500 --> 02:33:43.380]   They've got a deal with like Aruba and other places.
[02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:47.700]   I plugged mine into a, just a,
[02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:52.460]   an outlet, what are they called?
[02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:54.860]   I just plug it into a USB thing.
[02:33:54.860 --> 02:33:56.300]   And then don't, thank you.
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:57.820]   Yes.
[02:33:57.820 --> 02:33:59.740]   Power supply, thank you.
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:04.140]   Stacey on IOT and these battery packs.
[02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:04.980]   Okay.
[02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:06.780]   No, no, no, no, just the power supply
[02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:08.700]   that's then plugs into the wall.
[02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:09.540]   Oh, okay.
[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:10.380]   A USB hub.
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:12.700]   No.
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:13.900]   Huh?
[02:34:13.900 --> 02:34:16.260]   Just the power supply, that's good.
[02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:19.140]   And then does it use Bluetooth to talk to it?
[02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:20.300]   How does it, what is it talking to you?
[02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:21.140]   It does.
[02:34:21.140 --> 02:34:21.980]   It uses Bluetooth.
[02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:22.660]   Okay.
[02:34:22.660 --> 02:34:24.940]   Sorry, I should have explained that.
[02:34:24.940 --> 02:34:25.780]   Nice.
[02:34:25.780 --> 02:34:27.380]   And it contains an ESP32.
[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:29.340]   Everybody's favorite alternative chip design.
[02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:30.180]   Oh, yes.
[02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:31.020]   Do you do?
[02:34:31.020 --> 02:34:31.860]   Do you do?
[02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:32.700]   200 bucks.
[02:34:32.700 --> 02:34:33.980]   So it's not cheap, but I think it's purple.
[02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:37.100]   No, this isn't really for people.
[02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:37.940]   Yeah.
[02:34:37.940 --> 02:34:40.140]   I think it's a really neat device.
[02:34:40.140 --> 02:34:41.460]   And I think it's a neat concept
[02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:43.420]   because I'm a sucker for people who are like,
[02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:46.020]   oh, I built some cool silicon technology.
[02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:48.420]   Let me not sell that because that's commodity
[02:34:48.420 --> 02:34:50.300]   and sell like the little device.
[02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:52.980]   Blink did that and then was bought by Amazon, for example.
[02:34:52.980 --> 02:34:53.980]   Right, right.
[02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:58.820]   Nate from pearassystems.com, P-I-E-R-A.
[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:02.860]   Canary A1 for Aruba, oh, wait, I got the one
[02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:04.260]   for Aruba Access Points.
[02:35:04.260 --> 02:35:07.820]   So anyway, they kept saying Aruba Access Points is also,
[02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:10.100]   that was $200.
[02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:11.980]   That's just $250.
[02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:13.900]   That's the one you have, I think,
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:15.660]   connected to cloud using Wi-Fi Bluetooth,
[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:17.740]   ethernet, and a monitor here from everywhere.
[02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:19.220]   Cool.
[02:35:19.220 --> 02:35:20.220]   Do they have them?
[02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:21.740]   So one of the things I like about purple
[02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:25.020]   is you could be part of a larger map of air quality.
[02:35:25.020 --> 02:35:27.340]   They do not do that.
[02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:28.180]   They do not have that.
[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:29.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:29.180 --> 02:35:31.260]   I mean, because part of this, they want to design,
[02:35:31.260 --> 02:35:32.980]   this is for like companies who are,
[02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:34.380]   like if you're a small business owner
[02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:36.980]   and you're like, let's check out our indoor air quality.
[02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:38.740]   This is a solution for you for that.
[02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:42.340]   Jeff Jarvis, your number or pick?
[02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:44.180]   I'm going to do a really quick one.
[02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:45.180]   Yeah.
[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:48.300]   So Matt Corlion is one of my favorite people on Twitter,
[02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:49.820]   a really, really smart guy.
[02:35:49.820 --> 02:35:52.100]   He's the general manager of Boston.com,
[02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:53.500]   which is the Boston Globe.
[02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:54.540]   But cloud forms there.
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:56.860]   He's a was a Neiman fellow at Harvard.
[02:35:56.860 --> 02:35:59.340]   He teaches journalism with the Harvard Extension.
[02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:00.860]   We were having a discussion on Twitter,
[02:36:00.860 --> 02:36:03.940]   as we do about wonky media things this week.
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:06.540]   The Wall Street Journal did a supposed exposé
[02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:09.220]   about ads misplaced in the Gannett Network.
[02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:10.700]   And they said there were billions of ads
[02:36:10.700 --> 02:36:11.700]   and I said this ridiculous.
[02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:12.900]   And Matt and I were going back and forth.
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:14.380]   And then Matt came in, Leo,
[02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:16.740]   this is going to hit you with a solar plexus.
[02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:18.420]   Like it did me.
[02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:21.340]   And he said, unrelated, I find it so bizarre
[02:36:21.340 --> 02:36:22.900]   that you replied in my tweets.
[02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:26.980]   When I was in high school and college,
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:30.340]   I would listen to you on this week in tech with me at a report.
[02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:32.980]   You guys were just effectively fictional characters
[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:34.060]   to me at that point.
[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:35.740]   Yes, we still are.
[02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:38.740]   I've been around that long.
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:43.060]   You want to see Anna Stasia W. Higgenbotham.
[02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:44.460]   He was in high school.
[02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:46.260]   It's like, that makes me so old.
[02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:48.540]   But the worst thing is, and it happened just the other day
[02:36:48.540 --> 02:36:52.980]   on Reddit where people say, is he still alive?
[02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:55.100]   Is he still around?
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:58.100]   I remember him from when I was in high school, whatever happened.
[02:36:58.100 --> 02:36:59.540]   Or worse, almost.
[02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:02.340]   Whatever happened to him.
[02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:02.900]   Oh, shh.
[02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:03.940]   I know.
[02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:04.420]   I know.
[02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:05.660]   That's all right.
[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:08.980]   You know, that's the price of fame and fortune.
[02:37:08.980 --> 02:37:10.060]   What can I say?
[02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:10.580]   It is.
[02:37:10.580 --> 02:37:12.340]   So is that a number?
[02:37:12.340 --> 02:37:13.460]   That's just an--
[02:37:13.460 --> 02:37:14.420]   That's old.
[02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:15.140]   We're just old.
[02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:15.860]   OK.
[02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:16.980]   Yeah, I could have done another.
[02:37:16.980 --> 02:37:20.140]   He's forgotten the number because he's old.
[02:37:20.140 --> 02:37:20.940]   Yes.
[02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:24.100]   The man from the future, visionary life of John von Neumann.
[02:37:24.100 --> 02:37:25.020]   I think you guys will like it.
[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:25.980]   I want to get that book.
[02:37:25.980 --> 02:37:27.220]   Thank you for the recommending that.
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:27.740]   That's great.
[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:28.540]   That is a good wreck.
[02:37:28.540 --> 02:37:28.820]   Yeah.
[02:37:28.820 --> 02:37:29.660]   I listened to it.
[02:37:29.660 --> 02:37:30.660]   Yeah.
[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:33.700]   Added to my wish list.
[02:37:33.700 --> 02:37:34.940]   Very much so.
[02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:41.740]   Which plan do you use on Audible?
[02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:46.420]   They've been trying to get me off it forever because I signed up
[02:37:46.420 --> 02:37:48.180]   in 2000 when they had a--
[02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:50.500]   I think it was-- they called it the light listener
[02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:50.780]   plane.
[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:52.580]   It was two books a month.
[02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:54.900]   And it was fairly inexpensive.
[02:37:54.900 --> 02:37:57.460]   And I even got-- I even got email from the founder
[02:37:57.460 --> 02:38:00.700]   and stuff saying, you know, when you--
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:01.500]   you sign up.
[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:07.940]   That was-- you know, like, you want to pay more?
[02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:09.020]   No.
[02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:10.900]   I have ideal.
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:11.620]   I have ideal.
[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:14.700]   But when I wanted to do my language lessons on it,
[02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:20.500]   I needed a lot of tokens, whatever they call it.
[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:23.180]   And so I signed up for the annual 124.
[02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:23.700]   Yes.
[02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:24.780]   So it's about to come do it.
[02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:26.260]   I'm going to suddenly get a whoop.
[02:38:26.260 --> 02:38:27.300]   How much is-- how much is that?
[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:27.780]   I'll go through it.
[02:38:27.780 --> 02:38:28.420]   I'd have to curiosity.
[02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:29.620]   I'd forget.
[02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:30.020]   I'd forget.
[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:31.900]   But it's always-- it's always basically about 10 bucks.
[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:32.300]   I think it was like--
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:36.340]   Yeah, it was 10 bucks a month for two monthly credits.
[02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:37.900]   No, that's-- it's about 10 bucks.
[02:38:37.900 --> 02:38:39.380]   So when I buy the three extra credits,
[02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:40.660]   which I do frequently--
[02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:41.460]   Yeah.
[02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:44.100]   --very frequently, it's, I think, an extra 10 bucks
[02:38:44.100 --> 02:38:45.380]   for the extra three credits.
[02:38:45.380 --> 02:38:47.860]   So no, it's still 10 bucks per credit.
[02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:49.300]   I mean, nine something per credit.
[02:38:49.300 --> 02:38:52.060]   Yeah.
[02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:55.220]   Well, I still love you Audible.
[02:38:55.220 --> 02:38:55.940]   That's all I can say.
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:57.860]   And they are also-- we should mention a sponsor.
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:04.060]   I wish I probably should always say when we talk about them.
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:05.580]   Thank you.
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:08.500]   I'm not going to do a pick because I'm too lazy.
[02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:09.100]   Lazy.
[02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:10.060]   You're just lazy and old.
[02:39:10.060 --> 02:39:11.420]   And it's 5 o'clock.
[02:39:11.420 --> 02:39:12.780]   And it's 5 o'clock.
[02:39:12.780 --> 02:39:14.060]   I already ordered by Sushi.
[02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:15.700]   The Sushi takes forever.
[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:17.140]   I already ordered it.
[02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:20.060]   The sun has gone over the yard arm.
[02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:23.340]   I thank you so much, Stacey, or as we know,
[02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:25.900]   or Anastasia W. Higginbotham.
[02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:29.540]   Or StaceyOnIOT.com.
[02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:32.500]   She does the podcast with Kevin Tofel
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:35.700]   and has a great newsletter, too, that's free to all.
[02:39:35.700 --> 02:39:38.500]   So is the site, please.
[02:39:38.500 --> 02:39:41.180]   This poor woman starving.
[02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:43.020]   Just join.
[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:44.540]   Join, join.
[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:45.180]   Do something.
[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:47.060]   StaceyOnIOT.com.
[02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:48.580]   Do you have a premium membership?
[02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:49.020]   No.
[02:39:49.020 --> 02:39:51.980]   You don't even-- you don't charge.
[02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:54.060]   I don't charge-- well, I charge my advertisers.
[02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:55.900]   So if you feel like really special,
[02:39:55.900 --> 02:39:57.820]   you can click on my advertisers.
[02:39:57.820 --> 02:39:58.900]   They are a good group of people.
[02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:00.180]   There you go.
[02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:01.540]   So that's about it.
[02:40:01.540 --> 02:40:04.980]   That's the way to do it.
[02:40:04.980 --> 02:40:08.020]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis is, of course, the director
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:11.100]   of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:15.740]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[02:40:15.740 --> 02:40:18.860]   at the City University of New York.
[02:40:18.860 --> 02:40:21.500]   Ray Crock called him a nickel millionaire.
[02:40:21.500 --> 02:40:23.940]   But he's our nickel millionaire.
[02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:24.780]   That's the end.
[02:40:24.780 --> 02:40:25.620]   Oh, yeah.
[02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:28.020]   At least 10 cents by now.
[02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:31.020]   John sees what I'm looking at right now.
[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:36.460]   I didn't realize it's already time to spring forward.
[02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:37.140]   So that means--
[02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:39.740]   You think you just lost two hours of your life listening to us?
[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:41.020]   You're about to lose another hour.
[02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:43.180]   Another one's going away.
[02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:44.260]   Kiddo.
[02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:46.620]   March 13th, we spring forward.
[02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:52.460]   So if you want to watch this show right now,
[02:40:52.460 --> 02:40:57.220]   it's on the air at 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern.
[02:40:57.220 --> 02:41:00.060]   And it used to be 2,200.
[02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:03.860]   But we're going to spring forward, which means relatively
[02:41:03.860 --> 02:41:08.260]   to UTC, we're going to spring backwards.
[02:41:08.260 --> 02:41:09.620]   Or it's going to go backwards.
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:10.540]   We're going to go forward.
[02:41:10.540 --> 02:41:12.700]   So it's 2,100.
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:14.500]   Your time's time of you.
[02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:16.500]   It's very relativistic.
[02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:18.860]   It took me a long time to understand
[02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:20.940]   that if we set our clocks forward,
[02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:25.740]   that in effect, we are starting an hour earlier
[02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:28.540]   in the rest of the world.
[02:41:28.540 --> 02:41:32.500]   I think that even as I say it, doesn't make any sense.
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:33.940]   Oh, it hurts my brain.
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:41.140]   If you are, however, as in the UK,
[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:45.660]   because ever since, I think it was Obama, where we decided,
[02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:47.980]   no, we want to do it earlier and later.
[02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:51.860]   So the rest of the world, it's not for a couple of weeks.
[02:41:51.860 --> 02:41:54.260]   That even makes it worse.
[02:41:54.260 --> 02:41:55.940]   It really does.
[02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:59.220]   But you know, it's even worse talking about it for five minutes.
[02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:00.620]   Let's go.
[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:02.220]   All right, thank you, everybody.
[02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:05.620]   Come back here next week at some time or other.
[02:42:05.620 --> 02:42:07.140]   And we'll be here for you.
[02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:08.260]   Have a wonderful week.
[02:42:08.260 --> 02:42:10.740]   And that's it for this week in Google.
[02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:11.940]   Bye-bye.
[02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:14.380]   Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astor magazine.
[02:42:14.380 --> 02:42:17.380]   And each week, I'm joined by Tarek Malek, the editor in chief,
[02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:19.220]   over at space.com.
[02:42:19.220 --> 02:42:21.260]   In our new This Week in Space podcast,
[02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:24.100]   every Friday, Tarek and I take a deep dive into the stories
[02:42:24.100 --> 02:42:25.660]   that define the new space age.
[02:42:25.660 --> 02:42:26.860]   What's NASA up to?
[02:42:26.860 --> 02:42:29.540]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:31.620]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:33.100]   When are those coming on?
[02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:35.340]   What the heck has Elon Musk done now?
[02:42:35.340 --> 02:42:38.020]   In addition to all the latest and greatest in space exploration,
[02:42:38.020 --> 02:42:41.020]   we'll take an occasional look at bits of spaceflight history
[02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:43.620]   that you probably never heard of and all with an eye
[02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:46.020]   towards having a good time along the way.
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:47.700]   Check us out on your favorite pod catcher.

[02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:54.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:42:54.460 --> 02:42:57.040]   (upbeat music)
