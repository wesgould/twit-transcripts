[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.200]   Slash Twig. It's time for this week in Google or Twig, as it is colloquially known by the
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.400]   children on the street. We welcome back ladies and gentlemen and I'm just glad to put this rumor
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.480]   to rest. Gina Trappani. Who is not gone? No. She's bailed out.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.080]   Jeff Jarvis also. Gina wasn't here last week. I it's my fault because I neglected to say
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.720]   Gina Trappani is on assignment. And I neglected to say that I was on vacation.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.720]   I wouldn't be on the show. There were lots of rumors that I got I got bounced.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.440]   Now they're both lying to you suspended for bad behavior.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.480]   Given she tweeted my email address. We'll see how she got. I docked Leo.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.680]   It was not very not very scandalous or exciting. I was just on vacation and I and I didn't say
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.280]   anything. You learn how to cook balls. Your mom is a meatball. I did. My family came to visit
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.280]   us in San Diego and I learned how to cook my mom's meatballs. So but I really missed doing
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.440]   the show and thrilled to be back. And no truth to the rumor that you you turned down Yahoo for the
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:38.640]   CEO gig. Well, I know. I can't I can't comment on that. Gina blogs at smarterware.org. She's the
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.800]   author of Think Up App, which is a great Twitter analysis tool used by the White House among others.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.760]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York. You might have seen
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.880]   him on CNN this week talking eloquently about NBC fail. He also is the author of public parts,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.240]   which is available bookstores everywhere and blogs at buzz machine.com. Now I got all the
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.480]   plugs out of the way. You were you look great, by the way, in a in a coat and tie, Jeff.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.040]   Fair. Very sharp. I know this is my. What is that circles? Yeah. I bought it. I didn't get
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.160]   it for free. I bought it to Google give shop. Nice. I'll dress up next week for you.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.760]   So it's nice. That's the only one in a t-shirt.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.960]   I'm underneath. I'm wearing a t-shirt. Oh, okay. Okay. I'm working at home today and at
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   summertime, so I'm wearing my shorts. Was it was worse? What was worse? Oh, no.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.480]   Nobby needs. Don't show those on CNN. Oh, no. The world is not ready. You're not going to see
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.080]   my knees. So what? What was that like? You were on CNN talking about NBC and you've been very
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.120]   outspoken in NBC's handling of the Olympics. And yet, as many have pointed out, as
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.600]   again, in the and the scene I call him, as many have pointed out, the ratings and the revenue
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.200]   are great, right? And and the reviews by the users according to Pew did a big survey this week. So,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.160]   eat that crow, but I don't think it's not about everyone loving it. I think the question is that
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.680]   you have super fans of sports who are clearly ill served. There's a word I will use and we use
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.080]   it a lot on this show and it applies, I think, to this stewardship. Yes. That there are some things
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.600]   that you do as a network that, hey, it's my show I could do whatever I want with.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.520]   And then there are some things that are bigger than you. Twitter has stewardship, for instance,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.040]   over this internet dial tone, this information nervous system that it runs. It is more than just
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.440]   a private company at some point. NBC and the Olympics, this is stewardship. You are the sole
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.920]   channel of the Olympics, the sole legal channel of the Olympics in the United States. You have a
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.840]   higher duty. Yes. That's simply making money or getting ratings. Yeah. But I also think for the
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.240]   smart business, it's in these days, it's bad business to screw your customers in the long run
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.360]   because and this is what's changed. They will have a choice. Yes. Yes. And they will talk about you.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.520]   Without choice, NBC has a monopoly. And right now, you know, most people don't know of any other
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:24.880]   way to get anything better. Tunnel Bear. Tunnel Bear. I think he said, spoon, tunnel bear.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:33.520]   But you're right. But that's a small minority of people who know that. But what's what I'm saying
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.120]   is as time changes, that's why the music industry finally had to bow was that more and more people
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.640]   learned to pirate because of their stupid policies. And finally, I had to say, I also have been struggling
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.280]   to write a post I haven't gotten done yet because I just haven't been I have been disciplined. I've
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.360]   been hanging around t-shirts and shorts. It's summertime. Just relax. But about the responsibilities
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.000]   of a platform, which we talked about in last week's show, comes to the Guy Adams case of the
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.680]   user kicked off Twitter. It comes to the notion of I think newspapers acting more like platforms
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.480]   and the responsibilities that come. Part of this discussion too is advertising support.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.440]   Is the question that some ask and say, well, it's impossible. So this is why app.net
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:21.280]   as you pointed us to an email, Leo, is trying to start a user supported Twitter. Seth
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.320]   Golden wrote a post this week arguing for just that. If you know the old not very economic argument
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.040]   that if in people paid $10, we'd be rich. That's fine. But I'm not I've not given up on advertising
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.920]   support because I think that that it's necessary for media. It's a better model without it will
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.760]   have more well, less content and more content behind pay walls. And that's bad for all of us.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.240]   The reason that you have to make it work you do every day is you have the trust of your audience
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.200]   in your hand. And if you violated by selling out to bed advertisers or by hawking advertisers
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.040]   outside of that, they'll they'll savage you and leave you. But you maintain your trust and
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.480]   the same thing as possible for media and the same thing as possible for Twitter, I think.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:12.720]   And you see as well that NBC doesn't have to just do the things that they used to do the years ago.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.640]   They can super serve their viewers and still win, I think.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.760]   They pay a lot for the Olympics. It's very expensive. They do.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.280]   Matt and Meredith have to have their hairdressers, their car drivers, their bodyguards. This is not
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.680]   easy. They got to pay Ryan Seacrest Ryan Seacrest alone. But I believe I still believe in the
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.960]   problems, there's no way to test this. One way or the other, you're proving a negative.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:44.640]   I would bet that if they showed the hot events live that it would cause more social chatter about
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.000]   them among those who saw them and that would cause more viewership to catch up on it at prime time.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.160]   And I guess what I'm saying is they will never ever find that out unless forced to.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:04.800]   What we'll force them to is widespread internet malfeasance as people pirating it, doing it
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.920]   without their permission. They can be very widespread. I mean, seriously, tunnel bear, for those who
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.400]   don't know it, it's a very, very easy way to VPN into UK server. And it's free.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.080]   And you can watch the BBC ad free. You can watch the iPad. Everything.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:26.240]   The iPad players magnificent. Just amazing. And you can watch BBC live then too in the UK channels.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.840]   It's very easy. I think it's $4.99 a month for unlimited. So yeah, they've made it an incredibly
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.960]   easy app, really pretty. And you just slip on and off and on and off. And that's it. Still,
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.720]   it's going to be a tiny number. Just as the number, the argument is the number on Twitter
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.600]   confetching like me is also very small. Wow, this tunnel bear school. I didn't know that.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.920]   So what's it's free to have done? Should the BBC have allowed for people to pay to watch?
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.360]   So if you had a cable login, you could have watched most of the events live.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.600]   Well, I'm not sure. So I have a cable login. I'm paying for Xfinity. I have all the NBC channels.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.920]   And Xfinity has a special on-demand Olympics on demand that is ad free. And they say everything
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:17.120]   is there. I really wanted to see Ennis who won the heptathlon. I saw her final amazing 800 meter run
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:24.400]   where she led beginning to end, didn't need to. She'd already practically won. And I wanted to
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.960]   see the other events, Javelin Schoppert. I thought this is really the Olympics, this heptathlon.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.080]   Seven events, you have to be an all-around athlete. I was so impressed by her and I cannot find it
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.200]   anywhere. Okay, so they're not actually streaming. Well, maybe it's me, but it's not easy.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.880]   Well, it's not a stream live. Not all of it's taped later. Not all of it's a rerun on the web. So
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.040]   you can watch a live. But then you got to know what exists, which is really hard to do.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.440]   But I think there's a silver lining for the networks in here as I've been arguing that there's no
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.880]   need for channels, channels are a false curation. So why don't we go to the channel? Well, the truth
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.440]   is the viewers do want the channel. They want to be able to sit on the couch and watch the best
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.840]   of the live as it occurs. That's good news for old fashioned channels, which still hire revenue.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.520]   So the odd thing here is to me, NBC is devaluing his channel. I still salute NBC for what they
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.400]   do by putting all this stuff up online. We need a better kind of TV guide to it, but that's a UI
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.800]   problem. We'll figure that out. Well, we also, the fact that they're owned by Comcast,
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:34.160]   the mixing there of different conflicting points of view bugs me a little bit. I mean,
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.320]   Comcast is never going to get the, because Comcast doesn't want to be an internet service
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.480]   provider. They want to be a premium content provider. So their business model does not allow for this.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.800]   So I don't think NBC ever is going to get the idea because their owners won't.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.560]   The bigger idea here is whether content is still a business model. The idea that you can,
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.440]   and we've talked about this in the show, too. I hope so, because that's what I do.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.440]   I keep every time we do it. I argue back that you're not. Your relationships,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.480]   your community, your community. You're the main poll we all dance around.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.680]   Right. I'm the maple.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.920]   Not a very tall one. All right. Well, grab your ribbons, kids.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.440]   We got some Google news. There's some Google news. Where do you want to start?
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.320]   I'll let you pick Gina. Since you were gone last week, you get the
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.200]   shoes. Well, something just broke today. The Google hosted a search breakfast for press,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.560]   and they announced a couple of things. One of the things that they announced is that they're
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.920]   launching a field trial that you can opt into. This just interests me because it's a product thing.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:43.840]   You can opt into seeing your Gmail messages in Google search results.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.200]   I love that.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.360]   Yeah, I do, too. You opt in, and then you search for something on Google,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.240]   and there's a little module on top right that shows Gmail messages in your account that you're
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.800]   signed into, which also contain that keyword. I thought this was great. Google Desktop used to
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.720]   do this. It makes sense. It goes along with Search+World.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.560]   All the creepy police are out.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.920]   So many people who I really respect and who are smart and good,
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.040]   were saying, "This is a terrible idea. Why would you mix public information with private
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:23.120]   information? This is going to freak people out. No one wants this." I was surprised,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:30.240]   because I tweeted this. I forget user experience just from the purely from the perspective of
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:37.280]   user education. We want to encourage Google to expose all the contextually relevant personal data
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.960]   it has about you in its search results, which is this most used interface,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.840]   just so that users get used to the idea, "Google has this information about me, and it's showing
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.440]   it back to me in these different interfaces." This is what the privacy policy was consolidation
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.000]   was all about, right? So now you have search and Gmail tied together.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.120]   And I don't know. I think it's a good thing. I opted into the field trial,
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.800]   and they enabled it for my account right away. I've been using Dr. Go for a while now.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.960]   So I went back to Google and gave it a try.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.840]   Yeah, I like it. I like it a lot. It makes a lot of sense. It goes along with Search+World.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.080]   It does not--the field trial at least does not support Google Apps account. So it has to be a
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.200]   vanilla Google account. And the trial page says that they might not be able to let everyone in,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.880]   and you have to kind of apply, and then they send you a message letting you know whether or not
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.520]   you're in. But I think this is a good direction. And I was surprised that so many people thought
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.200]   that it was such a terrible idea. I mean, like I said, Google Desktop, which has since been
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.480]   discontinued, this is what it did for you. But you had to install it on your desktop, obviously.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:51.680]   Gina, it's such a knee jerk reflex now. Oh my God, my email's there. Yeah, it's on your page.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.320]   It's on the same exact browser that your email's in anyway. It's only for you.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.960]   If you're looking for this restaurant, you might find there's an old reference to it.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.160]   Well, hallelujah. But now this knee jerk--oh my God, change is bad. Not just change is bad,
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.600]   but anything having to do with me is bad. And that holds back so much potential progress.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.360]   Yeah, it's funny. I'm usually the privacy one kind of here. I'm never kind of totally with Jeff
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.440]   on this. But on this one, Jeff, I'm completely with you. It's like, why wouldn't you show this
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.160]   information? You have it. They're doing it over SSL, so it's encrypted. Of course, people are saying
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.760]   what if someone's looking over your shoulder or you do this on a shared computer. But if you're
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:36.160]   signed into Google, it makes sense for Google to show you relevant results from all the context,
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.840]   data it has for you. And why wouldn't it do it in search results? I mean, that's the most popular
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.520]   and most used Google interface that they have. And it's just good for, I think, for users to have
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.880]   an awareness. Like, yes, Google has this private information. This is public information on the web.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.920]   And I don't think mixing them is such a big deal. It's not in line. I mean, it's off to the
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:03.200]   right. You don't have to turn this on. I mean, you opt in. You join. You join on it. So, so I don't
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.920]   know if this is going to become default. That's a use case. You could imagine it being handy for
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.600]   because that's part of what Google has to do in these cases is sell it. Does it say folks,
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.800]   this is why we're doing it because it's going to give you benefit in your life.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:21.760]   I mean, I constantly, I mean, for me, it's just kind of a unified search box. I'm constantly
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:28.000]   searching my Gmail for messages, for links, for words. So for me, it's like, oh, hey, if this works
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.720]   really well, I'll go to one search box and get everything in one shot. If I'm looking for a link
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.840]   that a Neil emailed me, if I search in Google, I can get either his message or the link itself.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.600]   Let me show you one that a couple of problems I have with it. I mean, I love it. And I turn it on.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:50.080]   First of all, the Google results page is now vastly overloaded. So I searched for Australia.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.800]   So on the right, I'm getting the knowledge graph of gold medals, Australia is one,
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.160]   I'm getting schedules. And now down here's Gmail results. And I only get three. If I do the same
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:12.640]   search on the same search for Australia on Gmail, I get it far more results. So it's not the same
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:20.480]   results. That's one problem, right? Yeah, the field trial is definitely understated. It's a small
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.640]   module that's not mine was collapsed by default. By default, it is I opened it up. Yeah. Yeah. And
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.800]   it does seem it doesn't does seem to be quite all the search results you would get if you went into
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.760]   your Gmail and search. It looks like maybe it's the first three or something. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:43.520]   No, it's not. It seems kind of random. Actually searching. Yeah, let's see.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:50.160]   Yeah, I search for life hacker and I have one, two, three, four, five, I have five results, including.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.920]   Yeah, this is this is kind of random. It's just like a sample. Well, here's some of the email
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.800]   messages saying life hacker that you might have. And I do think that this is going to be a problem
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:06.000]   that Google and remember, this was Marissa Myers fight to keep the Google search page simple. I
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.960]   guess the results page has been getting more and more Baroque all the time. But now it's like,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:17.920]   whoa, there's a I'm seeing the Google bar. I'm seeing G Google plus notifications.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:24.960]   I'm seeing knowledge graph. I mean, this is just huge. It was one more thing.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.760]   Yeah. And I hate to bring this up one more time.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:33.040]   This is the hyper personal news stream with Mr. Marissa Myers vision that you bring together
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.520]   all these flows of information and Google adds value to them because of what it can get to
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:43.920]   know about you. No, this is that. Yeah. It's got my location in here. So, you know,
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.000]   I get, you know, and I like the knowledge graph. The fact that I could see
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   if I'm searching for Australia and the Olympics are going on, it seems likely I might want to
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.280]   see what Australia's metal county is when their next events would be. That's cool.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.600]   I guess that's useful. You just have to look around on the page. The results are way down on
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.800]   that lower right. Well, in this event that was held with search is that they say that the future of
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.160]   search, and I've always said this to you, they want to intuit your intent. It's not about you
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.720]   having to manually search. It's about feeding you information because it knows more about you.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:21.440]   You know, I don't mind how I mean, is it a surprise to people that Google has all the contents of
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.360]   your emails? I don't, we know that already. Isn't that wasn't that common knowledge?
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.120]   We should. And if it's not common knowledge, it's only going to become common knowledge. You
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.160]   know, if you see it near search results. Is that what people are concerned about?
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:40.000]   It seemed like the reaction was that it's a bad user experience to mix private information with
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.680]   public information that if you're searching the web, it's like going to the library versus
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.560]   maybe it reminds them of buzz. Maybe.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:53.280]   It's not leaking any information. No, that's the thing. It's not mixing it in there. It's just
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.800]   presenting it. Yeah, a friend of mine, the first response was, oh, what could go wrong?
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.880]   I think it's this idea that there that there is a possibility that it would somehow leak or
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.560]   release private information. You can it's HTML.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:14.960]   Now I'm doing something Gmail Australia. Somebody suggests in that what you get then is the Gmail
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:22.480]   results at the top. Oh, interesting. So Gmail is like, oh, that's like a keyword that says this,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.520]   I'm looking in my Gmail. Well, but I then I'm getting some Gmail results in my Australia.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:33.120]   You got Gmail results in my Australia search. You got Australia and my Gmail search.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.760]   See, it's still over to the right for me. Oh, is it? So they're obviously still, you know,
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.560]   tweaking and experimenting on us. Yeah. And you imagine too that it can give you your calendar,
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.320]   it can give you things from books you've read, it can give you what else could give you.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.040]   Yeah. I think as long as it's an on off switch that you can disable, why wouldn't why would you mind?
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   I understand some people think, oh, personal results should not show up in in internet search.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:03.520]   I do get that. Yeah, I think that's the objection. I mean, do we all have sort of this, an idea that
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.240]   kind of Google has sort of pushed this idea of like this like purity of search results, you know,
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.320]   that they should be objective, that they should be public, that they should be crack, you know what
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   I mean? That's in the rear view mirror. That's been for ages. Yeah. Yeah. And I was, you know,
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.240]   what you're you're right, I was one of those people was going, no, keep it pure. I maybe I've
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:31.040]   given up now. Yeah, social search is here to stay kind of personal personal news stream like like
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:37.760]   Jeff was saying interesting, or Yahoo. So that's one new Google feature.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:45.840]   Other Google, there's a lot of Google news. You're right. Other Google news, they say now they're
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:52.160]   going to put voice based answers in Google search on the iPad and the iPhone. I hope they do
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:58.720]   this in Android, but it's kind of Google now creeping into the iOS devices.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:07.120]   And there some have said this is where this is where Google clobbers Siri. I don't think so because
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.080]   Siri is still like the you know, you don't have to go anywhere to do Siri, just press the button.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.560]   But are they saying it's kind of the quality of it? Yes, because Siri doesn't, you know,
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.040]   is searching Wolfram alpha and stuff and Google's going to give you much better results.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:28.000]   It's a Google now style contextual search. Right. It doesn't have the cards interface that Google
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.400]   now has, but it does look like it's it's kind of a competitor to Siri. But you're right, you know,
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.680]   Siri has that that native, you know, you double press the home button and it's got the commercials
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:44.880]   and ZOE edition now. But Google probably, I don't know, probably would just return better results.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.760]   Yeah. I never get any cards worth a darn. I get the weather. My appointment says it.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.640]   Oh, you got to do a few searches for your favorite sports teams. And then you'll get,
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.720]   I kind of like that. I'm getting sports scores now. First, it was doing the Minnesota Twins.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:06.400]   I got to stop searching for twins online. But then I'm joking. I don't know why it thinks I
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.440]   wanted another Minnesota Twins. But so what I did is I just did a couple of prophylactic searches
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:17.280]   for the Giants and that fixed it. So I don't know why it thinks I might want to go to the Nike
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:24.400]   factories. Oh, I know why. Oh my God. Okay. That's a little creepy. Okay. I just bought a fuel band
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:33.040]   this morning. Oh, and there must be in my Gmail and a, yeah, an email from Nike because the top
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:42.160]   card is how far it is to the Nike factory store. Yeah, that's a clay Johnson. My former co-worker
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.640]   said that bus tie that he was at a bus stop and bus times loaded. Yeah. Just just kind of when
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.560]   you're near the stop and that directions magically appear when you need them. I haven't had that
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.960]   experience. I mean, I think if you have the Nexus 7, you know, without data, you know, if you're just
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:00.160]   on Wi-Fi, you're less likely to have that happen. But I expect that with Google Glass and with the
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.880]   Galaxy Nexus, which I've activated and I'm going to carry around with me a lot more of that. It's
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.680]   way more Google now is way more useful when you have a data plan and you're not Wi-Fi only and
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.080]   you're moving around the world. Of course it is. And I love, and I have to say I'm loving Google now.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:20.160]   I can't wait to get a jelly bean phone. So here's the giant score and then there's recaps and
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.040]   highlights and box scores. So I could click those. Here's weather. Here's my next calendar
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.520]   appointment. You don't get that, Jeff? I get the calendar. That's it. That's all I got.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:35.040]   Just the calendar. And I could show more cards and it shows nearby businesses, including ours
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.560]   from Google Places. And these are, it's kind of a nice interface. I love this.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.600]   It's a really nice interface. Yeah. I think this, you're right. I can't wait to, now are using it on
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.640]   your Nexus phone. Do you see more stuff because of that, Gina?
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:53.120]   Excuse me. I just activated the Galaxy Nexus. So I haven't taken it out about just yet, but I'm
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.960]   hoping to see more of that. And then there's settings. So on the commute or whatever that is,
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.200]   I can say card appears before commute from home, before commute to home, before other
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.360]   commutes after searching Google Airport Hotel of traveling, other places of traveling. These are
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:13.760]   settings. So I can, I can check these boxes. Where do you get that size? This isn't so, so you
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.320]   promise you got to get a card first. But once you get a car, by the way, there's my searches for
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.520]   Australia and TunnelBear. Once you get a card, there's, there's the dot dot dot now. I, by the
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:31.680]   way, am starting to understand the jelly bean menu metaphor. Because now, not just up here,
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:37.280]   but I can have a dot dot dot on a card, which tells me, oh, you've got a menu on the card
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.360]   specific menu. Oh, are we? Yeah, I'm starting to get it. I'm starting to get it. Same thing with
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.480]   sports. I can customize my sports results before game, during game after game edit teams. So I
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:54.480]   could have just done that game details low priority. So, so this, and you could turn it off. So
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.720]   Jeff, go into your, go into your Google now and play with it a little bit because you can get a lot
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:04.800]   more. Like, that's like, okay. Well, you have to launch the app, right? To see these things.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.920]   Show more cards. So the way you get it is you tap the search bar. So on the Nexus 7,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.760]   this is another thing, by the way, I complained about with ice cream sandwich is the wasted real
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.520]   estate with this forced Google search widget. Well, now makes a little more sense. You tap it. It's,
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.480]   it's not notifications. It's right below notifications. And now that then you get the card, the Google
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.760]   now cards. Oh, that's cool. You don't have that. You can launch it from the lock screen as well.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:37.040]   Yeah, I use a password lock in. Oh, right. You have. So I don't get, I don't get any of that.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.200]   See, that's too bad because if you want a secure device, you lose all of the cool
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.040]   lock screen features. Unless you use a third party app, of course. Whoa, it gives your, your age.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.960]   Wait a minute. You searched for me. Yeah. Leo LePort.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.280]   Well, my age is your birth date and age there. Oh, now it's getting from Wikipedia.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.920]   Yeah. I mean, that's knowledge. Okay. All right. All right. Apparently, it just took too much of
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:12.160]   that. Let me do that again. Now I got Le Week LeMir. Leo LePort. Okay. Now we're going to see. So,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.760]   yeah, actually, this is probably a good thing to do. Yeah, this is normal thing.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.560]   And then there's all this stuff. Unfortunately. Yeah, I'm sure that that's just we could be.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.960]   No, no, no, this is Google. I think this is my Google profile. That was your profile, gotcha.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.520]   So I control this. By the way, and we'll talk about it. In fact, we can talk about it after the
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:36.480]   break, you might want to consider what you put online. Matt Honan wishes he didn't have so much
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:44.320]   online and we're so discoverable. The latest nasty hack has nothing to do with how many bits of
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.600]   encryption you use, how secure your passwords are. We'll talk about that and more just a bit
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.920]   Gina Trepani is here. Jeff Jarvis is going to play with his Google now for a little while.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.960]   I hear, by the way, the Galaxy S3 Samsung has announced we are ready to ship jelly bean.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:05.040]   Sweet. So I have, I probably will get one of the first ones because I have an unlocked.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.360]   I don't have a carrier. I'll probably push down pretty quick. They say they're waiting approval
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.520]   from Google and they've got the code and they're going to push it out soon. Right on. Yeah.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.040]   Everybody needs to get on the bean. It is better. In fact, I was talking to Jason Howell,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.560]   who's the host of our Android show all about Android. He had just reviewed the Asus Prime
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.000]   transformer infinity, which is the latest version of their docking Android tablet
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.800]   with keyboard and it's still shipping on ICS and he had moved from his Nexus 7 with jelly bean.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.120]   He says, there's a big difference. Jelly bean really does make things a lot faster. It's hard
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.400]   to go back. I'm loving mine. I, you know, I honest to God, I'm getting trouble. Oh, I will
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.440]   later the show. I've gotten trouble to have all fanboys and I'm going to do it again.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:56.320]   For a second, my Nexus 7, I honestly have not picked up my iPad once. I know. I haven't either.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.000]   I know. I've done it. It's just the right size. I'm shocking myself.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.920]   He by the way, loved the infinity, the transformer, Asus transform.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:12.240]   For your ability loved it. And I do too. It is what a beautiful display. You get a keep. I mean,
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.760]   I, this is, there are some great Android products now. I think Apple's going to have a little trouble
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.640]   come September when the iPhone new iPhone comes out. Yeah, I think jelly bean was really,
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.800]   they turned a corner. It was a minor release. It was, they turned a corner. It was like,
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.840]   this is what Android always could be. This is what we always wanted it to be.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.760]   It really felt like, okay, I feel good about recommending people like, oh, you know, get,
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.840]   I mean, the devices that it's available on are very limited. But I feel just really good
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.320]   about Android now. I feel like it really reached a solid place.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.040]   Remember that when the new iPhone comes out late September, I would guess that all the new,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.520]   by then all the new Android phones will be coming with jelly bean. For instance, the Galaxy
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.520]   Note 2, actually there's some concern that's going to be launched. Samsung has said the Galaxy
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:08.080]   Note 2 providing the quartz allow us will be launched on August 29th. However, there's apparently
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.760]   some rumor that despite the fact that it's got a quad-quirx in those processor 4G LTE
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:20.480]   improved cameras, it might be ice cream sandwich. That can't be possibly true.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.280]   Anyway, that one, that one's going to have a new screen according to the rumors
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:30.800]   that is a special kind of, it's virtually a flexible machine, a screen.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.520]   Really? And which means it's very thin so you can get more battery in there.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:43.040]   The benchmarks were inadvertently leaked and very impressive.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:49.760]   It's much bigger than the original Galaxy Note. It's like five and a half inches now.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:57.200]   So it's almost getting to be seven sides. So let's call it even six, okay?
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:05.120]   I'm very intrigued. I think that's going to be my next phone. But now I'm putting really
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:10.240]   in a tough position and I think a lot of people will be. iPhone 5, which we'll see,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.280]   is it, are there any major improvements and advances? We've seen iOS 6, so we know what some
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.080]   of what's in there. But a new connector, so I've got to go out and get all new stuff. Or maybe
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:26.480]   I'm going to get an unbreakable Galaxy Note that is five and a half inches.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:32.320]   That may be my phone for... Are you going to drop your Nexus 7 when you have that on
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.920]   Jolie Bean? That's an interesting question, isn't it? That's the real question to me.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:44.160]   I loved my note. I love the S3 even more. I'm such a whore. Never count on Apple though.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:50.400]   You're right. There's going to be something awesome with the iPhone. You know there will be.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.720]   You know, you know I'm going to buy both, so it doesn't really.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.200]   Right. That's my job. And please, folks, it's my job. I do it so you don't have to.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:08.720]   Long ago I chose this path. I'm like a monk. I gave up. I gave up the security, the safety of
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.440]   having one phone for two years for the very rough and tumble life of a new phone every few months.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:20.720]   Believe me, folks, it is a path only a few should walk. I did this for you.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.280]   I'll try this at home, kids. I got it and have to get the funny haircut. That's all I'm saying.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.960]   All right. We're going to take a break. Come back with more Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:35.360]   Leo Laport. This is Twig this week in Google brought to you today by Stamps.com. There's something
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.800]   I'm not giving up. I will not. I will walk the monastic life, but I will not. You can get my
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.920]   stamp scale out of my hands when you prior to my gold dead figures. Stamps.com lets you print
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:51.120]   US postage. Sorry. I get emails all the time from Brits saying, well, we may have the Olympics,
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:58.320]   but you've got stamps.com. Let's you print US postage from your computer and your printer.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.840]   You don't need special ink. You don't need a postage meter. How is Pitney Bow still in business?
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.760]   I don't understand. This is so cool. You print out and I'm going to show you how you get the USB
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.080]   scale. So you plop the letter or the package or whatever on there. You print exactly the postage
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.880]   you need at one penny more, not one penny less governor and you put it right on there.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.040]   And then the mail carrier comes, they get it. So you never have to get up from your desk.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.840]   You never go to the post office again. You can get up from your desk, but you don't have to go
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.080]   to the post office anymore. They do things that are so cool. For instance, you can print right
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.800]   out. I keep thinking I got to we mail these out, you know, and we print right in the envelope.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.040]   You complete your logo on there. I mean, it really looks pro. And stamps.com works with QuickBooks
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:44.640]   and other software to actually get the addresses. So if you're doing invoices or billings or whatever,
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:51.600]   it just it does it all the principle beautifully on the stamp and everything on there. But you
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.920]   can also do things like international mailing, which is always a hassle. You got to go get the
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.160]   forms and do all this. No, stamps.com does it all fill out the forms for you. Even if you're
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.120]   an Amazon or eBay seller, same thing. Fill out the forms from the data on the screen. It's so
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.840]   smart. Now here's what you do. Go to stamps.com and you can try this free for a month. Now,
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.040]   wait a minute. Don't do the $80 value. Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner. It says
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:22.480]   heard about us on a podcast or radio and use our promo code TWIG TWIG, the $80 deal,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:30.640]   $110. You get $55 in free postage coupons. You can't use them all at once, but you can use
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.880]   them over a period of a few months. You get the scale, you pay shipping handling. So I can't
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.480]   technically call this a free offer. It's five bucks shipping in hell, but you can keep the scale,
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.280]   cancel anytime and keep the scale. So it's a good deal. You get $5 with the materials that give
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.000]   you a whole supplies kit and a month of stamps.com with no charge. So it's a good deal.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.160]   $110 offer. Just use our promo code TWIG really great for an eBay or Amazon seller.

[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:17.840]   Google's self-driving cars complete 300,000 miles without an accident. Actually, if you read the blog,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.920]   and maybe I'm reading too much into this, it says something, it says,
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:30.160]   wait a minute, where is it? I got to read this exactly right.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:35.200]   Completing one. This is on TechCrunch. Yeah. Well, yeah, but the Google blog has, the official
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:40.560]   blog has it. Basically, they said 300,000 miles whenever the computer was in charge,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:46.400]   no accident, which implies to me, see, there hasn't been a single accident under computer control.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.280]   Under one vendor earlier on. And it was a human. It was a human.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:59.680]   I just, I know it's parsing the, but there hasn't been a single accident under computer control
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:05.040]   emphasis mine. Well, and now they have one on Mars. That's right. It's not a ton.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.640]   Autonomous isn't sort of autonomous because 14 minutes communication lag, you can't exactly steer it.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:15.760]   So you sit in the driver's seat when you're in one of these cars. Hover your hands.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:23.120]   You hover. No, you don't. You sit back. You smoke a pipe. You read playboy and it takes you to work.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.640]   It's sort of like an airplane pilot. You watch. You watch. You're there. You don't necessarily.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.320]   So what do you think is more audacious? Google Glass or the self-driving car?
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:39.680]   Self-driving car transforms the world. Yes, it does. It does. It changes the view of how we spend our
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.240]   time. It changes the view of, you know, gee, the car can come pick you up and take you somewhere.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   The information that's about that are relations with people while we're in the car. Oh, yeah,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:56.160]   changes so much. And the thing that's interesting safety is huge. And I think that's going to promote
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.320]   this. You know, it's so interesting to watch people's attitudes change because if you
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.800]   asked us three years ago, universally, oh, I'm not going to let car drive. That's scary.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.240]   But now where you know, planes fly themselves. I hate to tell you, but
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.440]   frequently the plane is landing itself. The pilot's sitting there. Maybe he's sitting there like this,
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.480]   but he's he's not doing anything. Right. Unless you're landing a plane in the Hudson,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.240]   which happens once in a human for that. 100 years. Right. So we're not getting rid of drivers.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.440]   We're not getting rid of pilots. But for a routine and I think one of the things that held back
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.000]   autonomous vehicles, the earliest in the way we envisioned it was special roads.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.120]   Yes, exactly. But you don't need that. I was so Google to rethink it entirely.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:47.280]   Yeah. Because it uses LIDAR and images at the road around you. It's on any road. And I think
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:53.200]   what's going to drive this is as the deaths go up from texting while driving. Yeah. Yep.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.160]   There's going to be a human cry. I think people are going to finally say, you know,
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.760]   really good point. This is not safe. I heard something on the radio the other day.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.720]   You know, it's one of those things that's just too glib to be good, but at least it
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.560]   illustrates the problem. Someone arguing that young people were saying that they're not
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:14.000]   distracted driving, that driving distracts them from communicating. Oh, that's a great
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.120]   recontextualization. Hey, I should be texting. I'm texting here. Yeah. Don't ask me to shift.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:25.760]   Right. Steer, I'm texting. I got to get some. The ads and they're very moving. And I think they're
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.040]   running on the Olympics of where the, oh God, the horrible one. Those are a killer.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.400]   Where the sister holds up the word, yeah. And says this,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.280]   their heartbreaker. This was the text I sent my sister that she was reading when she,
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.320]   you know, drove off the cliff and died. And whether that, of course, we have no idea if
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.480]   that she was reading that text, by the way, I just want to point out this illogical fallacy.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.840]   It's true, isn't it? Unless there was a witness.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.120]   Right. But it's a good, it's a good ad.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:02.720]   Yeah, it is. And it, and I do think that you're, that that's going to be one of a lot of factors
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.400]   that are pushing this. And I wouldn't be surprised. This is going to happen faster than we think.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.440]   I've talked to autonomous car specialists, one of the visions that I hadn't really thought about.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.240]   He said, you know, you don't have to own a car anymore. And so Zipcar's moving in this direction,
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.440]   too, right? The car, if they're autonomous, you don't have to own an RV. You don't have to own
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:27.040]   a car. What you do is you say, um, I want to go to the Grand Canyon, pick me up at three car shows up,
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.920]   you get in it, drives you the Grand Canyon. Oh, by the way, I need an RV. When you get there,
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:37.200]   the RV's there drives you wherever you want to be. When you're done, the RV goes back to the,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.320]   the fleet, the car goes back to the fleet. You didn't own it.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.600]   And, and by the way, you get so many more options. I wrote about this, what will Google do,
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.640]   inspired by a guy named Rashad Tamakawala, who said that if you stop being a manufacturing company,
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.160]   manufacturing cars, and, and you become a, we get you there nicely company, um, you know, so you're
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.760]   going out for a nice date with your wife tonight. Well, we'll send you the Mercedes.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.480]   Oh, I just need to hold my college. We'll send you this. I just want to save some energy. We'll
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.040]   send you the smart. I'm going 10 miles. I'm going 100 miles. You know, you can have all this
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:15.760]   choice that you're not, you're stuck now. And it's hideously wasteful. Oh, we all own vehicles
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:22.320]   that are not being used 90% of the time. It's true. It's a good one. The amount of consumables
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:30.880]   that's con, that's wasted is horrendous. Yes. So, so the, the world is moving in this direction.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:37.200]   I have no doubt about this thing. I bet when Google did take the car to Detroit, remember,
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.960]   we did that story one four months ago or something. You've got to imagine that the, the argument
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.440]   isn't just, oh, it's another feature for the car. The argument's got to be, have you seen what
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.840]   happened to the music industry? Have you seen what happened to the newspaper and book industries?
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:58.560]   You guys are in their path here and you've got to change your essential model. And can you do that?
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.680]   Have we been trying to get Sebastian's run on the, on the show, a chat on this show? Well,
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.240]   our triangulation. He's the guy in charge of this project. He's also, I met him. I met him in
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.080]   Munich at the DLD conference. You share a car, I get in the car and I say, hi, how are you?
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.000]   Hi, how are you? I'm Sebastian. I'm Jeff. What do you do? I'm a Google. What do you do there?
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.520]   I created the operating system for the, for the car. And then he has private audiences. Yeah.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.520]   And I, I just taught this course at quit Stanford because I got 160,000 people. I'm under that now.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.760]   Yeah. He's doing, is it Udacity? Which ones are he doing?
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:34.480]   Yes. Yeah. This guy is perhaps one of the most interesting people in the world. I really want to,
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:40.640]   because these people who are hitting in Google, I put something up on the, on the, on the list today
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:46.560]   about two, it was a wired feature about, oh, if Xerox Parker invented the PC,
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:51.040]   Google's inventing the net and attribute to two other geeks in Google, you just go into these
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.400]   companies. They're these, these, well, Peter, no, Norfolk, Peter, Norfolk is like Einstein.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:03.040]   The guy doing Google speeches, I think his name is Mike Cohen. These, you're right. It's full of
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.520]   people like that. Yeah. One story up here too is, is that when you talk to your Android,
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.840]   you're talking to a neural network. Yeah. That's just beyond anything that we would have thought
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:17.520]   of only a few years ago. Right. The future's happening. It's just maybe hidden inside Google.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:24.800]   So the problem is Google owns the future. Yeah. Well, maybe we'll just have to get over that.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.760]   I, you know, I do notice when we, I talked to Ford all the time because they're sponsoring
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.960]   it happen for a few years. I love my Mustang drive it all the time. And I, I, when I first started
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.600]   talking to the CEO of Ford and asked, because I always ask about autonomous vehicles every
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.680]   single time. He was like, no, no, people like to drive. We're, we're not thinking about that.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:52.640]   Two years, three years later. Yeah. Yeah. We're thinking about that. Yeah. Yeah. We got,
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.760]   what they're doing is if you think about the new Ford vehicles as many manufacturers
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:03.840]   have automatic lane detection, they have, I mean, there's all sorts of automatic stuff,
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:09.520]   automatic parking. I mean, they're slowly incrementally putting this stuff in the cars.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:14.400]   And people who like to drive will be people like people who like to ride horses. They can do so.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.320]   You know, if they want. So one of the chat rooms said that, Oh, great. You know,
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.080]   this means that a 19 year old in Bangladesh could kill people. You know, these, these cars
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.560]   will be hackable. And, but that's, that's not a reason not to do something. That's like saying,
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.920]   you know, we shouldn't build houses because the ceiling could fall in. Like, of course,
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.960]   this is going to present new problems, problems that we're not anticipating. But it seems pretty
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:40.960]   obvious that the benefit will outweigh the risks. Thank you. Thank you for saying that. Because I
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   think that that is true that we do. I mean, if you read demon, or you read this new book about,
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:52.880]   which is about predator drones, kill decision, it's scary. The idea of them being hacked is scary,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.440]   but, and we know hacking happens. We're going to talk about it. But,
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:03.760]   that's not the reason to stop the future. Absolutely. And you know, and this, you know, when you
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.320]   compare this to glass, like the safety angle, you know, how many this will save this many lives
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:13.440]   per year, right? With class, it's like, why people will say, why do I want this? Why do I need this?
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.600]   You know, the automated that the self driving car, it's a lot more. I don't think glass is
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:23.440]   going to save any lives. I come to the guests. No, but, but you know, just one of the other
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:30.000]   stories in the rundown is how, because of the huge proliferation of Android devices,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.960]   that has now led Google to be able to have live traffic data in other 30 cities in America.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:41.600]   Because just tracking, oh, we know that device is on I-78 and we know it just stopped along with 10
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.560]   others. So we know the traffic's jammed there, right? That kind of emergent data that comes from
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:52.400]   us all being connected and doing things has a benefit that we kind of can't yet guess.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:59.600]   Yeah. Google kills Google. Listen, I got an email from Rob Walsh at Libson. He said,
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:08.800]   hallelujah. Finally, because there are good third party podcast apps. Listen was always a little
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.760]   funky. Little wonky. What do what do what do what client do you guys like the best? I get this
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:20.000]   question all the time. I love downcast. That's one of there's there's several. I actually asked
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.240]   this question on Twitter and downcast, I think was one. Dogcatcher. Dogcatcher. I mean,
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:32.880]   now downcast is for iOS. Dogcatcher is the one I like. Yep. And Instacast. Instacast. Yes. Those
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:39.680]   are the two. The nice thing about dogcatcher is it does audio and video. Yeah. And it does
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.880]   it very well. It's, you know, it's just, I think it's just really sweet. I have feeds that I subscribe
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:52.240]   to automatically updates. It's got all the features you'd want, I think. Speaks, speed variation.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:58.560]   Still waiting for the Kindle of podcatcher apps. You know, the one that he saves where you've
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.440]   paused what you've listened to, what you haven't listened to across devices. That's still, you know,
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:13.520]   not pocket casts. That's another one people like. I think, I'm not, see, I have an opinion about
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:20.080]   podcasts in general. Okay. They're fine. They're good. Nothing wrong with them.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:26.720]   Yeah. I think podcasts are okay. They're okay. Yeah. Beyond pod. There's another one.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.520]   But, but I also noticed that we and I would imagine a lot of companies are going to end up
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:37.920]   doing our own apps. Did you, did you catch the line on the newsroom last week in the previous?
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.120]   You're one scrip away from having your own podcast. That was great. I know I laughed. I
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:49.200]   loved it. I'm starting to like newsroom a little better. I don't know. The 911 episode must have
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:55.920]   moved both of you guys quite a bit. No, no, it got me. I thought it was got me. I thought it was
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:03.200]   just overdone. That's typical. It was a little sentimental. It was overdone, but it got me a lot.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:09.280]   So it's the new, the conceit of newsroom, which is there in circa and show on HBO, which we have
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.520]   talked about before, is that it's covering old news events. So you can kind of see what happened
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.800]   behind the scenes. And of course, none of it has any relation to what actually happens in
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.200]   newsrooms anywhere. That's part of the reason Jeff hates it because he's actually been in a newsroom.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:27.600]   But this one was the, so I've been lauding killing. And I thought they milked the hell out.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:33.040]   They did. The scene on the plane. It was so overwrought. But I'll admit that I was.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:38.960]   It got me though. I couldn't, couldn't resist when the guy stands up in the control room
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.120]   and puts on his NY FD hat.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.800]   Oh, FDNY.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.840]   FDNY. I cried.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:44.880]   It was small.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.600]   See, but that, but it worked. It cried.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:53.040]   I was boo-hooing by the end of it. And I hate that I was, but I was.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.120]   I didn't mean to derail the conversation about podcast apps. Sorry.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.960]   It was a good, that was a good line. But but sort can always does this, by the way,
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.280]   sort can always sneaks in technology references that are basically snarky. Always.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:10.720]   I have a blog. Lolly Pop, Lolly Pop and Surrender Dorothy.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.120]   It's all, it's all.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.920]   So you think every podcast network or podcast or we'll have their own.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:23.040]   No, no, but, but, and so this is an interesting argument because we talk about open web versus
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:28.560]   apps all the time, right? But is there an open web role for podcasts? I don't think so.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.080]   iTunes dominates 99%.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.760]   Right. Yeah. And
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.760]   and Williams tried ODO years ago, right?
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.000]   Yeah. And gave up when Apple did iTunes.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.200]   Yep. Yep.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:46.160]   So you just have all these disconnected feeds with these big files hosted across web servers.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.120]   But I'm, I still want that Kindle experience of like.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:54.000]   I agree. It is RSS. I mean, the good news is it's all standard space. They're, they're the
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.480]   formats are standards based. The RSS for the feeds is standards based. So it is really open web.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.720]   And I hate the idea of an app, but for instance, how does live fit into that? And live is a very
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.040]   much a part of what we do. Oh, right. Now that that's a good point. Right.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.640]   Is that it? Or is your app?
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.360]   Notifications.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:19.600]   Yeah. So we do, so we do apps because we want to have live and chat in addition to download.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.160]   And then you want show notes and yeah, I mean, you want the enhanced, the enhanced
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.520]   experience.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.200]   So I don't know. I feel guilty doing an app, but at the same time it really does.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:36.240]   It also, and I have to admit this, and this is why companies that can afford it will do it.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.600]   It builds in audience because you have space on the desktop as opposed to being buried inside
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.360]   dogcatcher. Right.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:49.360]   It's harder for you to get discovery with it, but it's a better relationship if you have
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.400]   been discovered.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:55.040]   And with our audience, they're smart and they can find it and download it. And then it's,
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.120]   then it's a button. And we have, you know, we don't even do our own apps. We're starting to look at
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:03.040]   that, but we have great people doing great, really good apps. And the fact that, see, I don't think
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:09.360]   of our shows as podcasts. I think I'm as on demand versions of the show, right? So,
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:15.520]   that's, that's kind of a conceit, but I, but I think that we're alive network, right?
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.720]   Yep.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.000]   And I think that this kind of a device I'm looking at a Nexus 7 with,
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.680]   with tape, you're on NBC. This is recursive going on. Yeah. Well, wait a little,
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.720]   wait a little. It actually shows the screen. No, now we're going to problem.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:34.240]   So this kind of app though makes us very appealing. And that was instant. I didn't have to download
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:39.760]   anything. It's just, it's like turning on TV. This is too much fun. Oh my God. I got a screen
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:46.160]   cap. This is audio old fashioned podcast. We're seeing Leo watch Leo watch Leo. Yeah.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:51.200]   For those of you still listening on audio. So, but we're looking at Nexus 7. I mean,
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   this, that's why one of the exciting things about Nexus 7, it's a great media device, right?
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:00.400]   As will be a seven inch iPad and perhaps a five and a half inch Galaxy note.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.600]   But the one thing I wish it had was a back facing camera. Because I, I agree,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.600]   boards all the time. I agree. It seems an odd thing to leave out.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.920]   This boy, if they put a great camera in here, like a really good camera in here,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:18.080]   this would be really. Yeah. You really missed the back facing. I have been watching people in the
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:23.840]   audience in the Olympics holding up their big iPads, like recording stuff and it just looks crazy.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:28.160]   And I don't know. I always kind of feel like, why, you know, why wouldn't you use your phone or a
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.920]   small camera? I just looked crazy. Greg, Greg Louganis had this like crazy Ed Hardy iPad cover
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:39.120]   was holding it up. I was like, what is that? It's like, Oh, that's his iPad. Yeah, I'm going to
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   pry this open. I don't know. I've never done this before. Oh, oh, but I'm going to. Oh, dear. Oh,
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.440]   hi. That's can't. This can't go well. Oh, yes. You didn't know that, did you? But
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:55.920]   Robert Balaser, the priest told me that you can do that on this and watch what happens when you
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.800]   go. He knows Leo's snapping open his. Oh, look at how beautiful. See what that is. That's a hole
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   for a camera. Oh, oh, so we could pretty much then, by the way, this is a 3G
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:15.280]   antenna that's not used. So we're free forg. So we pretty much know that the next generation will
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:22.000]   have a camera in the back and a 4G radio. Well, I think what's brilliant here is it's they sold
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.200]   the low end version first to get used to it and then they'll pump up. Yeah, but I'd pay 350 for a
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.840]   camera. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm addicted to this. I'll buy the upgrade of this thing. Sure.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:37.520]   This is a this but this is so much more than a hit. This is a Trojan horse. This is Google. And
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.600]   just as you were saying, Gina, everybody's starting to say, Oh, jelly means not so bad.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:47.440]   Oh, this is a pretty good form factor. I would be anything you miss from your iPad or iPhone.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   Well, the one thing I guess is I can't get HBO and Showtime to go on the Nexus.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:58.560]   And an airplane and stuff like that. But mostly I miss the ecosystem. And I think that's really
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:06.560]   where Apple has the lock in is this kind of all in one Apple TV iTunes ecosystem.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.080]   But I think in so many ways, jelly bean is way ahead of iOS.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:17.280]   Yeah, I mean, I never had an Apple TV. So I never when I stopped buying stuff from my
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.360]   tunes a long time ago. So I don't I don't miss that so much. There are a couple of apps I miss.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:26.000]   I miss like note see, which is a great Dropbox enabled notes app that I use in the iPad,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.320]   a couple of apps here and there. But for the most part, I really haven't missed it.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.920]   That's getting rare and rare. You know, what's Flipboard was on the Android.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.000]   That was a big one. Instagram Instagram.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.960]   By the way, doesn't Marco say he makes more money on Insta paper for Android? He's like 600%
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:50.000]   up 600%. I'm like that. Did he say that? I would be shocked if he said that because he's
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:56.160]   I know he likes. He loves iOS. I was a couple of weeks ago. Let me see if I can find the story.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.800]   He was shocked.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.800]   Came out July 4th. I can't find the story.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:13.760]   I'll look and we can. Yeah, see if we find it. All right. Gosh, you know, we only have about an
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:22.160]   hour and a half, three hours, maybe left. So let's. Let's move through a few stories here. Google
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:27.600]   Arthur's Guild seeks two billion dollars from Google for book scanning.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:34.240]   Even more than the music people wanted out of. Please. You know, one of the stories that came out,
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:40.400]   it was part of Google's argument to drop the case, to dismiss the case that I quite liked,
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:46.560]   was that just as one example, by having the books digitized, it was possible to look back at mad
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:52.640]   men and find out what was an anachronistic language and not. By not having that knowledge
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:59.680]   put together in a place where you could you could analyze it. We lose. Yep. Speaking of being a
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.960]   steward, publishers and libraries are stewards of information for God's sakes and they're not
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:12.240]   like it. Don't and don't get me started on the academic journal scam. Yep. That's a really obscene
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:19.360]   scam perpetrated by some of the same fine publishers. Here it is. Insta paper for Andrai. Thank you,
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:24.000]   Chatham. Seizes 600% jump and downloads on a release of Nexus 7. So it's not quite what I was
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.400]   saying. It's the Android sales jump 600% when the Nexus 7 got released. Okay, that makes complete
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:37.600]   sense. Yeah. There you go. Thanks, Chatham. Active device installs.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:47.280]   These are for Android. Anyway, Nexus 7, it's showing what it's showing is not what I was
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:52.000]   submitting, which it's not better than iOS, but it is showing that Nexus 7 has kind of transformed
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.960]   the market. Google invest in digital signature company docuSign.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:05.600]   Another kick to the kidneys of the US Postal Service. Oh dear. Why do you have to mail things?
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.800]   Right. If you have electronic signatures. Yeah. And so now if you can do that,
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:16.160]   you can do legal documents a lot faster. You can store them. You can transfer them. You can do
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.920]   all kinds of things. Right. So we should expect to see this in Google Docs.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:28.560]   Yeah. Oh, how interesting. Yeah. Google Docs becomes real ready for prime time and for businesses
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:34.560]   then, doesn't it? This is a really key kind of functionality that's been missing. I mean,
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:40.400]   people are still faxing real estate documents because of the signature. You're right. Actually,
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:44.640]   the first thing that I hope this kills is the damn fax machine. God, yes. Seriously.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.440]   Oh, I save the postal service, but kill the fax machine.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.640]   I don't know if it's a postal service, but we're going to change all the drivers to
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.600]   self driving cars. And then we'll say the fortune there. I look forward to seeing this.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:05.520]   Google and Oracle have been ordered to disclose which bloggers and journalists they paid to influence
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:11.600]   coverage. Wait a second. They're paying bloggers to cover. Where's someone? Where's my money?
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:16.480]   Where's my this is a court order from judge William Alsop who demanded both companies reveal which
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.560]   bloggers and journalists they have compensated. He's concerned that evidence presented over the
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:27.280]   course of the case may have included commentary from paid bloggers or journalists most notably
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:35.280]   among this group, Florian Mueller of false patents. We quote him all the time. He is paid by both
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:42.000]   Oracle and Microsoft. But we knew this, by the way, and this gets down to that thing of just as
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.440]   long as you disclose. Is it okay to talk about? I mean, you know, Google says we will comply.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:54.800]   Oracle says it's all Google's fault. Oracle has always disclosed all of its financial
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:01.040]   relationships in this matter. It's time for Google to do the same. We read this order to also include
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:07.600]   indirect payments to entities who in turn made comments on behalf of Google. This is going to be
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:12.080]   interesting. I'd be a little more nervous if I were getting money from Google or Oracle than I
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:18.160]   know. Unfortunately, none of this. You guys, I'm sure you're all right too. No, I did not.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:23.520]   But what if I bought this t-shirt with my own money? Yeah, exactly. Well, what if Google had
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.320]   purchased ads non-twit? Would that count as being paid by them? I don't know. Well, that's,
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.800]   I don't know what the judge thinks. In fact, Google did buy ads on Twit three or four years
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:37.120]   ago. They bought some ads for the summer of code, you know, their internship program,
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.480]   which is a great program. And I was very glad that. But an ad is a disclosure.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:45.760]   Yeah. Right. So is this only undisclosed? Yeah, it is itself a form of a story.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:50.000]   That's obviously paid. We make sure that when you hear an ad, you know that it's a paid commercial.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.280]   Yeah, I was once, I think it was the journal, the Wall Street Journal was doing a story and quoted
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:59.200]   me something about Google. And then their fact checker called me to vet me and said, you know,
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:03.920]   has Google ever paid you? And I was like, well, I got a check for 10 cents from AdSense seven years
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:11.520]   ago. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute. I do. We get Google, we got Google AdSense. I sell an app in the
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:16.240]   play store. So I do get money from Google every month, but that's some sales through there, you know,
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:20.720]   and we did summer of code for think up, which means like I got a stipend from mentoring the
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.640]   coders who are working on, you know, but that's not, that's not considered employment. And they
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:28.720]   questioned me about it quite a bit. They didn't quite understand. And like, that's so it's, you know,
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:35.920]   it's a it's a blurry line. Yeah, I think if you sold something other than coverage to Google,
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.400]   that's legitimate. Yeah, I'm selling you a product. Right. Since we're all just closing,
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:44.560]   I got paid for expenses for a trip that they want me to do. And so that was all just expenses.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:51.280]   Oh, free admission in Google I/O plus a bunch of crap.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right. Absolutely. Oh crap.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:01.360]   Can you edit this whole thing out, Jen? Just edit that whole. But how much money did we give
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:06.000]   them for the glass? Oh, yeah, I gave him $1,500 for Google. So we kind of broke even.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.680]   I never got any crap from, I just want to point out. Kevin Marks got all my crap.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:17.920]   He got the Google Q. He got the Chromebook. He got the Chromebook. He got the, you know, the next
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:29.120]   license. You know, really seriously, if you wanted to be, you know, sticklers about this,
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:34.560]   all that counts as inflows. So this should be very interesting.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:43.120]   Let's talk about Matt Hone and we'll talk about security and I will get schooled
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:51.280]   in Google's two factor authentication, which I think is crap. But perhaps I'm wrong and I'm open,
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:57.440]   I'm open-minded to all of that. I did not get a Google TV. I did not get anything. Kevin Marks got
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:04.240]   all my crap. I got to say, I bought my Google TV. I bought my Nexus 7. This is a purchased Nexus 7.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.040]   You know why? You could tell because it's got a dark back. Not the special Google,
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:16.160]   Google-y back. But see, I've been doing this a long time. I buy everything I can. We occasionally
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:22.880]   would get stuff for review before you buy our review show, but I buy stuff. I'm going to review
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:28.480]   on the Gizwiz. I have a new segment on the Gizwiz called Stuff, Crap I Found on Sky Mall.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:34.240]   The first thing I'm going to review is something called Orbital Skates.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:44.240]   I actually paid $159 to break my ass. So I think I'm okay. Didn't get them free from the Orbital
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:50.240]   Skate Company or Sky Mall. Otherwise, could I say crap? I just give you a break there after that.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:57.840]   I pay for my own. There it is. I'm going to get those and I'm going to ride them.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.680]   And I'm going to break my... Oh, I even get the first six inches. You know what I'm... Now I'm
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.720]   investigating. Actually, it's not the cost of the skates it wears me. It's the cost of the
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:14.400]   padding that I have to buy before I even try those skates. I want to get one of those. You know,
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.520]   they have the fake sumo wrestler, inflatable suits. That's what I'm going to get. Because
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.600]   Zenna, you fall. It doesn't matter. You look like a little roly-poly doll. Are you going to livestream
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:30.960]   this? Yes. We got to see that. Yes. Well, it was that or strapping mattresses to my front and back.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.400]   And I thought it'd be better to bread the soup than strap the mattresses.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:45.360]   This show brought to you by Ting. Ting. You know about Ting? Ting is so cool. Twig
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:51.280]   and Ting. Like this, they go hand in hand. Go to ting.com/twig. T-I-N-G. It is the
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:58.080]   new cell phone service brought to you from Tukaz. The same people that do hover.com.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:04.080]   With the same idea, they wanted to reinvent cell phone service. They know these other companies are
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.240]   terrible. So what they decided to do is let's how would you do it? If you're going to do it,
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.880]   right, let's redesign it. So first of all, they're built on the Sprint network. So if Sprint works
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:17.840]   for you wherever you are, this will work exactly the same. Many of the same phones.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:26.640]   But the way Ting works is you pay only for what you use. You never pay a penalty for
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:33.680]   using more than you said you were going to use. And they will refund. If you say, I'm going to use
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:39.360]   more and you don't, they will give you a refund of the stuff that you don't use every month. You
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:45.120]   can get a check from Ting. So let's go to the plans here. These are kind of, you don't really
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:51.040]   have to choose a plan actually. Because you could say, zero, zero, zero, and then you just pay at
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.520]   this rate what you use. But you could also, if you wanted a budget, you could say, well, I'm going
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.440]   to use 2000 minutes. By the way, can you use this across as many phones as you want? So if you have
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.080]   20 phones, you could still, and so great for a family or small business. I'm going to do, let's
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.800]   say 1000 text messages. That's a lot for a month. And I'll use three gigabytes. Okay,
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.120]   that would cost you 106 bucks a month. You want to, oh, you need more phones? Let's add some phones.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.560]   Let's make it five phones, 130 bucks a month for all of that. And if you use less, they refund the
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:25.440]   difference. If you use more, they just charge you at the same rate. That includes, by the way,
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:31.280]   absolutely free voicemail picture and video messaging, three way calling, caller ID, and most importantly,
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:38.480]   free tethering, free hotspot. They're not trying to screw you. That's kind of a novel way to do
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.520]   businesses as a cell phone company. They actually respect their customers. Take a look at the phones.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:50.800]   They've got great phones. And by the way, if you go to ting.com/twig and use their online savings
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:57.840]   calculator, you'll save 50 bucks on the phone. So they're even a better deal. Galaxy S3 just came
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:04.960]   in. Yay. Yay. White or black? Not white or gray. Yeah, I love the S3. This is my favorite phone.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:10.800]   They have 32 gigabyte. And again, if you go to ting.com/twig, you just subtract 50 bucks right off the
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.880]   top. They even have inexpensive feature phones. And, and I like this, mobile hotspots too,
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:23.280]   at the same great pricing. So I want you to try it. Ting.com/twig, those folks at Tukows have really
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.960]   kind of staked a claim for themselves. They want to be the company that helps geeks, that takes
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:34.960]   businesses that just don't make sense like domain registration or cell phone service and do it right.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:44.960]   What a novel idea. We should all support him ting.com/twig. No surprises. No surprises.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.160]   I'll tell you who was surprised. Matt Honan on Friday night. Matt wrote for Gizmodo. I've known
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.120]   him for years. He's currently writes for the gadget lab at wired.com. He's a really nice guy
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:02.640]   with an 18 month old baby. Very sweet. He was playing with his baby on Friday night when his
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:08.240]   iPhone went and reset. That's not. So well, I'll just recover it. I'll restore it. Then his
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:13.600]   iPad did the same thing. Then his MacBook Air erased itself. And then that's when he knew something
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:20.000]   was wrong. His Gmail account had been hacked. Turned out the hackers had one simple aim. He has
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.280]   at MAT on Twitter and they liked that. And they said, we want to get, we want to own his Twitter
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:32.560]   account. All of this was done to own his Twitter account. We now know that the technique was very
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:39.440]   interesting, did not involve hacking, cracking, root forcing. It was all social engineering.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.320]   They started off going on the net to find what they were looking for. Matt's mailing address and
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:50.720]   email address. They found that with a who is search for his personal website. He wasn't using
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:56.000]   who is privacy. And so they got that. Then they call up Amazon. Now this whole has been since plugged
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.720]   by Amazon because of the attention that Matt got. They called up Amazon, said, I want to add an
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.600]   email address to my existing account. Amazon says, fine, what's your mailing address? What's
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:12.080]   your email address? Okay, here's the new address. They got their own email address attached to the
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:16.720]   Amazon account. More importantly, they got the last four digits. Oh, I think they said they,
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.280]   I can't remember the D that they want to add a credit card. They got the last credit card.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.520]   They got the last four digits of the old credit card. And that's the key because it turns out,
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:31.600]   if you then call Apple and you say, Hey, I forgot my iCloud password. Can I reset it? They say,
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.800]   Oh, yeah, sure. Here's the security. Oh, I don't remember the security questions either.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:39.680]   Okay. What's your, what's your address associated with the account? Your mail and mailing address,
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.440]   your email and the last four digits of the credit card associated with the account.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:49.280]   They have that from Amazon. They gave it to them. Apple let them reset the iCloud account. They
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:56.080]   get into the iCloud account. Turns out he's got his Gmail account password change. Email is his
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:01.280]   iCloud account. So they go to Gmail, they say, I want to change the password. Password gets sent
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:08.160]   to the iCloud account, which they've got into. Now they got his Gmail. They got his, they got his
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.760]   iCloud and they used that to get Twitter as well and started posting homophobic and racist tweets.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:18.480]   Yeah, this is basically that the nightmare. This is the cloud nightmare.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:25.360]   He was pwned big time. By the way, I talked about it last night, the good news, and I think
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:32.160]   it's okay to say this. The good news is that Apple took the laptop to some forensics. They had not,
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.000]   the wipe had not completed. They didn't get to the overwrite because there was an overwrite stage.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:40.400]   So Apple was brute forced to the pin and was able to give it back to him unlocked.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.920]   He is going to, I set him up with DriveSavers and he's going to take it up there. And I think
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.760]   he's going to get all his pictures back because he didn't have a backup.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.960]   That's great. That was the real tragedy. Forget the homophobia on Twitter. Well,
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   he had lost the pictures of his daughter from her first year of life.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.520]   Yeah, it haven't heard from me yet, but I think he's going to be able to get it back.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.360]   Glad to hear that.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:06.080]   Yes. So, and lesson learned, back up, I think we make it clear that you shouldn't have
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:11.440]   kind of this interlocking emails. You know, you should have, he says, and this is the thing that's
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.360]   interesting. If I had turned on two-factor authentication on my Google account, this wouldn't have happened.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:21.760]   True. Apple has suspended temporarily, at least it's over the phone. Apple ID password resets.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.640]   They won't admit why, but it's obvious why. And Amazon has closed that security hole as well.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:33.200]   But I talked to these hackers last night, by the way, and had a little chat, just not in person,
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:40.160]   just on Twitter. They approached me and I verified it. It was them. And I said, well,
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:45.680]   these holes have been closed. And they said, well, we got lots more. We got lots more.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:51.920]   But they said, I think this is interesting. We decided not to, we feel bad about what happened
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.480]   to Matt. So we decided not to hurt anybody. We're just going to exploit stuff and make some money.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.560]   And then I said, well, you know, you're going to get busted. You got to be really, you know,
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.800]   dude, stop, you're going to get arrested. And they said, oh, no, we're not going to get
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.120]   arrested because we're not hacking anymore. We're just exploiting holes. So.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.760]   Huh?
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:19.920]   I also asked, if you were going to hack me, where would you start? And they said, oh,
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.760]   boy. First thing we do is we go out on the internet and we look for information about you.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:29.040]   Yep. From who is or publicly posted email addresses, that kind of thing.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.760]   And then once we get some information about you, we can then mostly what they're doing is social
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.360]   engineering. I thought it was very interesting. Yeah, you basically, you make a list of common
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.160]   security questions, right? And then you for public personalities, like you leave and like us,
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.920]   you go and try and find, you know, so the Sarah Palin email hack was like, where did you meet your
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.120]   spouse? Was still a high? Like right on our Wikipedia page.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:56.800]   Obvious. So, um, what's the, uh, what's the solution here? Is it?
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.080]   How do you fix this? So, so let's talk about two factor off.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.480]   So I turned it on twice now, my life, turn it back off a month or a day or a week later.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:15.280]   For two reasons. One, it's a big pain in the ass. Now, not for everybody. In fact, I was
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.200]   tweeting back and forth with Matt cuts and he said, well, you know, so here's how it works. If
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.920]   you're on, once you turn it on, uh, when you go to log into your Google account, you use your
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.240]   normal password and then Google authenticator on a smartphone, iPhone or Android phone.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.960]   And will Google authenticator will give you a five digit password, which you then add. So,
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.920]   that's two factor authentication, something you know, your password and something you have,
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.720]   this phone, which you have previously associated with the account.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.520]   Uh, the presumption being, well, to hack your account now, somebody's got to own your phone,
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:51.040]   as well as know your password. And that's a lot harder. Um, and it works fine. If that's all you
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.680]   want to do. The problem is that there are a lot of apps that use Google calendar, voicemail,
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.080]   uh, voice, uh, uh, contacts that don't understand second factor authentication. So in order to get
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.040]   into those, now you can't use your regular password anymore, Google will generate for you
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:13.600]   application specific passwords. Uh, these are 16 lowercase letters. So they're not very strong
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.920]   passwords. And here's my problem. First of all, the inconvenience involved because I use a lot
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.600]   of devices and a lot of Google on these devices. Uh, my, and I, and a lot of apps, and I have to go
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.880]   into all of those and use this, these special application specific passwords. It behooves you
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:33.200]   to make sure you use a different one for each app and to record which app so that you can
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.600]   revoke them, but it is not required and I've found out since, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.120]   that any of those passwords can be used again and again. Anytime.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:49.200]   Right. Because these, these are apps which need to off of Google on a regular basis and don't
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.480]   support two factor off. So your, your mail, your email client expects a username and a password
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.040]   for pop or imap. Right. So if you give it that application specific password, it uses that
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:04.800]   password over and over again and saves it. So, um, so if somebody, so it's, so it's, it's in effect
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:13.360]   replaced my secure password on Google with what I consider a fairly insecure 16 letter alphanumeric
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:19.440]   alpha, not even numeric password that can be used if somebody ever gets it for anything.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.880]   Except my Google account. I still need, I, so anything that supports two factor, I'm okay.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:31.920]   So the, the, the, then what Matt would say, I believe what Matt would say is, well, see,
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.400]   for that reason, it's more secure because even if they have that password, all they can do is
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.400]   delete your email or wreck your calendar. They can't take over your account.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.480]   What about the problem that all of us have in having an apps account and a regular Gmail account
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.040]   and the browser already gets confused between the two. Well, and that's how second factor,
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:56.960]   two factor authentication was in fact cracked in the cloud flare attack was the guy had Google
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.880]   apps and a regular account and they were able to use it somehow in the way I don't understand
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.600]   to get around it. By the way, I believe it was, it was, if not the same hackers, it was hackers in
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:12.000]   the same group that did the cloud flare hack. So I mean, yeah, the two factor off is a pain the way
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.880]   that Google has it implanted right now. I don't think that two factor off is bad. I think the user
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:22.960]   experience needs to be improved and it's much more painful if you have multiple accounts, which we
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:28.320]   do, but remember, most people don't. And if you have lots of devices, which we do, but again,
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:33.760]   most people don't. And Leo, I hear you the application specific passwords, the authenticator apps,
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.960]   you could have pins texted to you, you can print out a thing that you put in your wallet. Like it's,
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:43.840]   two factor off is confusing. And in fact, there was a lot about it that I didn't totally understand
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:50.480]   until this all happened and I did more reading. It's complex. It's a pain every 30 days, you know,
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.280]   even every 30 days when you have multiple accounts and multiple devices. I do not want to do this
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.240]   every 30 days. I mean, it feels a lot more often. Yeah. You know, if you've got five devices,
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.640]   you're always doing it once a week, you have to enter the stupid pin. It's a crappy crappy
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.520]   user experience. It needs to get better. But two factor off is definitely better than having a
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.360]   single password that you're entering everywhere. I mean, and I would turn it on. And in fact,
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.240]   I use two factor in a lot of other I use it on my bank account. I use it on my Blizzard,
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:26.080]   you know, account so that people can't steal my, my fab characters on Diablo. I use it at Facebook,
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.400]   by the way, has this capability. You can't log into another to Facebook from another device,
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.280]   unless you get it to send you an authentication. In every case, I use those because I'm not using
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.400]   apps that don't understand second party second factor. But the promise so many Google apps do not,
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.040]   so many third party apps do not. And so you end up that party apps right that interface with
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.760]   Google, particularly email clients, right? Every single email client that interfaces with Gmail
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.560]   would have to add support for two factor off, which is obviously insane. And I'm also concerned
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.520]   because now I have some insecure passwords floating around that will work.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.040]   The application specific passwords? Yeah. I have to revoke them. But until I revoke them,
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.600]   they're good. Right. Until you revoke them, they're good. It's true. And okay, sure,
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.160]   they can't take over my account, but they could delete all my email.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:17.680]   Right. Right. I mean, the reality is a security, right? It's there's always the trade off of
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.280]   security versus convenience. And there's never a completely secure, you know, it's only like so
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.640]   much security, right? There's never a guarantee that something is going to be perfect. I lock
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.000]   on my door. Someone can can bust through and I'm about how many locks I put on my door. There's
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.880]   always a way inside the house. It depends on how hard the person's going to try. Right. So
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.360]   like I totally get your point about having application specific passwords sort of putting
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.160]   you in the position that you were in to begin with. But you know, most people, you're not entering
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.040]   that password a million multiple times. You know, it would be good.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:53.600]   Paralless. I understand you can do this. I think it's sufficient to have a good, strong Google
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.960]   password and very important. And Matt should have had this turned on and did not. And everybody who
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:06.000]   has a Google account should do this immediately turn on account verification through a cell phone.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.880]   Because then if somebody owns your account, you can get a new password set to your cell phone
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.880]   and take it right back. Right. They'd have to have your cell phone to truly own you. I think you
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:24.080]   get 90% of the value of a manufacturer. But his cell phone was already worked. Oh, maybe that's it.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.080]   No, he didn't have two factor off on. He didn't have two factor off, but I don't know if he had
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:34.000]   a attached mobile phone. But it's sent by SMS. So it doesn't require a smartphone. It just
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.720]   requires a phone that can support SMS. And you can, you know, the video, Google's explainer video,
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:45.600]   which we can add in the show notes. They suggest even putting a phone number, like your spouse's
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:50.160]   phone number, or a trusted friend doesn't have to be your phone, which is interesting. I hadn't
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.080]   really thought about that. Of course, you have to, you know, if your spouse loses her phone,
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:00.080]   you've got to make sure that. But I think I think and then if you're worried, change your password
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.360]   every month, which is less of a pain than the two factor authentication, but it has all of the
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:11.760]   benefit. Nobody remembers to do that though. At least with the two factor off it prompts you
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.480]   and says, Hey, verify this device for another 30 days, it's a pain, but it makes me feel good.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:22.160]   About is like, okay, I feel secure. I know no one else is getting into my stuff. It's tough. I hear
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:28.480]   you Leo, but if you're worried, two factor, I am I have it for both my apps account and my Gmail
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:33.200]   account. And you know, because a lot of my personal information is out on the web, I try to answer
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.400]   all my security questions with completely unguessable answers, you know, where did you meet your spouse
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.120]   Pluto? Right. You know, just completely crazy. I do the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy answers.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:48.000]   I put that all in LastPass. I'm using two factor off on LastPass as well, because that's that's an
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.240]   account I don't want anyone to break into. That's a really important account. But see, here's the
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.400]   funny thing is that this wasn't about password security or LastPass or any of that. And in fact,
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:04.400]   it was a it was a social engineering. And in fact, it turns out, because people forget their security
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.920]   questions all the time, they're really useless. Because in many cases, you just call up say,
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:15.680]   I don't remember them. What else can I give you? I saw an argument by somebody and I was arguing
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:20.320]   against remembering passwords. And his argument is you because you get your password, password is
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:28.080]   back every time put in an nonsense password. And when you know, the app just suddenly forgets you,
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.640]   you just do an email drag to get a new password and use that one until the next time it happens.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:37.600]   Right. But your email account has to then be secure. But yeah, you could do that. You could just get a
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:42.400]   new get a new login every single time. It's a good article in the Atlantic yesterday.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:51.520]   Security questions, the biggest joke in online identification. And it makes this point that if
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.040]   companies are going to ignore security questions, then it's no point in even having security questions.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.280]   Yeah. They call this social engineering. To me, social engineering is like these
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:08.960]   hackers called AppleCare and like, you know, a charm them into giving them. This was a broken
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:14.400]   Apple policy that when you call in a representative and Apple may issue this statement that their
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.360]   policies weren't fully followed, which was complete BS because Wired was able to reproduce
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.560]   reproduce the situation multiple times kind of the next day. This was like, this is broken Apple
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:29.040]   policy. They were like, they want to get, you know, customers off the phone. Kevin made this point
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.320]   earlier in the week. You know, you want to reduce the amount of time that anyone is on the phone
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.720]   with an agent. So you make it as easy as possible to kind of bypass all the checks that you get
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.360]   online. So I mean, that Apple had to change, you know, had to change your policy and require
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:48.000]   more information. Right. The other the hackers do it for some cause. No, no, they did it for the
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:56.960]   law work. This off of the laws. And the short Twitter name, the MAT at MAT, which is why they
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:03.440]   targeted Matt. Yeah. And so they didn't know who he was. Lucky for us, Matt has an enormous
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.000]   platform and was able to get this fix and he had friends at Twitter who could restore his account.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.520]   And he, you know, he was able to make enough noise and has a bayon up platform and has a trusted
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.680]   voice and tech journalism to get this fixed within a couple of days. And imagine if this had been
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:22.240]   just a regular person, right? I just I this afternoon, this has happened to you long before
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:28.960]   to me. But I just suddenly got the Twitter verify thing. And so I'm now verified. Congratulations.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:34.320]   Oh, thank you so much. One of us. I didn't know that what they wanted was secret handshake.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:42.720]   I know what they wanted. You're not was. Oh, well, I'm out of the club. What's the air like up there?
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.920]   Just you and me.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:54.320]   Oh, yes. You know, a lot more followers than I do. Don't worry. Way more. I missed you.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.160]   How did you get how did you get verified? Can you read the poll? They just email you or
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:04.480]   came in as a as a as a DM and then they all they wanted was my phone number. So I guess
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.080]   we already know you. We already know what you you just mouth for. Yeah.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:13.280]   I don't know how I never was contacted by Twitter in any way. They just happened one day.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:17.200]   But the reason was is what they have now is my phone number. If he if he
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.800]   why I like this, if he if the account is is attacked, God forbid, I'm a nice guy, please don't.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.640]   They have a phone number now where they can call me and verify.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:31.760]   I thought the point of getting verified was that you people personalities who have,
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:36.480]   you know, accounts accounts that mock like fake Twitter accounts kind of made. I've never had
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.400]   that problem. And now that I've mentioned it, I'm sure that I will. And then I will go to.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.720]   That's that's that's the thing. I think the best thing to just keep your head down and pretend
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:50.240]   you are no one and just hide because you don't want to attract the tension of this guy,
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.840]   phobia and his friends and phobia. Love you, man. You're a great guy. We had a very civilized
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:02.480]   conversation. Phobia did a good service. I mean, it was the wiping the remote wipes was pretty
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:07.840]   malicious. And I think he said he regrets it. Yeah, he said and I'm assuming it's he said that he
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.600]   regret regretted that part. But he really did do a service. I mean, he closed up two major
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.120]   security holes at Amazon and Apple. Yep. This week. And in fact, that's his point of view.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.920]   He says exploiting methods for the better cause seems unlikely to get in trouble. If anything,
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:27.040]   it's beneficial and should be rewarded. This is what I'm saying. There is a touch of a cause to
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:31.920]   it besides the lulls. Well, no, that was not. I don't think his original intent. I think right now,
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:38.160]   retroactively, he's decided that he wants to. I think, I think, you know, what probably happens,
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.400]   like, he's a kid. And I think probably what happens is there's there's a disconnection between what
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:48.000]   you're doing and what its impact is on a human. And when he actually talked to Matt and realized
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.800]   what happened, he felt bad. Yeah, you don't have to delete a new dad's pictures of his daughter.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.840]   I mean, you really don't have to do that. But he wasn't thinking about that. He was just like,
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.400]   Oh, look, find my iPhone is on. Let's remote wipe. Oh, look, he has access to the gizmodo account.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.360]   Let's, you know, let's attack that. Let's just go. Yeah. How far can this go? Exactly.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:12.160]   And I think that, you know, I think that that's the real issue is that, and these, and these guys
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:16.720]   are handing this stuff around. So once a technique is discovered, it's immediately circulated.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:23.040]   I asked him how he started. He said he started hacking when he was 16, hacking gamer tags. He
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:29.280]   wanted a better gamer tag for his Xbox. And I wanted a cool gamer tag. So he hit up some people
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.040]   that I was friends with before they knew how to take accounts, friends with before they knew how
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:37.280]   to take accounts. He doesn't use punctuation. I saw a hit up some people that I was friends with
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:43.120]   before they knew how to take accounts. And I learned from them. I'll start on the Xbox, kids.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:49.440]   Get away drug. No, it's true. My nephews are interested in programming because they love the
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.280]   Xbox so much. That's how I started. I started because I love gaming. That's a good, that's a good
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:04.320]   entry level drug. But for you, it was pong mail. It was star Raiders. Anyway,
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:10.800]   yeah, I met, you know, I talked to Matt last night and he said, we talked about in Twitter,
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.880]   and last night, do listen to the Twitter, if you want to hear his sign of it. But he said,
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:20.400]   this is a hard story for him to cover because it's so personal and it feels bad. But at the same
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.520]   time, he knows. And I'm Ria, and I'm underscored this with him, that a lot of people are getting
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:29.120]   their eyes open. This is actually, you're doing a huge, even if it's just backup your data.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:36.400]   Yeah, even if it's just backup. You're doing a huge thing. And Matt Cuts wrote a life hacker
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:42.880]   article in which he says, turn on two step, please, you know, and explains how two step works.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:51.680]   Don't listen to Leo, Leo's full of it. Turn on. It's the right thing to do. And he has, you know,
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.920]   myth and reality and all of that. And so I agree. And by the way, Facebook has to, I didn't know
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.880]   this and I don't know if they even publicized it. I don't know when they turn it on, but Facebook
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:08.000]   also has two factor authentication. So turn that on. I had no idea. Everybody should.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.800]   Twitter. Twitter really should. Now they at least use OAuth, but they really should.
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:17.440]   Because Twitter's big. And again, this is that stewardship article. Twitter's becoming more
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:24.160]   than just some social network. So if you go into your, your settings on your Facebook,
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:31.840]   account settings, and then click the security tab, it's not clear, but you'll see login approvals.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.800]   That's, that's their two factor authentication. Approvals require when logging in from an
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.400]   unrecognized device. And if you go to edit that, don't show this because it's got all my phone
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.920]   numbers. Require me to enter a security code each time an unrecognized computer or device
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:51.840]   tries to access my account. And there's a couple of ways you can have text or if you have the Facebook
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:57.360]   app on your device, the Facebook app, it turns out has an authenticator built into it.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.560]   Please note we currently cannot send SMS text to Google voice numbers. Yeah, nobody can.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:08.240]   Even Google doesn't seem to be able to. No, no, it's not really a provider. It's a number.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:13.440]   But I just, I gave it my hard, hard line number. So that turn that on to,
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.760]   yeah, turn on two factor wherever you can. I used two factor on last pass too.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:23.440]   Yep. But it turns out that's not really the vulnerability.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:28.160]   Yeah, there's easier ways. Well, it would have, it would have mitigated the damage, right?
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.400]   Yep. This is my favorite story. And then we're going to get to our tip number and the tool of
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:38.000]   the week, because we've got triangulation coming up in a few minutes. The Ustream feed
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:52.400]   for the curiosity landing beat primetime CNN. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. There were watching 3.2
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.680]   million people in total that many peaked at half a million people watching at the same time.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:07.520]   That's higher than CNN Sunday primetime or NMSNBC. Fox gets 803. But you know, CNN did kind of,
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.600]   they were the only as far as I could tell channel even covering it live. Everybody else was doing
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.840]   Olympics and so forth. They didn't do a great job. We did a, I'm proud of the job. You did a great
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.800]   job. It's really fascinating. I've never had a case like this too, where I'm watching on one
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.600]   computer. It's working me three or four streams of things. Yes. And I did that too. And I noticed a
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:32.080]   lot of geeks did. I had CNN on the television. I had NASA TV. I had our thing. And I was chatting
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:38.000]   and tweeting. And the chat room, there were a thousand people in there. And really it was inspiring.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:46.320]   How excited the geek community was. And stunning to see how uninvolved the non-geek community was.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.840]   They didn't even know it was happening. Which says a lot about our future of science and
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.840]   technology, STEM education. Yeah. I joked, because there were a lot of, you know,
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:58.640]   time delay jokes around this. But I joked that NASA really should have changed the timing of
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:03.600]   this. So it happened in prime time. I tweeted that NBC would be showing it tomorrow in prime time,
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:12.720]   edited with commentary from Ryan Seacrest. And in fact, they didn't, I was shocked. They didn't.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.880]   I really, it was great to watch. There was also a really good Google plus hangout.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.680]   Yes. A bunch of them. A bunch of them. A bunch of them. A bunch of them.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:20.880]   Yeah. A lot of them. Yeah. A lot of them. Yeah. A lot of them. Yeah. A lot of them. Yeah. A lot of them.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:24.720]   One. He was also on our network. But so this was really encouraging to me. And it actually made
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:30.480]   me really think about our mission here at Twid. I think STEM is it. And I want to, I really want,
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:34.560]   I think we need to, you know, I was very disappointed. Lisa's son who's in fourth grade.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.640]   I said, are you excited about the Mars landings? And I said, no, I don't know anything about it.
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:45.440]   They had not talked about it in school. And that made me so sad. The opportunity to get a
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.840]   bunch of fourth graders excited about the fact that we land a Volkswagen sized science lab on
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:57.680]   Mars using a sky crane and nylon wires. Oh, yeah. And the visualizations that NASA did were so
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:05.920]   brilliant. NASA. Can we give props to NASA for their savvy, their internet savvy, their media savvy?
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.240]   I guess they had to be in this in this day. And they're well, but there was also a cultural
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:14.480]   thing was there. Right. They saw the PR, but they understood the through openness and the
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.240]   true trying to share everything and through bringing us in. Yes. That was going to get the
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:22.720]   assignment going. And it was true. And just just the great geek. This one, probably the best thing
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:28.000]   NASA could have. They didn't plan on it all was Mohawk. Oh, guy and superannuated hippie. Yeah,
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:36.080]   exactly. Let me see. There's Mohawk. They're superannuated hippie Mohawk guy and Pompadour guy.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:41.920]   Here they are, all three of them together in their blue shirts. And they became, we don't,
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.640]   I still don't know their names. I guess it's probably here somewhere. They became the stars.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.040]   Everybody was, this just shows you the, what the opportunity is the
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:56.720]   certain groups of people likes, like geeks and smart people and the people watch this network
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:01.520]   were, this was the one of the most important days, one of the most important events we lived through.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:08.000]   Glue to it. Glue to it. And I can promise you that we're going to, that is going to
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:14.800]   fill the gap here because there's just a horrible gap in science, technology, and math.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:20.720]   You ever done a show for kids? No, in fact, we're already planning it now. You are. In fact,
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:24.320]   I'm, well, I won't go into the detail, but we're, we're, we're starting to look at,
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:31.120]   we want to create another channel of educational content. Yeah.
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:35.920]   Go cool. Including stuff for kids, including stuff for grownups, including projects,
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.520]   including electronics, including science, technology, engineering, and math.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:43.600]   Do you know, have you met Esther Ojicki? No, I'd love to meet her.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:51.040]   She is, she's, she's talking about her before. I know. Yeah. Mother in law of Sergei and daughter
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:58.320]   in Google and, or forgetting, I'm thinking, but, but really amazed that she's a teacher at Palo Alto
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.040]   High and she teaches journalism there. And she came and brought her students to Michael. She brought
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.360]   her students to New York. She does this like every other year. She brings 40 students to New York
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:13.520]   to go around with an, a tour you would not believe of leading media organizations. And they just do
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:18.480]   great stuff. And she does amazing things with her students. She is one of the champion.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.360]   She and Lauren Weinstein are my two favorite Google plus users.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:27.120]   Esther's in there with great lengths, great stuff. And she's a heck of an educator. And I think
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:31.760]   she'd be really good to involve. Well, there's a lot of people I, I am, I'm starting to put this
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:35.920]   together. Wouldn't be until next year, but it is something that this really galvanized that in my
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:42.880]   mind that we really need to, um, is since the schools don't seem to be interested, or at least most,
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:48.960]   some schools. And since obviously a television has completely, talk about stewardship, completely
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:54.880]   dropped the ball. There's another great guy named Will Richardson. Look him up. Really is very good
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.480]   at educating young people with, with the stuff and bringing the web into the classroom and stuff.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:03.200]   Yeah. And I, I just wrote this big grant proposal that blog, I've blogged about parts of this,
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:10.160]   trying to rethink how we, to adults, how we reteach, rethink teaching tools. Yeah. And, and how we set
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:15.120]   outcomes first and then curate online stuff and rethink how we do it. And, and we've got a scale.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:20.400]   We're bankrupting future generations with the cost of education, that alone is irresponsible.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:24.080]   We're setting them in the wrong ways of things that, that we don't need, and that are not going
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.440]   to be good for them. We're boring them. Um, yeah, I think you can do more than just push science,
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.200]   technology and education. I think you can start to change education, Leo. Uh, I think we want to
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:37.600]   do that. Although there's people ahead of us, like Salman Khan and Sebastian Thrun.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:42.000]   But I think this is part of a movement. There's something, there's lots of opportunity.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.120]   Yeah. That's for sure. And by the way, the Mohawk guy tweets as tweets out loud on Twitter,
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.000]   Bobak F the flight director on the Mars science lab. And the story for those of us who knows,
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:58.240]   he gets a different haircut for every mission. Oh, oh, cool. So his colleagues, I think he gave
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:03.520]   them a choice and his colleagues picked this one. That's a mistake and I'm never going to do it.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:09.920]   So stop asking Chad. The video of all of them, like rejoicing and
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:16.880]   embracing crying. It was, Oh, well, I think they shared probably the same feeling we all had that
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:25.600]   this cannot possibly work. Have you seen what they're trying to do? This cannot possibly work.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:31.920]   And it did. And it's a boy, it's kind of neat to see this at the same time as you see the Olympics,
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:39.680]   where you see human achievement in two different spheres. Just it's mind-boggling. It gives me,
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:45.360]   it gives me hope. Both through science and both through, well, I don't, yes, I guess you're right.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.640]   I think Olympic performance very much influenced by some, some more than others.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:52.320]   Yeah, by what we've learned. All right. One, I got to play this.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:34:00.320]   It has nothing to do with Twig, but I just love it. Did you see Conan talk about Apple and
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.800]   Samsung? We got to Samsung. We got to skip the ad. So hold on just a second.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:09.360]   And although it's a pretty funny ad, it's on YouTube. Conan O'Brien, of course,
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:15.520]   this shows you that at least in some quarters, what's going on in technology has sunk into
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.800]   the consciousness of normal people, because he's talking about the Samsung versus Apple
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.920]   copyright trial and patent trial. The audience gets the joke.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:29.520]   And the audience gets the joke. Here you go. This is from Conan O'Baron. Oh, no, I'm getting noise.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:36.000]   Oh, let me unplug it again, unless you want to play it, Chad. I think there's something going on
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:45.360]   with it. I think if I replug, silencing happens. Conan's pretty, Conan's pretty.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:51.040]   He's claiming that Samsung copied iPhone technology to market its own products.
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:56.640]   Well, Samsung's vice president of electronics has already released a video that's defending
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.800]   his company's video message defending Samsung. Let's take a look.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:08.960]   Hello. Apple's claim that Samsung has copied their technology is an allegation we're vigorously
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.320]   denying. Since we entered the personal electronics space, Samsung has created products that as you
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:20.080]   can see, bear no similarity to Apple. It's the greater edge of our Galaxy phone.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.920]   And what about our Galaxy tablets? Not even close.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:32.400]   Not just electronics. Samsung's originality is also on display in our home appliances.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:39.600]   Whether it's our new Macrowave oven, our VAC Pro vacuum cleaner, or iWasher with
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:46.240]   sprawl wheel control. They come to our retail stores where you can talk more about our products
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:53.040]   with a Samsung smart guy. A lot of people ask how does Samsung stay so original,
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:59.360]   so innovative. It's very simple really. We stay through to the vision of Samsung founders to farm
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:10.560]   jobs. Okay, Samsung's Apple. That probably did more to win the trial for Apple than any motion,
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:15.760]   any deposition. Pretty amazing. All right, we're going to do a, we got to run because we've got a
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:19.280]   great interview coming up. Daniel Suarez for triangulation talking about his new book,
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.200]   Kill Decision. But before we go, time for our tip number and tool of the week starting with you,
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:29.200]   Gina Trapani, your tip of the week. Well, we talked about this a little bit earlier. If you
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.000]   want to get your Gmail messages in your search results, you have to opt in and do so. Go to
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:42.240]   google.com/experimental/gmailfieldtrial. No space is no doubt or anything. And you can opt in to try
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:47.840]   out getting your Gmail messages. Google Apps accounts are not supported. So you got it. You got to
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.080]   just use your vanilla Gmail account and you can give it a try. And if you don't like it,
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:57.440]   you can opt out and you won't see it anymore. And you and I got accepted right away, although I've
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:02.240]   seen others in our chat room who say they did not. They didn't. So there might be a little bit
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:07.280]   of a wait. You'll get an email notification letting you know if you get accepted. Yeah.
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:15.120]   Jeff numbers. Well, at that Google search event this morning, the next web had a report from it
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:20.720]   with some wonderful numbers in there. Thank you next web. Google crawls 20 billion web pages a day
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:28.640]   out of 30 trillion URLs on the web. The company now serves 100 billion searches every month.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.960]   And by the way, the search team has made 530 improvements to search already this year.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:39.120]   More than one a year, one a day rather. That's impressive. Have I talked about Mighty Text?
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:44.640]   Did I do Mighty Text yet? I don't think so. It's a Chrome plugin. So I love this. If you're using
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:51.120]   an Android phone, it does not work on iOS. Mighty Text is a Chrome plugin that lets you Mighty
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:57.120]   Text.net/app. You know what? Don't show it because now I'm so paranoid about my numbers and
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:02.320]   my emails and other people's numbers. I almost don't want to show this stuff online. But
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:09.120]   what it does is it allows you to go to the desktop, start typing text messages. It uses your
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:14.400]   Android phone. It's tied into that account and continues threads back and forth. So you see the
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.000]   text on the phone, you see the text on your Chrome. It is really great. It will also notify you
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:30.400]   if you get text on the desktop or if your phone rings on the desktop and it's free. MightyText.net
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:40.400]   is a Google plugin and I think you're going to really, really like it.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:46.800]   Except it's not compatible with my Nexus 7. No, because it's not a phone, dude.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:56.880]   Have you noticed that? Hello. You need an Android phone. That would be the one little caveat.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.400]   What does that mean? I actually asked them. I said, what does that mean?
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.920]   I just put my face and that's what I got. You borked it, dude.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:09.280]   It needs the device needs to have a phone number associated with it, basically.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.400]   Oh, I see. Is that what that means? I'm assuming. Oh, no, it's the logo.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:21.600]   Oh, OK. I thought that was the first thing. What is that? Easter egg or error message?
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:24.960]   It needs an Android phone and I asked them if it'll work with iOS and they say,
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.280]   no, the restrictions on iOS prevent it from working with iOS. But it does work.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:33.120]   It's more than Google Voice. By the way, pictures will go through.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:39.920]   Yeah, so no, it's more than Google Voice. Google Voice does let you text from the desktop,
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:44.400]   but it's only text and it's using your Google Voice number. Anyway, just try it and you'll see
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:49.840]   what I mean. I really like it. It's kind of like iMessage for Android is, I guess,
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.560]   probably the closest thing to compare to. I've started to get notifications in Google Voice
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:59.760]   if someone has sent me an MMS and then I get it via email. Oh, well, that works.
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:02.640]   Which is a little better than not getting any notification at all.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:04.880]   Yeah, it used to be they'd send you a picture and you didn't even know.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.280]   Yeah, you had no idea. Right. So, but do you just say an MMS, you know, it says,
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.120]   it sends you a text message saying MMS received and then I went to my email and I saw the picture.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:16.640]   So, Google Voice getting a little better, but that is definitely one of the most frustrating
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:23.440]   things about it. Well, it's been fun, gang. So glad that we're back.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:26.880]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org. Glad to be back.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.760]   Anything else in your Hopper that you want to tell us about?
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:36.080]   Nothing much. Just heads down on cracking on ThinkUp, working on a new to-do text release too.
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.240]   So, you know, nothing much. Just follow me on Google+ if it's been a little more time there
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:43.520]   and on Twitter. That's it. Perfecting that meatball recipe.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.680]   Perfecting that meatball recipe. Yeah, baby.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.640]   I may have to put that up so people can fork it.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:54.400]   Oh, I would definitely fork that. Definitely.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:59.600]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis. Always a pleasure buzz machine.com.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.440]   You, as always. You can be on CNN again soon so we can see you in an update.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:06.960]   Not that I know. I'm appearing in my students' Kickstarter video.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.640]   So, I want to give them a quick look. Oh, yeah.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:14.160]   Go to Kickstarter narratively. I know I've done a wonderful business of changing
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:17.840]   narrative form covering New York and New Ways, got together a whole bunch of young people.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.800]   So, let's make the business work.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.240]   There are so many cool things in this world. Yeah.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:27.840]   The young people. It's all about the young people. The whippersnappers.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.840]   That's why I hang out with them. Yeah.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.560]   And I guess since we mentioned App.net, we should talk about
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:39.920]   join.app.net. It is a paid Twitter alternative. The idea being,
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:46.000]   if they don't, if you, you know, they don't sell ads, you kind of, it's like a better thing
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.880]   somehow. And they're so close. Five days left. It's not a Kickstarter.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.880]   It's like, because it violates Kickstarter's terms of service, he's doing it himself.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:00.000]   But it's really cool. And I've been on it. I have an app.net account.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.520]   And I'm just really having fun with it. And I do believe that an open API, an ad-free experience,
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:10.080]   it's worth it to me. And I'd like to see more people support that.
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.720]   So, join.app.net. You could find out more. And he's got the Kickstarter-like video on all that.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:21.200]   Hey, thank you, everybody, for being here. We appreciate it. We do the show every Wednesday
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:28.560]   afternoon, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time. That would be 20, what did I do? 12 plus 1 is 13
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:35.120]   plus 7 is 2000 UTC on Twitter.tv. Or you can always get on demand versions after the fact.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:44.000]   Wherever finer podcasts are supplied, including Twitter.tv/Twig. We'll be back next week. We'll
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:54.000]   see you then. Thanks for joining us on This Week in Google.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.580]   (upbeat music)
