[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.720]   in Google, though much awaited.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.440]   This is for us.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.600]   This is a big day in Google land.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.440]   Jeff Jarvis joins us from Seoul, Korea,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.120]   where is 5 in the morning?
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.320]   Nice.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.960]   Thank you, Jeff.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.680]   You are above and beyond.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.960]   That is a commitment to the cause.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.560]   Thank you.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.000]   My pleasure.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.800]   Really appreciate it.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.360]   And of course, because you're in Seoul,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.080]   you have the best Skype connection you've had all year.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   I know.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080]   Look at that.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.440]   Is the Internet just making four up?
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.560]   It's got 94 down, 92 up.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.200]   I'm so jealous.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.160]   So jealous.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160]   That's good stuff.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.480]   Gina Trapani from New York, New York.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.800]   Good to see you.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.640]   Good to see you, too.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.320]   I'm so excited.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.680]   This is a huge, huge news day.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.360]   Of course, I'm sad because I did all about Android last night.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.880]   But we could talk about everything that happened today.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.440]   You put it to bed last night without knowing
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   what the morning would bring.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.040]   But we all kind of knew that today would be a big day.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.920]   We rocked the show saying, we know for sure
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.760]   that all this stuff is going to happen tomorrow.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.920]   It's probably going to be lollipop.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.360]   We're going to hear about all the new Nexus.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.520]   And of course, it's going to happen tomorrow
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.680]   because we do all about Android on Tuesdays.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.640]   So the big Android news seems to always
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.560]   break on Wednesdays.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.060]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.520]   But we get to catch it on Twig.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.200]   So that's good.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.640]   And then we'll talk about it, of course, next week.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.360]   And to be honest, nothing surprising, right?
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.440]   Or is there?
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.080]   No.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.560]   No.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.240]   I mean, we said last night we knew pretty well.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.080]   It was going to be lollipop, even though there was quite
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.840]   a bit of misdirection going on.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.680]   The statue guy was dropping a lot of hints about licorice.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.200]   There was a lady finger eating a lady finger
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.720]   in one of Google's videos.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.400]   I mean, they didn't do an audition.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.360]   They had it like an audition video where they were auditioning
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.760]   for the next dessert.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.320]   So for those of you who don't watch the show regularly--
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   and I've never heard of something called Google--
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.200]   you Bing users maybe don't know that Google names
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.000]   its versions of Android after desserts.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.120]   First one was not a dessert, right?
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.400]   That was just alpha.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.840]   Don't cupcake.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.480]   Yeah, because it was alpha and beta.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.080]   And then it was C was cupcake.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.760]   It was a first release version.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.720]   Donut.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.280]   Eclair.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   Eclair.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   Froyo.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.280]   Froyo.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   Gingerbread.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   Honeycomb.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.760]   Honeycomb, which had a short lived--
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.600]   it was the tablet version.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.760]   Short lived.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.280]   Honeycomb was the redhead of stepchild, for sure.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   Then--
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.800]   Ice cream sandwich, yeah.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   Jelly bean.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   Kit Kat.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.440]   And now we are on Elle.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   Mm.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.880]   That was very sad you two.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.400]   That we knew those?
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.280]   All those brain cells devoted to that.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.520]   It's weird, isn't it?
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   Here's the casting.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   Google did it.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520]   I think this is really great for Elle.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   It was cute.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.520]   It was cute.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   Lava cake?
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.520]   Ladyfinger.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.520]   Show me sweet.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.520]   Sweet er.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.520]   I'm in the drop.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.320]   Oh, that's perfect.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.280]   This is-- quiet please, casting in session.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   This is hysterical.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.280]   Oreo.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   There can be--
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.240]   I like the lady finger eating a lady finger.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240]   Recursion.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.400]   Google has such a great sense of humor.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.400]   I just love that.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   Totally.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400]   Totally.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.240]   Now I'm going to make news out of it, though, because last time they did Kit Kat-- and I
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.360]   was a little miffed as a lot of people were.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.880]   Where's my Kit Kat bar?
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.680]   That they used a brand name.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.120]   They apparently made a deal in which no money was exchanged with Hershey's or Nestle's,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.080]   depending on which country for Kit Kat.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.040]   And I thought, well, do you think they waited to do Lollipop to the last moment, hoping
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.800]   that they could make a deal with what I don't know, Laffy Taffy?
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.400]   I don't know what the delay was about.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.840]   I think they just weren't ready.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   I think they simply weren't ready.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.440]   They didn't have the statue.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.080]   They didn't have the promo video made.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   The statue wasn't made.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.720]   The statue wasn't built yet.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.440]   I just think that they weren't ready.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.640]   They wanted to do some sort of new launch.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.440]   It was just the blog post.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.840]   It wasn't like there was an event today or anything.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   No.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.720]   Somebody asked me yesterday, oh, Mr. Apple fan, I bet you're not going to cover the Google
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   event tomorrow.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   And I said, well, I will.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.320]   It's a word one, but it was a surprise release.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   We cover it.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.800]   Are you an Apple fan or an Apple enemy?
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   I can't keep it straight.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   Depends who you ask.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.600]   So here's the follow up, by the way, to the L casting.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.000]   Lickrish, do you see red licorice?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.440]   Notifications, notifications.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.960]   Notifications now, not about you.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.560]   Show me sweet.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   He's memorizing.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.760]   Oh, this is the full length one, I guess.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.760]   Oh, OK, OK.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.360]   I went in there and I lagged.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   I lagged.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.800]   And I could love the cake has a little berry in his hair.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.720]   Oh, OK.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.680]   And if you don't feel like you get it in one take, which I know you will, you just
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.880]   demand another one.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.560]   And say sorry, don't say excuse me, don't say please, you say I want to do it again.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.800]   I know you.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   I know you.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.640]   Do you know it's L this time, right?
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   We.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   You're you.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   Wait, who's that guy?
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.480]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.400]   What is the giant sponge with coconut on it?
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   What is that?
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   What is that thing?
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.840]   Chat room, you've got to figure that out.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.720]   It's an L dessert.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.280]   What is it?
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.040]   Or is it MNO talking?
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.160]   I don't know.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.400]   See, I don't know.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.880]   L'Oreal.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.920]   What is that?
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.880]   It's weird looking.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.000]   It's coconut.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.240]   It's a lacqueroon.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.560]   What is it?
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.280]   A lacqueroon.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.920]   What is it?
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.680]   Anyway, let's continue on.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.520]   Focus.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.320]   Focus.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.200]   Your objective is to go in there and crush these people's dreams.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   Oh, no.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.720]   No.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.200]   No.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   Focus.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   Thank you guys.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   Those are some-- I've never had them before.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   Oh.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   Oh.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   Oh.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   Oh.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   Oh.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   Hey, next year is M. Muffins.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   Oh, my god.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   Oh.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   This is probably exactly what it's like.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   This would be great.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.920]   This is pretty great.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.200]   Lollipop is here.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.680]   Let's see if it's a good part.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.200]   So that woman was dressed as licorice, right?
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   Dr. Larry l'Oreal
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.660]   Sorry, mr. Ladyfinger who is this guy?
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.880]   Nice lmp lemon meringue pie lickrish
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:26.560]   Lemon drop lava cake. Who is this guy? Yeah, there is this lemon drop. No, we saw lemon drop. Who is this guy?
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.520]   Lado
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   What the hell is a ladue?
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.800]   And then there they are. This is me is these are what the doons are they look like
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.520]   Across between it must be an Indian dessert. It's an Indian deep fried thing or just a meatball. I'm not sure
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.960]   It's gotta be it's one of them. You know, okay, and I don't mean this to sound disparaging in any way
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.280]   But every time I go to an Indian restaurant, I skip the dessert
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.400]   Because it's like that
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.160]   Oh, often it's in a kind of a sweet liquid
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.400]   Yeah
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   Not a fan. It's an acquired
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.120]   Love Indian food, but the dessert
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:16.680]   Anyway, no ladoo it's lollipop doesn't mean anything right?
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:23.180]   There's no prize and they couldn't do a deal with a lifesaver
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:31.520]   I think that they probably got the message when I and others in the tech press it
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.320]   I don't want to say a brand name every time I'm talking about your virgin of
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.920]   Android and in fact we did and kick-ass got a lot of free publicity because of it. It's just not appropriate for a code name
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.160]   I don't think
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.960]   Lolly, so this is the first number jump since when
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.680]   Five yeah five so four two was a
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.720]   Jelly bean for four was Kit Kat. So I think since ice cream. No ice cream sandwiches for right
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:03.760]   So since honeycomb honeycomb was honeycomb was four this I should know off the top and I do not so
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.840]   Gingerbread not being used since gingerbread
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.160]   Good gingerbread was
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:21.720]   Ice cream sandwiches for was four oh three to four four honeycomb was what four right no honeycomb was three
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.760]   So it's the biggest jumps since honeycomb
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.680]   Since honeycomb how long was that?
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.440]   Eitre
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.520]   It's a
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.000]   11
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.820]   So why five is it well? It's the new look right?
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:43.840]   Material design. I like material design. It's beautiful. I'm very excited about material design. It's flattish
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.520]   It's flattish. Yep. Yep
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.840]   It's
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.820]   Supposedly runs really well on low-powered devices
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:58.800]   So it's the it's the you know the next getting the next one billion online because all those gradients are expensive in CPU terms
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.080]   Mm-hmm and the and the gooey stuff and the lighting effect and all that that's expensive
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.080]   Mm-hmm
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.320]   So are they limit? Yeah, I guess they're kind of eliminating lighting effects. This is all very
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.480]   flat
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.280]   Yeah, definitely very flat for sure and and
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:24.720]   The chrome tabs are sort of first-class citizens like each web process is its own process. There's a lot to L
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:34.560]   I don't know though. There's I mean there are definitely our transitions like things don't transport they slide and shift that Elle's also focuses on big images and
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:44.040]   You know sort of and also as all of Android kind of has this responsive design where it fits perfectly on whatever size green that you've got
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.760]   Here's an interesting. This is this is the slideshow describing material
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:55.080]   The interesting page seven users initiate change changes to the interface derive their energy
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.840]   from user
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.200]   actions
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.600]   motion that cascades from touch respects and reinforces the user is prime mover
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.320]   This is the kind of thinking that goes into this stuff. There's a message being passed
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.440]   subliminally to the user
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.080]   And like in this case you are the you're the god you're the power
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.700]   Animation is choreographed on a shared stage
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.240]   Motion provides meaning whether just don't just have motion for motion sake
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.280]   It's feedback
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:34.360]   Right when you move when you touch when you swipe everything should move with you when I move you move
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:42.440]   Color surface and iconography emphasize actions. This is somebody put some thought into this
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.000]   definitely
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.080]   That's if they didn't put some thought into it before but I mean I like it. I like it so
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.720]   One of the things we know in fact I was I'm very pleased to hear this they're gonna put
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.280]   Lolly pop on going all the way back to the Nexus 4
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.400]   You'll get updates on the on the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 5
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.040]   Great, yeah
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.440]   This will just take three years to roll out to all the phones, but that's right your carrier may get made me
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.040]   lollipop block you but
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.520]   If you've got an excess you'll get it right away, and then I'm very excited about the Nexus 6
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.640]   So
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   What what are you laughing at?
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   No, it's that expensive. Yeah
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.200]   That I'm not so excited about
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   Nexus line has traditionally been the low low cost
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.240]   The new Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9 power by lolly pop will come out
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:46.120]   Well, the Nexus 9 will be available for pre-order October 17th, and we'll hit stores on November 3rd
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:53.320]   16 9 is a tablet. It's the successor to the Nexus 7. It's 8.9 inches the 16 gigabyte version
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.920]   $399
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.560]   That's the one that offsets me. I think seven was a was a great size 225 bucks
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:09.640]   But nine is just too big it's it's it bothers me so so so now I guess the joke is so is my six
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.160]   Did I get rid of a tablet is my six a tablet, but but no there's quite a difference here?
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.640]   You know who I who I think should feel a little ripped off or people like me who bought the Moto X the 2014 Moto X
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.240]   Because essentially this is a six inch Moto X
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:31.400]   Is this the death of the small phone? No in fact isn't Google keeping the five around I
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:37.320]   Think yeah, I think they are because because they realize that people may want a smaller phone
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.640]   Mm-hmm. I
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.880]   Don't think the small phone is dead
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:46.520]   But I think we're now going to see a very clear division between four and I think 4.7 is kind of the sweet spot
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.400]   4.7 and five and a half and up
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.720]   Five and a half to six those are gonna be the two battery life on the well
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:59.440]   That's why so the thing I like the Moto X in many respects, but the battery life is too short for me. It's 12 hours
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.680]   What about what about the they're claiming?
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.920]   Claiming significant it's a bigger much bigger battery and they're claiming 24 hours
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.680]   Because that is the main selling point of the one plus one as far as I'm concerned. Yep
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.760]   You too. Yeah, definitely and we'll talk about the new update. I don't know if you guys got it, but it's yeah, I got it
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   Yeah, my my
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.920]   Lock screen is now different from my
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:27.960]   Watch my calls for my screen savers makes me very happy. I have I have I finally have hold on a second here. I have
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.000]   land in this
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   And McCartney
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.440]   Wait a second and marks and angles
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:42.240]   Aren't you aren't you lucky actually I've had different pictures for some time, but
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   The new one gives you it's just different. It's you have to turn on custom screen a lock screen
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.040]   This is not it actually. Oh, I should all that before it didn't work
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:16:00.160]   So well, I know this is I'm not using it and I never have but let me turn on the lock the new custom lock screen
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.920]   Wait, but we're we're getting distracted
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.640]   We are getting distracted stop I'll save that for later
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.560]   So easy there's so much to talk about but let's not
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.960]   Throw it all in at once. They also announced a
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.720]   Nexus TV device, which is kind of
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:27.080]   Yeah, this was the one surprise. Yeah, we didn't know about this the Nexus player they call it with remote control
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.800]   $99 optional controller $40
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   Are
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.600]   They're pictures of the Nexus player. I don't see them maybe yeah, I've seen them
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.920]   It's just a little wrong thing. It's running Android TV. It will it's kind of an uyah competitor. It'll run games
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:51.120]   So this is why does it roll control cost 40 bucks. That's why I don't get right. It's almost half
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.520]   Well, not quite but almost half the cost of the device itself
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.420]   It's well, I mean you can use your phone to control this thing, right? You don't need this controller, right?
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:08.400]   Okay, the Nexus player has voice search. It's a lot like the Android fire TV really
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.480]   Was an AT&T getting destroyed this week I said as so is that fire selling
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:24.160]   Oh wait a minute. So you get the remote control with this. Oh you do don't get the gaming controller. This is just like fire TV
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.800]   So this is the gaming controller for $40
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.680]   Because this thing and that you get
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.520]   That's right
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.480]   So the difference between
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:44.480]   Nexus TV and Apple TV is what well the big it's the same difference between the Nexus the Apple and everything else
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.320]   which is only the Apple TV supports iTunes and
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.600]   And Apple TV does not allow apps so you can't have gaming on the Apple TV either
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:02.160]   So I don't think Apple TV is unless you're really in the iTunes universe Apple TV is the right thing for most people
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:10.920]   This competes directly against Roku and the fire TV. Let me go to the Google website here and the chrome cast
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.520]   I mean, this is basically the no no no no no
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.600]   Chromecast is so different
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:24.560]   It feels like the Chromecast is like a light version of this right because this is all cast ready like this all works with the Chromecast stuff
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.200]   It seems like this is like the device for people who want more than the Chromecast
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.600]   They demoed this stuff at IO and I was confused them trying to figure out what the real difference is
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:42.240]   So look at the apps that's interesting because that's that's a set worthy of Roku next and Netflix of course
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.160]   I heart radio crackle tune in Hulu plus
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.120]   YouTube
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.360]   Ted daily motion Pandora
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.080]   Where are you on what's what's yeah? Well?
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.600]   Twit is a Android app. So I don't know maybe
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.880]   What's missing on here Plex is there? That's good. There's gotta be I mean all you need is a
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.800]   Amazon's missing Amazon's missing. Yes, that's a big one
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:15.160]   So now you have to get the fire TV if you're an Amazon streaming customer the eye the Apple TV if you're an iTunes customer
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:21.040]   That's kind of unfortunate. I don't see Google. Oh, there it is Google movies and Google. Yeah if you're a Google movies person
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.920]   You'd you'd want this one. I have a sport TV. It basically does. I want all of them. Yeah
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:32.640]   So it's an Intel atom processor 1.8 gigahertz quad core
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.520]   802.11 AC which is nice
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:41.160]   HDMI out that's you'll how you'll hook it up to your TV you get the remote with the player
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.840]   and
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.360]   Severe shortage of HD at lies. Yeah, you got to get an AV receiver. That's the only solution
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.560]   I bit that bullet a long time ago, but that's good because it really confuses spouses
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   Spousal confusion device
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:07.720]   Why can't I just turn on the TV on the ends? X spouses - which is handy
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:16.080]   Lisa's Lisa's husband came over he couldn't figure out he would turn off the TV and then the AV receiver would turn back on
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:22.400]   It's sorry
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.760]   I can't tell you have any times I've been with friends who've gotten the call from their significant other like how do I turn on the TV?
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.760]   I just
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.320]   It's so true and it's like all this alright. Just what you do. I know media player like is the light on
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.320]   Video sources set like it's
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   It's a universal experience
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.240]   Well AV receiver just makes it worse
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:51.480]   Way too much blood deriving too much pleasure from that you said it kept turning itself back on I
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:21:02.960]   Don't see HBO go on here. I don't she's showtime anywhere on here. That's two big omissions. I
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.600]   Really want to see HBO go on this, but I presume that Google could make those deals or I'm not sure how this works really
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.360]   Is it did you guys get this from Google IO is this what did you get one?
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:21.440]   No, we didn't get one, but but Jason snagged they had developer kits and Jason not one of those
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.440]   So I mean, you know, it's the black box
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.760]   He's been using him with an early preview. So now this is this is cast ready
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.320]   So if you go if I can already cast from that, okay, you're good. I don't need an app for that, right?
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.480]   Right. I don't think showtime anywhere is cat does a crumb cast though
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.360]   And for Twitter, I mean, there's got to be a Twitter app there is Twitter cast yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.840]   There you go. So so you're on the
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.800]   Well promoted to it cast
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:55.760]   It's frustrating because H showtime does not have crumb cast support that makes me mad
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.080]   And you still have to log in to infinity by the way big story HBO
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.480]   Let let let out that they are gonna end that next year that you'll start to be able to buy a subscription
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.760]   HBO that will not be tied to a cable provider
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:19.280]   Man for himself. That's great. That's the crack in the wall if they go through with that. It's all over. It's the end
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.840]   That's gonna be awesome. Yes
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.880]   Couldn't happen to an nicer bunch of people the cable companies
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:34.480]   Last week I think was also the Google fibers said the reason that one of the reasons problems they have in early now is the
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.120]   negotiations with cable companies and
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.240]   And they get it and this is the case where Google gets a much worse deal because they're not right in our tell right
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.160]   It's it's a horrid horrid good to be a cartel
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.400]   Handy
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:56.160]   So those are the big announcements. I'm excited about the Nexus 6 because even though it doesn't have the moto maker
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.480]   Support you can't get leather
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.480]   There's only two colors
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.880]   midnight blue and
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.880]   Snowy pearly ice or something
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.720]   black and white
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.920]   Let's just let's just say call it spade is paid black and white
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.360]   But it is a six inch screen which I think is good
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:19.840]   I have been using a six inch screen on the nocea 1520 and I think it's good. I don't think you're gonna hate it. It is big
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.400]   No, I've gotten this is been a transition for me and I've gotten used to this and this this feels normal
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.860]   But you know here in Korea and by the way, let's let's just say in Korea the world laughed at you Korea for your fat
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:36.880]   Let's you were right. Mm-hmm. Yeah, everybody thought all those silly Koreans all carrying these gigantic phones and they were way ahead
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.280]   um, but the right when I put this next to it a
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.400]   Note 4
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.720]   It looks almost the same size, but when you see someone holding a note a note it just looks so much bigger
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.280]   That's a design thing. I think you know the key is
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   the is a
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.400]   You know taping the edges and so forth and yeah
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   And bezel size what I'm really thrilled about so I wanted to love the Moto X
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.920]   I loved the Moto X last year. I thought it was the phone of the year last year despite its
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.280]   720p screen and it's only weak camera
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.320]   Uh, and they fixed some of those things in the Moto X, but the battery life was was not great
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:20.480]   It was a little frustrating and I was a little disappointed because even though it looked like they had dual ported speakers on the front
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.920]   Only one of them was a music speaker. The other one was the phone speaker
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:32.080]   So google is putting out an x-6, which is essentially a Moto X with bigger battery life a bigger uHD screen by the way
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:38.560]   It's not just 1080p. It's not whatever. What is the new thing? Oh, I just turned my flashlight on by stroking my phone
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.360]   It's easy
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.960]   Like that and the flashlight turns on because I like it keep it off
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.520]   So
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.520]   Things just got weird
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.520]   Um
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.640]   But they have front dual stereo speakers, which is one of the things I loved on the HTC one
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.800]   Yeah, well, why are you not carrying your Moto right now? You're carrying your battery life
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.520]   Really about us
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.760]   And and we'll talk about this later, but the new r
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.160]   38 update for a cyanogen by the way, I am now
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:20.960]   Convinced that the best version of android is cyanogen mod. Do you not agree all of you? It's it's pretty great far in a way
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.640]   Far in a way
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.920]   And one of the things it does is it takes raw images now with the camera in addition to a jpeg
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.680]   And uh, that's huge. It's going to be a better camera
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.720]   Going to be a better camera on the on the shamu
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.040]   Nexus six
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.760]   If I want to update get it get a new seven inch tablet because i'm going to be resistant about this nine inch stuff
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.400]   And I get a samson seven inch don't you know you're gonna have a six inch phone
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.760]   Well, but but Leo this is quite a difference
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.120]   Well, that's five five
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.600]   That's five five. It's not six. I got the sanitians
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.040]   I'm on the plane and we're on the plane watching movies on this, which is better
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.080]   Number two, it fits the pocket. So it's smaller number three
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.800]   I can type on this easier for big documents, which is better. I don't think the half inch
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.360]   No, you're probably make that difference
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.800]   To this okay, and in fact you know given that these
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.640]   One plus ones that we're all wielding are 350 bucks
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.320]   And the next is six is going to be 650 bucks. Yeah, that price. Yeah
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   64 gig is 700 bucks. Yeah twice as much twice as much
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.760]   Yeah, but it says this is on the back leo
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.320]   I
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:44.000]   Can't go another half inch you guys this this five five is I can't do it this five five is taking me a while
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.680]   I can't just
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.200]   I can't do it. I don't I mean listen. I love the nexus line and and yeah
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.440]   I mean, I love the front-facing speakers. I really missed out from the HTC one that was one of the things
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.000]   I loved about it, but yeah, no, I just can't do another half inch
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.440]   I was on the subway, you know the other day trying to type out an email and like there's just some places
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.600]   You know, you can't be holding on and typing at the same time. There's just some places my thumb doesn't go
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.680]   Well, that's a special need though. We don't I don't ride the subway. I mean for little people
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.040]   No and subway riders right in one handed
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.040]   This whole thing about one handed which make people apple guys make a big deal about it
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.520]   I don't really understand it because I haven't had a one-handed phone in years
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.600]   Yeah, no, I agree
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.160]   I think people make a bigger deal about it than than we can but there are times when it's just like and I feel slippery
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.840]   And I feel like I'm gonna I just don't feel like I can get my grip on it the way that I would like
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.920]   So the five five has definitely been a push for me. I don't think I could do six six is
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:42.800]   It is it is a big difference when I handle the 1520. It's big. It feels big in your hand your hand
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.840]   It's a little stretch. It's actually good. Yeah, you gotta wrap it
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.080]   I've been I've been using it to stretch my hand in preparation for the Nexus six
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:56.240]   Nexus six you'll be able to order not till October 29th and it'll come
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.720]   uh in the second week of uh
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.320]   November
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   So they're really cutting it tight
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.520]   They are
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.720]   Charging
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:11.120]   It will have it will come which moto x did not with the quick charger that was a 30 or $40 extra on the moto x
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.400]   It will come with a 32 20 milliamp hour battery. That's about 400 milliamps hours
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:24.720]   More than the moto x dual front facing speakers 32 or 64 gigabytes a snapdragon 805 also better than the moto x
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.200]   13 megapixel rear camera
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.680]   I mean in every respect
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.440]   It's a slap in the face to anybody who bought a moto x because for the same price had we waited a month
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.480]   But it's the same specs as the one plus
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.040]   What's the battery size of one plus?
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.080]   I should have a question. I don't remember. I think you're right. I think it's very close
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.520]   And the 13 megapixel camera is the same
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.240]   You don't have dual facing speakers. You don't have cheap charging
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.160]   It's similar and I think frankly if you have a plus and you're happy with it
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.840]   100 stay with the plus 3100 all right 31 this is 32 20 it's more
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.400]   But wow one difference is the screen. This is the the new screen is ultra as I said ultra hd or
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.160]   What the actual power hog is that that could be a big difference?
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.760]   It could mean that the bigger battery gives you less battery up. You know we have to wait and see
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.240]   Supposedly lollipop is also an improvement in battery
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.200]   Auduby yeah
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.920]   What is the resolution of the of the new screen
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.400]   1440 by 2560 so it's 1440 instead of 1080 yeah that's uh the pbi is
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.320]   493
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.160]   I thought it was over 500. It's a lot
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.600]   Well, that's what they say on the website is at 5.9 point
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.680]   5.96 inches. Oh, so it's not six. It's not my perfectly six
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.320]   Yes, how's it at now? How do you feel?
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:49.440]   It's 0.04 inches away
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   For being six inches
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.720]   That's just a longer figure nails quad hd
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:03.600]   You know that's really I mean anything more than 300 pixels per inch is probably invisible at a normal unless you're really
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.640]   near sighted size. Yeah
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.760]   493 pixels per inch is pretty amazing
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.680]   And the the six plus is 5.5 inches right
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   This isn't
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:23.200]   0.4 inches bigger than then the six plus the six plus the iPhone six plus
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.600]   The iPhone I forgot about that
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.440]   You've got the iPhone screen is exact is identical to the one plus screen in fact. I think it's the same part
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.400]   So it's five and a half inches. You have an iPhone six plus screen in your hand
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:42.320]   Right. Is that what makes it so difficult to get scale on the one plus because they can't get supply it is now my theory
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.720]   That that's exactly what's been happening that apple has been taking every one of these screens
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.080]   And so what all one plus can do is whenever they get a batch of screens they put out more invites
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.280]   Interesting. That's my that's my new theory. We should try to get one of those one plus guys on on the show
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.840]   Yeah, it's fine because you know what all three of us
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.240]   With all three of us have settled on the one plus one as the phone to have
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.120]   Let's take a break when we come back. I want to talk about the update that we got on one plus one
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:15.520]   Which we which actually puts it over the top now as the without question king of the android phones in my opinion
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.920]   And there are there's some real rivals to this the lgg three
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.880]   I mean there's some tough rivals and we'll have to see when the when the next is six comes out, but
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:29.280]   For now, I think we can declare a king of the hill
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.800]   Hey a brand new sponsor want to welcome mandrill
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.720]   To this week in google and it's just a coinky dink, but it turns out that jina uses it
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.840]   I do I do my company think of uses mandrill to send all of our email and we love it
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.480]   I'm so thrilled that they're a sponsor mandrill is
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.840]   Scalable reliable
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.080]   secure email infrastructure
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.640]   Trusted by more than 300,000 customers. It's the back end for mailchimp
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:04.240]   That we determined that uh, and I have I've been recommending mailchimp for years for our consumer users
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   particularly on the radio show
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.360]   But this is like the heavy duty back end for it
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:15.440]   Fast you can integrate deliver and track and analyze everything
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:21.840]   Stats amazing. They've just got this literally I copied and pasted that code into my app and it was working. It's great
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.320]   So you okay, so let me understand it better. I'm glad you're um here because
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.800]   So this is uh like a mail server
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.440]   Yeah, it's it's it's a it's a huge farm of mail servers in the sky and you basically there's a there's an awesome
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:45.120]   API it's just a very simple rest api and you say hey send this email use this template
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.800]   You can it helps you you design your html templates to make your mail look the way they want
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.560]   And uh, and it sends it so you could use it for mailing lists
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.000]   But you put it in your app as a way for the app to have email capability
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.720]   Exactly exactly. So so on think up, you know
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.960]   You can opt into a daily email with your think up insights and that and mandrel sends that
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.280]   Um, so you know in your app you say yes, I want email and then when our crawler runs
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:12.480]   It says does this user want email? Yes, and it boom it pings pings mandrel and that email comes through them
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:19.040]   You send them a template to mandrel from your mail chip account or you can code your own import it with they have an api rest api
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.680]   They have a template editor in mandrel
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.800]   real-time notifications

[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.680]   Which is very high to like very low after we did a redesign of one of our emails
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:35:01.200]   And we realized that the reason why is because we found out there mandrel and then we found out the reason why is because the email was getting shuttled into gmell's

[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.160]   I've used mail ship for years and I know it and recommend it, but uh, I
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:07.680]   This was the mandrel name was new to me. So here is a great website. Thank you to our chatroom comparing screen sizes
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:13.120]   Of all of the big phones the nexus five is on the left then the moto x new
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.640]   2014 one it's always felt a little squatty to me now I see why there's the lgg3 right next to it
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   That's a uhd screen
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.880]   Our one plus one is kind of the one in the middle one that says never settle
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.360]   Samsung galaxy note four i my note four is coming should be here by next week
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:36.080]   I'll have a review of you for you of that on before you buy next tuesday. Yeah, there's the iphone six plus
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:41.040]   See iphone's bigger because of the bezel see and I think that's a mistake apple made
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.520]   But they have a physical home button and so does samson
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.240]   I am now no longer a fan of the physical home button remember how much I bitched
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.120]   Yeah
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.680]   I was so wrong you were right
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.520]   Google said no we want you to do on screen buttons actually
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.680]   I I like capacitive buttons. I never liked the physical button that much
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.240]   Because I feel like that's something that's gonna break
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.680]   Both the s5 and the six plus have it because they use fingerprint readers
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:14.480]   Or the note right yeah, the only advantage to the physical buttons is that like you can you can tell what and
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.400]   Which way your phone is turned right like by looking at it and touching it
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.640]   Like I find that I right on android phones that are just these flat black slabs
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.120]   That I search on the sides for the power button
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.600]   Part of the reason why I love the one plus one is you can just tap the screen to wake it up and i don't have to search for the power button
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:35.120]   Right, um, but that's the only thing that about the about physical buttons that that I that I miss
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.560]   I mean otherwise I think it's just it's it's it's a much nicer design and it the software can be what this offer is
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:45.760]   You know without without a physical button. Yeah feels primitive you won me over you totally won me over
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.080]   Uh, and i'm not looking forward to playing within the fork is that that physical button?
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:57.200]   It you know, okay even and it's a simple thing, but i'm trying to use my phone surreptitiously in bed
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.400]   And the you know, I tell you way too much about my life don't I?
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   I
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.320]   Is it surp vicious because you're working when you should be trying to sleep or is it?
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.520]   Or am and i'm trying to
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.320]   Yeah, but I click the button and you can hear it go click
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.600]   I mean if it's dead silent you can hear it. I obviously not normally, but that's just I want to just
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.560]   Um
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.560]   There at the far right
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.160]   Is the nexus six it is the biggest
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.000]   It's shamu all right. I wish they had a 15 20 in here
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:37.440]   Because the 15 20 which is the six inch lumea is just as big it's the nice thin phone though. I really like
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.600]   Uh
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.360]   A gray icon with this website. You could just uh, kill one of the phones
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.080]   Um and then add the 15 20 can I put a 15?
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:51.120]   Yeah, hit the x above one of this there's a weird pop up above it, but yeah, I don't need an x is five anymore
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.760]   Let's uh put the uh, how do I add this is a cool site? I've never seen this site
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.720]   Uh, where do I add it here? Oh here it is
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.360]   Uh, lumea
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.200]   One here. I've added it. Oh, you're so good. Mm. See it's it's it's that big
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.680]   It's that big baby. Yeah, wow
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.000]   um
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.720]   And yeah, I mean some of this is hard to tell because you're not holding it
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.400]   The thinness of the body has a lot to do with how big you feel it's gonna be
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:28.480]   The nexus six dwarfs the sixth the iPhone six plus like it really there's so much more screen going on there
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.600]   I mean, it's only happening right because of no bezels
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:38.000]   No bezels baby. I didn't realize how big the bezel was on the on the iPhone. Yeah, bezels is bad
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.960]   That button that thing's gotta be a monster in person though. I can't wait
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.360]   Plus is i'm buying it right away
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.400]   It's nice that the nexus six is actually six inches, uh versus, you know, yeah
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:56.720]   Six plus being five five, you know that the numbers line up by that that there's something about that makes me very happy as a coder
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.520]   I'm very there. I'm a little person. Yeah
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:06.560]   I think it costs a lot of cognitive dissonance that the the iPhone six plus is 5.5 inches
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:12.800]   Well, that's what that's what they said. You know the the joke is oh the iPhone six must have been designed by a man
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.360]   It's five and a half inches, but they called it six plus
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.720]   That was carol wasn't it
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.320]   I think that was carol swisher probably carol lovely
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.600]   You're a son
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.160]   Yeah
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.120]   That's good
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.080]   October 29th we can pre-order that looking forward to it
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.960]   Can we can we talk about the new android ads real quick?
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.080]   We talked about the plan all that android, but let's play just one
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.840]   I find that this this whole the tagline and the new thing the marketing campaign is very interesting
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:51.040]   I think they're smart because I think that they're playing up the fact that there's choice in the android
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.880]   The turning that into a feature instead of a bug right?
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.680]   Yeah, you call it fragmentation. We call it choice right exactly
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.200]   But they communicate that very very effectively this time around
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:09.520]   In these particular particular set of promotions. I think has been have been really landed. Oh, sorry chat has it
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.440]   Hey, I have I have one. Oh, there's a few different ads which is a few different one
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.120]   Play all three of them so I can go to the bathroom. Okay sounds great
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.440]   Let's start with the bus stop. Oh, yeah, I like the bus stop
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.240]   This is the best one because this tells you something remember this is before we saw the nexus six
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:35.280]   Hmm
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.280]   Hmm
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:53.520]   That is good
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.520]   Oh
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.520]   Oh
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   I hadn't seen that one
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:45.120]   Yes in grave music together not the same so that's um an interesting
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:51.040]   What was that create your own and draw and droidify? What was that? Yeah, that's from androidify all of the all of these are in
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:59.360]   Dritify characters right? Oh, that was the website where you create yeah, android
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:05.520]   Be together so let's uh oh yeah this one this one is the this is the the tear drug
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.520]   Okay, over to your table where you didn't
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.800]   If you did that was a cool move
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:16.560]   That was an ant move and moves and guns, but they can mean everything
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:23.440]   Their hand moves to put wings on a bicycle now we fly when enough people have an end view
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:26.240]   the world changes forever
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.440]   You think that's a little better because of an ant move it's their think different
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.200]   Okay, this is it. Yeah, that's great
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.160]   Because let's go something new something self-driving car. That's why we need this
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.960]   That's the ALS ice bucket valent and them
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:50.560]   Robots graduation you've self-esteem this right now because everyone doing the same thing won't move us forward putting underpants
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.800]   Together
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.560]   Wow
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   How much they're gonna spend on this campaign?
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.480]   This is uh hundreds of millions of dollars. You're gonna see this on a super long
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.880]   Android before
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.160]   Well cool spot ads before but it was been we for search
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.320]   Wondering this last night, you know, like I've seen chrome ads on tv
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.720]   But are we gonna see android ads on kiwi like I can't I can't think of any mobile operating system
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.200]   That's ever had its own ad that was that it wasn't focused on a phone. There's never been an iOS ad
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   There's gonna be a windows phone ad right, but we've seen windows phone on the hcc
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.040]   M8 and we've seen the iphone ad right like it's it's it's so I wonder I was wondering last night
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:39.200]   You know are these videos targeted toward developers? This is what google's way of saying frack? This isn't fragmentation. This is choice
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.640]   Um, no, I think it also is is what kind of phone you have an android phone you hear people say that
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.560]   um
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.880]   But google's never really branded it heavily and and and google made up the model that stuff
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.400]   You couldn't have that separation before is if you had a blackberry operating system
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.360]   You had a blackberry phone period full stop. You've got a no key operating system
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.720]   You had no key a phone full stop. It was it was open android that changed this new model and they never really branded it
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:08.320]   Well, I also should point out that while previous nexus phones are clearly developer phones
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.840]   Google realized with the success of the nexus five. Maybe there's a market this nexus six is priced like
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.920]   uh
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.360]   Phone phone. This is a price to make money. This is a product
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:26.000]   Google's definitely selling this not as a develop right. It's not developer platform anymore. This is a product
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.960]   Yeah, I mean they're calling it their reference device
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.120]   In the blog post they said, you know
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.960]   We understand that you can't innovate in software if you don't do it hand-in-hand with hardware
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.400]   And that's why we're continuing our nexus. They made a very strong state declaration
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.560]   We're continuing our nexus line and we're doing so through the nexus six and the nexus nine
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.880]   Um, I don't know. I mean our consumers
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.600]   I mean there's there's a big benefit to buying the nexus six unlocked for that very high price
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.280]   It's unlocked and you can use the carrier that you want and you get pure android. I just don't know
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.800]   Get on all the carriers. It's on verizon. It's on atnt. It's on sprint. It's on t-mobile
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:04.320]   They didn't do that before this is a diff. This is a product for them that they want to make money
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.880]   Pricing also a way to suck up to the phone companies
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.920]   We're okay. We're we're gonna stop making you look bad
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.800]   Uh, we're gonna go along with the game
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:17.680]   We're gonna charge seven hundred dollars for a phone so that you can have your factor ridiculous made up business models
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.800]   I think they're gonna I think what they're doing is they're selling the nexus five
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   Continuing to sell an x is five because there's a low cost developer phone
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.200]   If you're a developer, do you really want a six inch screen? Doesn't that really
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.760]   Limp. I mean
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.280]   Really? Do I mean you're developing more than that Leo. I think I think the pricing
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:42.800]   Shamed the phone companies and shamed both of them. I agree because it told people but so does one plus one
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.520]   But but now it's not google doing it one plus one shaming it is a different matter. You can't get them
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:54.720]   Google shaming them is a big deal. So is goo is this i'm just asking is this google caving in to the maybe
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.720]   They've given it to the carriers. They've given it to the carriers. So maybe
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.960]   I'll be honest as a developer. I want to see my app looks like on a six inch device
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.320]   Yes, because well because there's a tablet layout and there's a phone layout
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.840]   And this is between is right between them, right? So first
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.520]   Has and has andre gonna render
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.480]   You know, and was it gonna be the tablet the tablet layout or the phone layout?
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:22.080]   And I want to see what that look that looks like it could look like the phone layout to spread out or it could look like the tablet layout to
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:27.440]   To actually it's not of course the screen size is the resolution that you care about
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.480]   Is there an advice with this? Yes, there are
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:37.760]   Many devices with this 1440 resolution, but they're tablets that they're tablets. Yeah, this is the tablet layout
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:43.680]   Yeah, this it's got to be the tablet layout, right? Well, we're they did they just drop the stk or they're going to I mean
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:49.280]   There's going to be simulators that that will show you what this looks like. You don't have to buy a redo vice that you've been developed for
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.920]   But I am certainly interested to see
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:56.720]   What it what it looks like and you know, and I also probably should do some material design updating
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:03.840]   So as we all should we'll do this quickly because I know most people don't have a one plus one and it's still tricky to get one although
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:10.640]   Invitations are becoming much are flowing much more freely now. Yeah, uh than they used to
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:19.680]   Um the cyanogen mod is you know, we've been saying for a long time. We prefer vanilla google, right? We want the google play experience
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.600]   Yeah, so i'm curious gina because you were the biggest proponent of it
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:29.520]   Yeah, what do you I mean cyanogen mod is an adjustment just as touchways and sense are
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.840]   It is it is
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:38.400]   I love it. I love it because it gives it gives me extra functionality, but I will say that some of the extra functionality
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.160]   does
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.280]   Border on a little extra geeky and a little bit bolted on
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:50.080]   Yeah, like I I'm okay with that because I I know kind of know what i'm doing
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:56.400]   But I there's part of me that also feels like maybe for like a regular person the pure pure android the google experience
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:02.400]   I shouldn't say pure android the google experience android might might be just as good if better. I mean the things that cyanogen gives me
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:08.720]   Are very fine grain controls that like nerds like me care about but probably not everyone cares
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:13.520]   I don't know. I want to hear your argument. Perfect example here is the quick settings, right?
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.920]   So before you see the system settings the first thing you see when you slide down on the right is the quick settings
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.960]   on stock android you can't modify these on cyanogen you can
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.840]   And there's a much richer set of choices
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.560]   available for you
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.040]   That's that is great
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.760]   And makes perfect sense
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:42.400]   And yet it's still very much the this it's just a small addition to what is essentially the google experience
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:49.120]   Similarly when you go and and oh and this is also there this quick bar, which is not part of the google experience. Let me go back
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.840]   When you go into settings it'll be very familiar anybody who's used
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:59.920]   A google play experience phone. I'm like a Samsung experience, right? You don't have four different tabs
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.280]   But they have a few things for instance. This is nice. You can choose
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.720]   I can't actually maybe this is now in the google experience. I can't remember can choosing the home the launcher
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.000]   Um, I like the ability to choose the launcher
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.080]   Um, there's themes which you don't have obviously in google play edition
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.640]   Uh, and there's a theme store so you can
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.400]   Changes dramatically if you don't want to use the holo theme, which is basically and i'm sure there'll be an L theme
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.640]   um
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.000]   Gestures you've saw me do the v to turn on the flashlight
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.200]   Gina loves the fact that once you've locked the phone
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:39.680]   Or turned off the phone. You just double tap it to wake up the screen. Yeah, that's really awesome. It's a little thing
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.600]   Uh, and I bet you there's a third party app that'll give you that capability
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   It's little things like that, but it essentially
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.080]   feels pretty much
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:53.280]   Oh, oh, and i'll tell you here's the biggest difference is these capacitive buttons are weird. So it's home
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.080]   I can't even see them. They're so damn
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:02.400]   The menu home and menu. I mean google doesn't want you to have a menu button that might be the most controversial thing on the one plus
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.240]   This is this would normally be back and recent
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.360]   Uh, and on the on the one plus it's
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.160]   menu home and back
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.360]   So that's
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:19.760]   Right, and i'm running the google now launcher. So I get you I can switch between I get wallpapers and widgets and settings when I tap that
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.320]   So it's it's different. It's you can customize it
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.720]   Um, you can customize it a lot
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:31.920]   And I love that and and customization is a huge part of android and one of the biggest selling category one of the biggest selling categories of apps
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.920]   I think only behind games
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.960]   Uh, which is in the case for for iOS. I just don't I just don't know
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:42.160]   I mean look google's google's got to create the experience that that makes sense for most users
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:47.680]   And I just don't know if most users care enough about their phone to rearrange, you know, the titles here
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.360]   like
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.000]   I mean listen
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.320]   This is this is the line that you always have to walk and consider when you're making any kind of software, right?
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.320]   Like there's so many different levels of users
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.560]   Cyanogen mona has always been aimed at at this sophisticated user, right? Absolutely
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.360]   Which is why we like it completely agree that cyanogen is is way better
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:11.200]   I didn't want to have to deal with doing it myself. I love that this phone shipped with cyanogen on it
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.440]   And I was just like, okay, this is fresh clean. I know I'm getting updates through with the matter of action
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.320]   I don't want to deal with any of that that BS. I don't have enough time in my life anymore
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.760]   Unfortunately, but but so but I love that I can buy a phone with cyanogen on it
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.400]   Um, and and I yeah, I love it. I do love it
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.920]   And now they've added the cyanogen camera saves camera raw
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:33.840]   Uh, now that's a 16 from this phone. It's a 16 megabyte file. So every time I take a picture
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.920]   I use up almost 20 megabytes and you can't read the camera raw
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:43.360]   With anything you have to import it to light room to read it, but it's a dng format
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:48.000]   Which is a stammery format. They've also added high res music capability, which I think is great
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.960]   I can now play back flak files recorded at 192 kilohertz
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.200]   24-bit sound
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.840]   That's the pono players doing that the new sony walkman does that we're moving in that direction
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.840]   I think the htc might do that
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.400]   Um, where the ability to play high quality, uh, really high quality music back
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:16.000]   So when does lollipop come out uh for uh, android when is it when is it likely to come out on
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.640]   Sandogen they didn't say did they
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.720]   When do like to come out on sand it like when are we gonna get oh?
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.280]   See how much later right because they have to then it's gonna
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.240]   They have to get the source code and then they have to modify the source code
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:33.600]   Yeah, they basically have to rebase their work on top of lollipop. Yeah, yeah, it's it's gonna be
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.040]   Probably a while
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   They're defined a while
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.960]   Months
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.960]   I think it's coming months. Yeah, I
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.720]   Yeah, I would be surprised if it happened before january first, but
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:51.280]   It depends on when the source code drops and how long you know those guys are here
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.040]   They're at google's mercy. They cannot do anything until they've released the source code
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:00.080]   Yeah, in fact and I thought you were asking about lollipop on the nexus six and stuff and it well
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.080]   I guess it'll come out when in nexus
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.640]   Advice with the l comes out
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.160]   Um and google has been releasing the source code
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.680]   Closer of the faster so that's good for us
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.760]   I think
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:18.400]   You're gonna you're gonna make june and phil jellis that you have all been immediately get an x6 and probably move to it
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:23.840]   But because it I presume it's gonna have the other things that I like about the moto x like they always listening and all that stuff
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:28.800]   I don't know does it. I don't know it's a road road or a product. So I would guess
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.840]   They put it on the droids
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.840]   The max and the turbo will have it
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.480]   Oppo has a big motor oil logo in the back, right? Yeah
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.680]   Yeah
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:44.080]   I can use it with my hint and my moto 360
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:49.200]   So I tried to get the head I threw it
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.120]   Sagan I tried to go out and get the lgr and
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.480]   Failed that new watch with the bezel
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:02.640]   Right. Sorry. Yes, and so it's it's a real round with no flat tire and it's out here in korea for I think
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:09.680]   $30 equivalent with korean tax, but I asked at the front desk the hotel and four thick guys. No, no, it's already sold out
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:15.040]   And and it's weird. There's no best buy of korea you go to these big electronic markets and there's just
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.280]   Booze after booze after booze after booze after booze
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.280]   People selling stuff for the people making computers there and all kinds of odd things
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:26.560]   I can't figure out where to go where I would go to get it. I tried all yes to have noon fail
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:32.640]   So I am very happy with the moto 360 and I don't notice a flight. Do you is a flat tire still bother you?
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.000]   No
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.480]   I stopped saying it doesn't bother me at all. I I I have to say this convinced me
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.680]   This is the first device I've used that convinced me that wearables might have a future
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.200]   Yeah, yep, it's a great device. Yeah

[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:38.880]   The trumpets because we got the change now
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:42.320]   The google change log
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:50.320]   Here's jina japanese with the ladies from google
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:59.280]   Google launched a new hangouts app for chrome on windows and chrome os only so sad sad panda here because i'm on my mac
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:04.880]   I wasn't able to try it out. Uh, but this is basically a chrome packaged app. So it works outside of the browser
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:11.360]   Um, so it's separate from the hangouts chrome extension that you may be using already. This is outside the browser
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:17.840]   Um, and it displays in a separate window your contact list and your chats in one window and you get notifications
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:23.760]   Of course that alert you to new messages and chats of course with all hangouts sync across all your devices
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.400]   Um, it's got calling on the desktop now
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:33.360]   So it has all of hangouts video and voice functionality so you can make phone calls to any number in the world via the hangouts dialer from from your desktop
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:41.120]   And the app includes complete google voice support so you can make and receive calls and get your voicemails and sms messages directly and hangout
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.200]   So when you uh
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:48.160]   Go to the you get to get this if you're on chrome windows or chrome os go to the chrome web store
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:53.280]   And you can download this separate this separate app separate from the original chrome extension
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:59.040]   And uh, it'll it'll put itself in chrome's app launcher and you'll see the you'll see the new window
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.200]   And it gives you kind of like chat head style
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.280]   Almost access to your contacts and chats that are going on so
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:12.480]   I was gonna use it today, but I thought I would I installed it then on install because I figured I did one another variable being korea at five in the morning
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.960]   I
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:21.600]   I couldn't figure out was a little green thing. I couldn't get it to go away
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.880]   So it's just always there on top of whatever you're working like oh, that's annoying
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.680]   Yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be a setting somewhere to get rid of it, but I didn't take the time to whoa
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.800]   Whoa drag it around
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.680]   Look at that action, but it's always there, but you can put it anywhere you want
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.440]   You know, it's like the chat heads. It's like facebook's chat heads. Yes. I hate that
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.240]   I hate it. I hate chat heads
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.600]   Oh
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.440]   But you kind of do want it to be persistent because I have to say even on the mac I'm always
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.640]   You know like digging around for the hangouts window. It's got to borrow the top. You got to borrow in the bottom use them
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.320]   Well, but if you click the chrome extension for hangouts
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:08.080]   On my mac because I have multiple screens and multiple works work areas spaces spaces
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.920]   Uh, I don't know where it is. I have to search because it pops up. Yeah
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.560]   It signs me to the wrong google account
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.280]   Oh
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:22.240]   Jarvis Ian rant comes on all I want to accept the text message you guys all I want to do is
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:31.040]   I think they think they've fixed that problem, but they haven't because that now you can in fact on chrome o s you can sign into both
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.440]   accounts
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.440]   And without having to sign into two completely different sessions good so I can switch right
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:43.520]   Well, that sounds okay, but that's not the point folks the point is I want to go tab to tab and be using different accounts
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.160]   I don't want to have to change my
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.160]   entire view just because my
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.280]   Google plus is different from my gmail. So it doesn't really help a b
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.240]   My chrome was crashing as never before so I I stopped it. Oh and it has a
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.840]   Since not
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.600]   I think it's still
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.200]   There's a there's a point in software development and I know because I've gotten there many times where there's a giant bug that you've been
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:13.280]   Wrestling with for you know months and maybe sometimes years and you convince yourself that it is fixed
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:19.920]   Your own sanity and I think I think maybe google's gotten that point like fixed enough
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.800]   It works
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.480]   I like the hook
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.680]   It's you know the thing is it works perfectly on android
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:33.280]   I can go into any android application go back and forth smoothly between users
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   um
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:41.040]   Perfectly be a little stretch, but I thought closer if he got it to android quality in chrome you'd be okay, but you're not there
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.240]   Yeah, yeah
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.040]   Yeah
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.840]   Well, because the real problem is if I click on the link to google plus from in my gmail
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:54.080]   If that opens it in the wrong account and I can't get the link over that's that's that's just one fix that and then you're all the right
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.240]   Cracked but enough of Jarvis's rant
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.520]   Continue on by the way
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:04.640]   This is the compromised lollipop. It's a lemon meringue flavored lollipop
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.640]   Oh double l
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:18.240]   I'm a lollipop licking is getting obscene who did this by the way one of my our staff decided to put lollipops all over my table
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.360]   Was this Burke?
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.160]   This is amazing feels like a Burke or was it you Chad?
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:27.840]   And this seems like a Jeffism if if I've never heard of one needles it wasn't needles
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.080]   Carson and Tanya Carson and Tanya is what it was here
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.320]   Whoever gave me about eight thousand look at this one. What do you do with this?
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.040]   I want one. I'm gonna look at it
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:43.200]   You know what they'd use this as an excuse to go over to power will sweet shop and stock up
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.160]   on the good chip lollipop it's short trip to the
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:53.920]   We represent the lollipop
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.400]   There you go
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.400]   lollipop league
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.680]   All right
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.680]   More
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.760]   Let me keep going with the change all of you can save this
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:11.040]   Okay change a lot continuing chrome for iOS now downloads and saves files and supported applications
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.400]   So google's updated chrome for iOS. It's got better support for the iphone six and six plus
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:23.040]   And now thanks to the new nis that ios has it's kind of similar to the oldest that android had ha ha ha
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:29.200]   When you run into a downloadable file when you're browsing a browsing you can download it and then send it over
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.480]   To a supported application so you can download something on your phone
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:38.480]   On ios and send it over to drop docs or google drive for example, which is which is a nice nice upgrade
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:46.560]   Chrome 39 beta for android is now rolling out with reader mode and a couple couple other little features
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.040]   Um, this is coming out to users on google play you have to be opted into the chrome beta
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.560]   Which which is available, but please do have some tolerance for some bugs
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.520]   Although i do use it as my primary browser so i recommend that if you got some of that tolerance
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.600]   Um, it's got some performance improvements bug fixes other tweaks
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.760]   Google doesn't usually announce new features in the in the beta version, but
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.400]   There's users have noticed a couple of new things
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.840]   There's a new reader mode that kind of strips away the ui elements of chrome to let the user focus
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.160]   Only on the text of the web page
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.160]   And also in this release
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.560]   Is this still experimental windowed mode accessible only on the android l preview
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.760]   This is this when each web each tab in chrome actually looks like its own individual
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.040]   App when you're flipping through your recent recent apps or switching between processes so chrome itself isn't a process
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.440]   But each web pages so that's kind of nice chrome that the chrome 39 beta for android
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:47.440]   Uh latest google glass updates does notification sync a lot like android where it does
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.240]   Uh, so basically this means glass gets the same
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.840]   Functionality as the android where smart smartwatch is meaning that any notification that you get on your phone
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.960]   You'll be able to see on your on your glass
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.160]   I think this makes a lot of sense that glass and android where is kind of syncing on android where i'm going to run it
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.800]   Basically be running the same software that'll be running on your wrist
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:13.440]   Uh that update is due to hit glass this week and you'll have to be running the latest version of the my glass android app
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.640]   That's version 3.30 and that that will be coming out today
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.280]   Finally and thanks for this one jeff i didn't i hadn't seen this one but it's really neat
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:27.920]   Uh google released a new chrome extension for google maps that lets you that turns your default
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.520]   New tab page into a random satellite image
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:38.080]   From earth google floor so every time you open up a new tab you get this sort of gorgeous satellite image
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:43.120]   It's called earth view from google maps. So search the chrome web store for earth view from google maps
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.520]   And you know i i download and install this i thought it was a little gimmicky
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:52.000]   I thought that it was slow slow things down and be kind of annoying it's awesome. I love it
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:59.280]   Um, I hit command t all the time to open a new tab and it loads a random earth image and tells you where it is
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.960]   Uh, and it's just really really neat really cool customization for chrome
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:10.000]   Uh, so that's free and that's also from google. Let me try it. Oh, that's so cool. Yeah, did you get it? Oh, yeah, that's so cool
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.160]   Yeah, look at that. Look at that. This is like the new backgrounds in crone on the crumb cast which are also very cool
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.880]   I'm just gonna keep hitting drill T
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.880]   Yeah, I know right
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.880]   I got some of these
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.720]   These are great
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.720]   Obviously there's a tree where it is
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.480]   Yeah, this is australia. Tell for
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:33.120]   You can see it's on the lower right hand corner because uh, yeah, this green is a right in the way
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.840]   st mary and antiga and barbuda

[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.480]   That must be fun really though. That must be amazing
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.960]   Sargentina
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:57.040]   Yeah, this is this is neat and it's it loads so fast, right? How do they well that's yeah? I hate I don't want to know how they're doing it
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.960]   It's probably something I don't want to know
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:05.520]   Don't feel is like locally cashed. I feel yeah, it does doesn't it
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:13.360]   Right like a restart. Yeah, it must be locally cashed. It's gotta be right. Leo. This isn't these are like high res images
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.920]   Yeah, our sargent. It's not this fast. Yeah. Yeah, these are locally cashed
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.200]   By the way, I'm not like 800 tabs
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:28.240]   Wow, and I haven't seen a repeated one yet. This is so cool
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:36.880]   You've just wasted the rest of my day. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, the problem with this is that you forget what you open a new tab
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.480]   Because you're not you're now planning a new the next vacation. Look at that. Wow, it's beautiful
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.960]   These have to be up. That's a repeat
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.600]   Got a repeat repeat
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.840]   Oh, these are repeats. No, I'm going backwards now. Oh, you're back with
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:58.240]   Oh whoops went too far
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:04.320]   That's all I got and that's the google changelog
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:11.280]   And the name of the lollipop cubed
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:15.600]   We'd like to record welcome you to android l
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.080]   They should have done that
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.240]   I missed a bet
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.400]   Okay
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.400]   You mentioned the negotiations that would have had to have heard
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:34.720]   Who owns the way by the way, it's so funny because I said lollipop league at first
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.640]   Right and of course the chat room went crazy and I was like no, it's kids. It's kids, but you got to write skills
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.080]   Guild
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.920]   I'm glad I didn't correct. I knew it was killed and I thought no that can't be right must be league
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.160]   But it's the lullaby league
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.280]   And the lollipop guilds them when we got that straight
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.680]   Holy moly, it sounds like a show title to me. Yeah, the lollipop killed
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.200]   We'd like to welcome you to and roidell
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:07.920]   Uh, so the answer is in the chatroom sus this
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.160]   Amazon, but you have to understand why eric schmidt says
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.920]   Google's biggest competition is amazon. He's speaking to europe
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.880]   It's a speech he gave
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.800]   um
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:27.920]   In berlin earlier today. I don't know why jeff wasn't there. It seems like I don't know anybody is in berlin jeff should be welcoming them
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.960]   Uh
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.720]   He wanted to make very clear that google has competition because there's some you know, I think in in europe they're filled
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.200]   They people feel like they're a monopoly and they're evil
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:45.040]   He says that we have a lot of competition
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:52.960]   Uh all over the world and I you know a lot some people suggested by do the chinese search engine. Absolutely
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.760]   um, let me find the amazon
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.760]   part
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.800]   Says if you're looking to bot let's see if you want the google is not a monopoly people believe it is because
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.880]   If you want the news you're likely go to straight to your favorite news service build
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.200]   the most wavy red newspaper in europe gets 70 percent of his traffic directly
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.840]   A little over 10 percent of their traffic comes from search end just under 10 percent comes from social sites like facebook and twitter
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:25.040]   If you're looking to buy something perhaps a tent for camping you might go to google or being or yahoo or quant the new french search engine
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:31.360]   Nice little plug there aric, but more likely you'll directly to zalando or amazon
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.360]   Last year almost a third of people looking to buy something started on
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.480]   Amazon that's more than twice the number who went to
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.400]   google
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.200]   So he's got a good point google search is not just going and searching nowadays
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.360]   He says our biggest search competitor is amazon people don't think of amazon as search
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.960]   But if you're looking for something to buy you're more often than not looking for it on amazon
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.600]   And a google killer is almost inevitable
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.000]   somewhere
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.520]   Someone in a garage is gunning for us says eric, man. I know
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.560]   Because not long ago we were in that garage change comes from where you least expected
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.880]   And that's google won't do what google does just as google didn't do what a ol did
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.480]   Inventions are always dynamic and they're resulting upheavals should make us
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.600]   Confident that the future won't be static little self-serving
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.320]   You know it's clear who the intended but it's true
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:31.280]   I've written it is a about the German problem. I'm trying to place in a certain German newspaper. They're taking forever to get back to me
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.440]   um
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.920]   We shall say I mean it's not wrong
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.200]   Oh, no, no not at all
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.880]   Uh, ireland is finally considering closing the tax loophole that have made google and apple
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.600]   uh cash rich in europe
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:53.920]   Uh, they remember that's the job of government to do that not the job of the company is to take advantage of it
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:00.640]   And and it's a fine thing that they do it. It's how they powered the irish miracle. I would guess is low corporate tax rates and
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.200]   Yeah, you know
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.600]   Companies took advantage of it. Well the tax rates gonna stay low
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:12.800]   The difference is that you could and i'm gonna get this messed up, but you could take certain assets and attribute them to a
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.360]   um irish subsidiary
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:21.840]   Then somewhere else that had no taxes so thus permuter. It's the so-called double irish. Yes
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.960]   Um
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.440]   So we'll see. I mean it is true that
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:31.920]   Google to take advantage of this created double in headquarters
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:38.400]   It's uh the biggest google office outside the us with one of 2,500 people a double in base subsidiary for google
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:44.080]   Generates revenue mostly from online advertising then pays that money in royalties
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.960]   To a separate google unit that's registered in ireland, but is resident in vermuda
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.920]   Adobe and yahoo and apple all do the same thing
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.480]   Uh
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.840]   The truth is the irish miracle kind of is a bust right? I mean it uh ireland did very well and grew very fast
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.960]   But has now uh slumped a little bit. I think
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:12.560]   And of course, there's a lot of pressure from the us and elsewhere the european commission too
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.880]   Uh
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.960]   To change their tax. That's how this should happen should happen through lawmakers and diplomats
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:22.720]   Starbucks has a starbucks uses the netherlands
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.080]   The double Dutch right the double Dutch
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.160]   Wow
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.480]   All right
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.120]   So i'm sure google's got its attorneys looking for a new loophole as does everybody else
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.920]   Google has removed 490. Oh, this might be a number
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.200]   No, it's not we kind of did the last week anyway. So yeah, all right
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:48.160]   498 000 urls have been removed under european law
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:55.520]   Actually 498 000 urls were requested it's be removed a little bit less than half 41.8
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.000]   were removed
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.880]   And now tokyo wants to do the same thing a japanese man spreads that's the problem with this
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:06.880]   this spreads so the right to be forgotten is now spread of japan and the
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.120]   the
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:16.880]   Blaistung schutzricht has spread to become the spanish link tax and these games are dangerous. You're going to have to learn some japanese jeff
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.360]   tokyo district court on thursday issued an injunction ordering google to remove
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.440]   Some internet search results about a japanese man that are considered to be
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.160]   violating his privacy
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:34.320]   He felt well, and maybe this is legit he felt that his life was endangered
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.760]   By the results that came up when his name was entered in a google search
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:46.960]   So, you know, they've been kind of closed mouth about what the actual circumstances were because to protect his privacy
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.680]   So it's hard for us to judge that google's chromecast is number one
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.720]   At 35 bucks i'm not surprised the number one connected
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.400]   device
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   According to report from apani which is pretty reliable. We've trusted them before they analyze the top apps associated
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.680]   With connected devices on itunes and google play
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:14.080]   the chromecast app number one in downloads followed by fitbit direct tv hp print codec
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:20.800]   square register go pro atnt universe universe dish anywhere and hp's all in one printer remote
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:27.840]   Cartner group says there will be 26 billion connected devices globally by 2020
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:35.840]   So the fitbit comes behind the chromecast interesting chromecast number one then fitbit then direct tv by
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.880]   this is quite an assortment of
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:45.840]   Devices here you've got health tracker the streamer the square register i'm surprised that there's more register registers out there
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.240]   Then go pro's although the register is free
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.640]   Go pro app is free once you have a go pro but the dongles free. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.280]   Right, right
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.920]   So the chromecast is 35 fitbits 99 I think I guess that makes sense
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.680]   This is feel a little bit like gapple star and just though
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.480]   Did you see the um we talked about this on windows weekly and I'm not I made fun of it
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.120]   but microsoft research has uh
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.800]   released an app
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.880]   That will fit you type on your moto
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.240]   360 or other android where watch it's a little bit
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.480]   It's so newton. It's so newton. It's it solves a problem that you don't have
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.680]   Uh, I guess they forgot that we could just talk to the watch
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.280]   But now when somebody asks you do you want to do lunch you can say s
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.640]   Oh
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   you
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.640]   N d
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.120]   s
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.120]   e
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.160]   Are you good?
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.240]   At just say k
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.960]   Yeah, what the kids say
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.640]   It felt like the story was supposed to be that mrs was
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:03.040]   Collaborate not collaborating with google but developing on android, but the real story is why would anybody want this?
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.520]   Well, but it is okay, okay
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:08.880]   And then you know it actually is it's not easily installed and blah blah blah
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.800]   But I think it is kind of interesting that microsoft is even
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:19.200]   Doing something for an android watch that's kind of what press. Yes. This is the new microsoft research
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.280]   Which is you know, it's a really cool part of microsoft that kind of does their own thing
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.880]   Um, but it didn't feel like that was the story, but then it was like why what is this?
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.440]   And I feels like google could make that app right?
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.960]   I mean google's got that the handwriting recognition and translate already
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.400]   It just it seemed like just a very weird
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.440]   Yeah
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:42.000]   Typing into a google search box you say okay google
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.640]   Yeah, it's like they know
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.160]   I saw they maybe didn't know how to use the android wear or something and
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:54.560]   Yeah, well, that's another story though is that is that is that old people don't like talking to search
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.440]   So
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.840]   Officially old because I
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   Like to imagine old people doing that
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.560]   Do young people like to talk to search? Yeah, this uh this study. That's fine. This
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:13.600]   Was said yes, I did. Oh, you're young. I guess I love talking into search
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:20.320]   It's it's so much faster. Yeah, it uh, I don't have to so do you do it in your phone or you do it
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:27.040]   Do you do it in your desktop both both you'll I'll be lounging in a chair in the most stupid young kid position
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:33.040]   Hurting my back. I'm sure unable to reach the keyboard and all you have to do is is say
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   I asked my modo x what time it is
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.120]   Maybe that's an old person thing. Yeah, I'm never done ever done. I didn't even know that was possible
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.120]   Make a modo x what time is it?
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.080]   Then it tells me
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.200]   the new uh the new tesla
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:56.640]   All-wheel drive like that the model d also reads highway speed signs
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.360]   and i don't believe
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.880]   What
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.640]   To read this lines or does it have date? I have a database of no no
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:14.320]   Speeds it has a camera in fact, uh tesla's uh, ceo elon musk and founder was laughing at how google cars google autonomous vehicles work
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:20.400]   He said it's silly because you know the lydar has to be you have to map the neighborhood before you can drive it and stuff
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.320]   so uh
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.320]   Tesla's starting to look into
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.400]   the idea of actually
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.400]   the reading signs
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.400]   I
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:33.280]   so also, uh, this I will never use
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:40.080]   uh on the d uh using a system of 12 sensors around the car when you press this turn signal
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.200]   It then looks at the traffic
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:50.400]   Checks your blind spot and then actually changes lanes. I tried you go like this and go it's all yours
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.720]   Would you do that?
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.400]   Autopilot whatever it's called on
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.000]   most cars
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.240]   Many not most many cars forward has the bliss system will will warn you if there's somebody in your blind spot
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.040]   That's good my car blinks and
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:14.080]   Uh, but the idea that the car you would just all you have to do is flip the is in signaling your intent to change lanes
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.080]   And the car would actually do it
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.120]   That seems a little scary
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:23.120]   Yeah, it's a slippery slope of automation, but you'll love it over bridges jeff
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.840]   Very rarely leaps over the edge
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.320]   Do I do I have a
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:35.440]   Teens embrace voice search
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.920]   Yeah, that's weird
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:41.520]   So so so jeff's car would have to administer a sedative and then do
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:46.880]   You'll have to when you get in the car have a little iv that you insert
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.960]   And then you just sit there and it'll sit it'll just it'll come it'll smooth the ragged edges. Yeah
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.240]   Yeah, don't worry you idiot. Nobody falls off bridges. What kind of fool are you?
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:04.320]   45% of us adults say they feel like a geek talking to their phones
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:10.080]   That sounds about right. Yeah, yeah for uh, but
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:16.400]   Less so of course when they're younger 55% of those under 18 use voice search daily
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:21.920]   75% for those who are on their phones 11 or more hours a day
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.080]   What could you put 11 hours on your phone?
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:30.880]   Second is that even possible? I mean kids today
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:34.960]   Chad explain yes when it's your computer. Yeah
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:38.080]   Well, I do notice
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:45.360]   All the time I just they walk there walk around they there's no if you're weighed anything. It's always
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.480]   You're in a constant text conversation. Yep
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:55.040]   Even if there are people standing there you would prefer to type at somebody who is distant then talk to the person with you
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.880]   Kids today
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:06.960]   40% of under 18 use voice search tasks for directions actually I use that all the time
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:12.880]   Navigate to I use that all the time 39% dictate text messages with voice. I do that
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.320]   I'll both on my modo x and on my modo 360
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:21.280]   In fact, I very frequently dictate texts. I just it's too much trouble to type
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:26.400]   32 initiate phone calls. It's funny. That's lower. That's the lowest number
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:33.760]   With voice call they don't call that's why it feels so arcane. Anyway, you have to go use the dialer call
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.880]   50% of north easterners
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.840]   north easterners. What what is this?
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:46.080]   It this is what it says 50% of north easterners use voice search at least once a day
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:51.200]   I wonder what north easterner is north easterner
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:57.120]   I know because it's cold and you got gloves on
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.080]   Okay
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.920]   Okay
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.920]   Survey asked respondents pick something
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:08.000]   I feel like Richard Dawson
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.200]   Pick something you wish you could ask your phone to do for you
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.120]   45 said send me a pizza
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:22.960]   Now isn't it so interesting isn't a pizza delivery app the first thing that Larry and Sergey worked on together?
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.400]   Very good
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.200]   Like to place up in order for pizza through the web
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.320]   They weren't those those are larry and Sergey or was it
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:37.360]   Who was it some founders? They wanted they had a pizza fax service. Oops. Oh, sorry
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.080]   It was like pizza by fax. I thought it was a fax
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:44.800]   So I don't have to talk to anyone when I get my pizza. I would
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:49.440]   By far I thought maybe it was a elixir so haney and uh
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:57.520]   No, no, no, no, he's nearly a site that allowed users to order pizza through a fax machine
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:04.800]   So it's amazing to me that they're still building the pizza by fax. They're still doing it. This is from his ex
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.760]   Zaul for ex talk
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:12.960]   About moonshots here and I've had the opportunity work. Um, yeah, we don't watch all this
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:18.880]   And sometimes the order would be faxed to the pizza shop. No phone call would be required
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.440]   No phone call required
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:25.520]   I don't want to talk to my dirty pizza guy. I just want him to send me the pie
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.120]   Actually, I ordered pizza all the time over the web now
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:32.240]   Whether there's a petaluma food taxi, it's called
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:35.040]   But there's others there other services
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.040]   I
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:42.080]   Domino's I don't normally use but when I I've been known to when I'm late and they're barely it's the last place
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.360]   It's gonna be open. Yeah verbs where I live the domino's app
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.280]   I have a standard thing in there. Get what button on the phone and it's pretty awesome
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.560]   I wouldn't eat domino's pizza if I were you
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:57.520]   Strange thing, but when you're when it's 10 to 10 and you're desperate
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:03.600]   Yeah, yeah, I had to be really desperate to eat domino's pizza. Oh, you snob
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.600]   Yeah, I'm gonna be told a snob. Yeah, I gotta tell you guys ever since I move back to brooklyn after eight years of missing good pizza
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.840]   You got good pizza. I'm really
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:17.520]   I pick it up. You don't live in the boonies like I do. Where is the pizza? Where's your favorite pizza in brooklyn?
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.440]   My favorite pizza joint is recently opened. It's called fina pizza bar. It's on fort hamilton
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:30.480]   In windows terrace. It's delicious. It just opened the guy literally he had that he had the oven shipped from italy. It was stuck in customs
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:36.240]   It's the pizza delicious. It's it's kind of fancy. It's fancy pizza. I don't understand because
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.720]   How can the best pizza in brooklyn be just opened?
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:46.560]   Okay, well, there's many there's much best by the way. They don't seem to have a website
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.160]   I
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:53.040]   Let me plug mine so I keep it open because it's my break up in pizza
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.160]   Where I am a Lombardi's pizza company in martinsville, New Jersey
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.480]   That sounds more like good pizza Lombardi's bibardi's pizza company
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.280]   Hey started with a truck and now they've got a brick oven in the in the place of his first. I like the brick oven
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.880]   Yeah, that brick oven is good. No, it's true
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.760]   I know you're right. You know what they don't have a website. They don't have a website is so weird
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:16.080]   It's so they have twitter and instagram though
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.760]   Um, but you know, there's great pizza author brooklyn. I mean really, you know

[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.680]   No, it's so funny
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:39.680]   One of the the cable guy came to my door and he wanted to switch me to like I I was on um
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.560]   Comcast he wanted to switch me at 18t or something like that
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:47.600]   And he's doing the whole pitch the sales pitch until he gets to saw him on tv do you watch?
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:54.240]   Zero none none. You got you and he's like well you got a tv right? It was like I I moved in I haven't plugged it in

[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:02.080]   And he walked away. It was like the family
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:04.800]   To get rid of the guy trying to sell you a
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.520]   So you cable

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.720]   So if you go to my google plus it's plus dot google dot com
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:17.760]   Slash plus gina tripani you can see that i've got the latest android arena
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:21.840]   Poll posted there and you can vote on it and you can see how polls work
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:24.640]   What's really nice about these polls is that when you re-share them
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.120]   The votes don't get forked
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:30.800]   So like right now on google plus if you re-share somebody's post the comment threads get forked
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.880]   You know like your share will have a separate
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:38.240]   Current original post on on the polls the votes that the numbers all you know, they're all the same
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.560]   Right, so if I re-share it, I have the same numbers
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:45.680]   Yeah, which is really really nice and of course all the votes have a names attached to them and google plus accounts attached to them
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:48.000]   Which helps deal with you know
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.880]   Scripts that try to you know dupe the stats or whatever
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:57.120]   So yeah, really really nicely done and cool cool way to use polls
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:02.880]   So we we have some really good apps in the arena last night too, so uh, I know who's winning. Yeah, so
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.680]   Well, we didn't attach names to what they are
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:08.800]   But but mine is winning
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.560]   So i'm pretty i'm pretty happy about it
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.960]   We've already gotten a huge response much bigger response to this poll than we do on our normal
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.520]   Our regular straw poll app so pretty pretty happy with this so I like it a lot better
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:23.120]   And it's in of course in the in the social community, which is really and i've been using it
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:28.800]   I used it because I took pictures with my one plus my iPhone and
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:33.760]   I can't remember what the other phone wasn't gonna ask people to give me a
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:40.960]   Rating on which phone they thought was the best and I got 2,242 votes, which I don't think I would have gotten anywhere else
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.240]   Wow. Yeah, so that's really good. Um
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:47.920]   Yeah, that's a tremendous response and an unusual response
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:55.200]   The Moto X1 and then the one plus one and the five phone six the the laggard in the bunch which kind of surprises me
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:00.400]   Uh, well it is google plus I guess you know, that's uh
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:08.240]   Maybe maybe part of the reason one plus was really winning for a while and then people people uh
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.200]   voted chimed in for the moto x
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:17.440]   Um and again lots of comments too on it was really this poll is nice is that yeah
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:21.120]   Yeah, people can vote but then they can also discuss which is which is nice really like that
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.960]   I'm gonna use more of that more as well. Yeah
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:27.840]   Polls now in hand now in a google plus jeff jarvis your number of the week
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.160]   Well, um
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.480]   combination year so google has announced it's gonna bring the same day delivery now to uh
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:40.080]   Boston dc in chicago with manhattan and la following and here's the interesting thing
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.960]   They have their own version of prime
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:47.200]   $95 a year for its same day delivery
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.560]   Speaking of competing with amazon. This is goo
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.040]   This is google shopping express
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.880]   I remember trying this out of manhattan
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:04.960]   They have like a trial period there for a while and it was great. It doesn't work in brooklyn and then they said brooklyn was to come
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:09.440]   Yeah, this is literally do that. Yeah, that's really interesting
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.320]   Is really that's real. It's like in amazon
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:17.120]   We don't have that in petaluma. Obviously it has to be a metro area. I guess
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:21.920]   Uh, that's neat the the the choices were a little bit
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:26.400]   I should say a lot more limited than I mean it was a big big crime anywhere
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.160]   But same day means that you have to have a depot, you know, you have to have a place to draw
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:32.320]   They don't bring it to your house. Do they?
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:37.520]   Or do they? I think I think if you live if you live them in hatton they would bring it to your house. Wow
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:42.160]   But the difference models here is I think that you know amazon has its own
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.840]   fulfillment
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:48.080]   Google fulfills out of existing right brands ebay
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.680]   um
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:53.440]   wants to enable small stores to do the same thing eventually
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.480]   So it's really the shopping express rebranded
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.680]   But they're not delivering stuff from the google store play store
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.720]   Because that would be kind of limited. This is from the third party
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:07.440]   Partners right like their drivers going around and assembling or order a target and bringing it to you. Yeah
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.640]   So by the way, the other number is it's it's seven o'clock. So it's dawn in korea. Look at that. Wow
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:19.040]   That's beautiful. It is can you see kim jong eel from there?
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.960]   Oh
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:27.840]   It'll be a travesty eel eels under the ground. It is news here. What he no one's seeing kim jong on either
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:31.040]   I might point out
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.760]   He was seeing yesterday and it makes news here lord knows yeah, where was he seen
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:38.720]   hobbling somewhere yeah
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:46.400]   Well, he's alive anyway going to get some mac and cheese perhaps so I owe an apology to one of our uh stall wart chatters who asked me about
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.800]   80 times yesterday to install a program called system panel and I said no, I don't like task managers
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.800]   I don't think they're a good idea
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:02.480]   But I finally gave in there two versions. This is the free version system panel light and they also have a dollar 99
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:05.760]   uh pro version which might be
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:08.400]   right
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:13.120]   Right. Sorry. Go ahead. No, it's sort of the bright greens. Yeah, it is right, but what it does is really
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:17.760]   Actually kind of useful useful. I don't recommend this is not a task killer
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:23.520]   We know that that's not recommended anymore and you don't need one of those and a lot of times programs like this will
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:30.400]   Chew up battery life. So this is really more a diagnostic tool for those times when you're wondering what's running in the background
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:35.920]   What's eating the CPU? What's eating my battery and you can get very granular information
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:40.560]   Which you can get somewhat from the app manager, but in a much nicer format
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:46.880]   from this system panel it's called and uh, this is a plot over and by the way it does history
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:51.200]   So you can see what's been using the cpu over the last week or month or whatever
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.000]   Uh very handy if something is eating your battery life for instance
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.520]   I mean one of the problems with the battery monitors is it'll you know
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.960]   Most of the time tell you well say android services, but what does that mean really?
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.360]   What is it that's really using the battery life?
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:13.120]   So I can see which applications are active on my one plus but which applications also are running in the background as services
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:18.560]   And I can see over time which is using how much memory how much cpu how much battery life
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:25.200]   Uh, it's really I wouldn't say something you want to have all the time running, but as a diagnostic tool
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:28.560]   Uh very handy. I was surprised to see that for instance
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:33.520]   Even though I've never even launched it once the amazon kindle app was running all the time in the background
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:38.720]   On my phone. So I just uninstalled it actually uninstalled a half dozen apps that I don't use like glimpse
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:43.920]   But that seemed to be using cpu and memory all the time on my phone. So
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.920]   Uh, there's a free light version the the pro version has some interesting things that you can for instance
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:53.440]   Uh pack up applications uninstall them and reinstall them
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   Uh in one lump
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.880]   But some interesting additional features. It's called system panel
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:08.960]   One word system panel app and the tax task manager from next app and I don't remember the name of the chatter who was asking
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:16.320]   Me about it, but thank you for push pushing through $2.99. Not $1.00 $2.99
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:19.280]   Uh, that's it for this week in google for this week
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.520]   Thank you so much jeff javas for taking the time to join us from korea

[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:00.000]   Wow
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.280]   That's not that seem to be planning for something. Yeah, that's not ominous at all
