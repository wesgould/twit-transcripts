[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   Up early with me this morning

[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.180]   Yes, thank you for doing it to see you again - hello again
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.340]   It's really nice to have you and Mike Elgin and we did a special which is available now on our feed
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.200]   We'll talk a little bit about what Samsung announced because it is Android focused
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.900]   Also here Jeff Jarvis couldn't do it without him professor of University of City University of New York of journalism
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.960]   He is at buzz machine commas where he blogs
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.400]   It's great to have you again Jeff and we brought in Gina's partner a Neil -
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.720]   Hello everybody so nice to have a Neil here if you're not familiar with a Neil you ought to be
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.060]   He's been involved in the community for so long. I mean use it your tweets
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.320]   Often are the conversations you have on Twitter are so important so valuable
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.680]   I became aware of Neil when he was an evangelist for six apart, right?
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.120]   Yeah, I'm like a decade ago. Is it been that long almost? Thanks
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.640]   Where else have you been? Oh
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.000]   A bunch of stuff I was in the music biz for a while and newspaper biz for a while
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.200]   And then of course the last several years has been working with Gina on think-up and that has been super exciting and fun
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.040]   really neat so are you the founder and CEO what is your co-founder with with Gina and
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.240]   Yeah, and we you know we started the project as sort of an open source thing we were doing when we were working in a nonprofit
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.320]   And it's just snowballed and grown. I think
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.800]   Twink folks especially probably know a little bit about think oh yeah
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.840]   It's been really really fun to kind of watch everybody jump on board and I think just the last month
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.840]   I feel like we've done the best
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.640]   But new features and exciting stuff around it. So that's been the most fun
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.360]   I've had on working on this even for the past couple years
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.120]   and of course
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.680]   Neil's well known as a blogger at dashes.com right yeah
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.480]   Yeah, and I've been contributing at medium and used to write for Wired sometime. So a lot of different places
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.400]   Yeah, go ahead. Jaz the free sampling led to growth
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.280]   Yeah, yeah, I think it's been it's been it's one of those things where you sort of cross your fingers and you hope that you're talking
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.760]   To the right people that are gonna understand what you're making when you make a new product
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.720]   And I think fortunately you talk to like you know the toy audience and they're actually curious and interested
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.000]   So yeah, oh yeah, it's nice. So what's the story with his Prince blog post from last month from July?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.780]   I wanted to ask you what is going on you have a very long blog post. Yeah, so I'm a fan of Prince
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.120]   I haven't really anybody who likes music right yeah, and
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.760]   But I almost never write about them
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.640]   So I think all my friends that are really you know like oh you're a huge fan and he does something and they sort of say
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.440]   Oh, you're gonna write about it and I never pretty much never do and
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.480]   Last month and I'll apologize in advance for all of us that are gonna feel the pain of this statement last month was the 30th anniversary
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.560]   Of purple rain. Oh my god. Yeah
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.360]   30th anniversary Wow. Yes. Yes 30 years and so I thought what would be something fun to do
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.600]   About the anniversary and everybody would sort of do it was a big album
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   It sold a lot of tickets as a movie
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.360]   fairly obvious things and
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.520]   What I did instead was because this is I'm okay technology. I'm pretty good at Prince
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.080]   Secret power is Prince
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.600]   I wrote about how the the song purple rain came together and it was basically
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.920]   You know a good five ten years of Prince's career
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.000]   I sort of yeah
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.240]   I come together in this thing and it had it all the members of the band contribute to it and what were the the aspects of
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.880]   I actually cut some stuff out that was about how the
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.200]   Housing policy and zoning regulations in Minneapolis at the time influenced
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.160]   The song being created other than that pretty much everything else is in there that could possibly shape the song
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.920]   And it was one of those like I've been meaning to write this for about 20 years
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.120]   So let me get it out there and the response has been great for from music nerds
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.280]   It's been really nice and then for everybody else they sort of politely distanced
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.240]   Oh, no, I was and it reminded me of Wendy and Lisa who I hadn't thought about in
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.840]   30 years sure when he will be celebrating her 50th birthday this year. Yeah, but they're fantastic
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.720]   They still around are they still yeah, so they do a music composition. They got a like a special
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.080]   I want to say special Emmy this year for oh good
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.000]   I composed for much TV series so they're they're great
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.720]   They're really active on Twitter and Facebook and like really just sort of smart and engaging fans
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.480]   Oh, I'm glad to see that I'll have to find him on the Facebook now that I'm a big Facebook fan
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.280]   so
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.920]   Robert Scoble came in he had been saying
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:39.560]   Challenging me saying you're doing it wrong Facebook. He literally said Facebook is gonna be it in a year
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.360]   You'll come back to me say oh you are absolutely right. There is no other social network. Nothing else matters Facebook's number
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.720]   Number one I said you're crazy. I mean Google+ is so much better. He said that's because you're doing it wrong
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.520]   So in Sunday he came in and we recorded an hour and you know what we were gonna release it as a triangulation layer this month
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.160]   But there's been so much interest. I think we've got to move that up
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.760]   It's people really want to see this he showed me how to go through Facebook how to categorize everybody
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.720]   How to you know give Facebook? It turns out if you are a
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:18.240]   Siduous about giving Facebook signals about what you want Facebook that he says it's artificial intelligence. There's a lot of you know
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.000]   Smart software behind Facebook to give you what you want if you just give it enough signals and
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.960]   So I did that I'm still not sure if I'm getting a
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:36.640]   Great experience, but I'm giving it a try. I'm very bold Robert Scowal prediction that Facebook will be a popular social network
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.120]   It is kind of bold. I mean I keep waiting for Facebook to go away
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:49.620]   He convinced me to put Facebook back on my mobile device and messenger. I don't know any place you get a billion people showing up
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.620]   It's probably not going away anytime soon
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.360]   No, I guess yeah, there's that network effect
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.640]   I don't know anyway, well, it's still just as goofy as it was to me in fact
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.040]   The saddest thing is that Google+ is getting more like Facebook not less and that's I don't like it
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.440]   I've decided I'm gonna do and I've registered the domain names of and I think this is what we the world needs is a
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.600]   verified social network on a poll Google can't do it because of
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:24.200]   The tying the Google services into this real personality, but anybody else could where you have to send me a driver's license picture
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.320]   And today's newspaper and and and I can damn demonstrably prove it to you
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.160]   And this is gonna be a verified social network wouldn't that solve all our problems with Twitter?
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.640]   Especially Jeff, what do you think I already read verify dot zone? I
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   Know a lot of a holes by name
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Yeah
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.520]   Yeah, but don't you think that if somebody if you do know who they are that really tempers that conversation a little bit
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.360]   Yeah, I mean I've been thinking about our talk last week
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:03.520]   the show does that and and the idea that we're acting as if we're in crowded space what in fact we're in this wide open space and
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.960]   And you know you look at Twitter and say oh my god, I've got to talk to those people
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.360]   Well, it's not actually that many people right who actually see the tweets
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.320]   And so okay, you can announce things there and do things there, but the world doesn't doesn't demand that you're there
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.080]   We know that now. Thanks to Twitter analytics. How few people see our tweets. Yeah
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.520]   So I'm not sure it's worth all the hub up and hoo-ha
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:32.920]   You know I remain troubled by by the places that come up with with difficult people and difficult behavior
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.680]   And I think that's one of the way you're trying to answer
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.440]   And I don't know whether identity is it maybe maybe it's
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.040]   Gina had the kernel of it as is her her habit
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.160]   Maybe it's more about sharing signals about people who are nice people and people who are acting nice
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.480]   I mean I had a case where somebody we all love
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.720]   retweeted a
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.240]   Anti-twit troll
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.320]   who trawled
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.760]   Me into his tune in that that's how I noticed and this person we love had retweeted it or it responded or something
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.760]   I said that's it that's a twit troll
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:17.600]   You're feeding them and our friends said oh oh okay. Oh great. Thanks for telling me and you know I killed the the reference
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:24.800]   And so I think that in a society you kind of band together in ways so I think you're on to something
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   personally which is
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:34.120]   You want to know who someone is but I think there's another thing which is to get clever about how we recommend people to each other
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.080]   And what that matters and and and there's got to be friction. There's got to be the loss
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.080]   Which is what my kelvin's point was you have to be able to to lose some value by acting like an a-hole
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:51.240]   Well, there were some a-holes out there this week. This was the week that
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.520]   pictures of a great number of Hollywood celebrities were leaked apparently hackers
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:06.640]   Got into their accounts we think of the best thinking right now Apple said there's no structural flaw with iCloud or
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.120]   find my iPhone
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.360]   These were targeted attacks and the best thinking is that there was in fact we know there was a flaw in
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.760]   Find my iPhone that allowed
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:27.280]   Unlimited brute force style attacks password attacks. It wasn't what we call rate limited in other words most sites if you enter a
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:34.840]   Password and it's wrong it tells you but it limits the number of times you could do that or it slows the process down
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:40.140]   It makes it difficult to do a high-speed brute force attack find my iPhone was not one of those
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:46.320]   That by the way flaw was fixed on Monday after these photos were released
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.120]   So the best guests of many including Jonathan Jadarski is that
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:59.040]   This brute force attack was used to get the passwords of these celebrities and that their iPhone or iPad backups
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.880]   Which were stored on iCloud were then grabbed and it was there that the photos came from that's a little scary because
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.920]   That means other information lots of information was also grabbed in those backups
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:19.360]   The photos posted on 4chan most of the most sites including reddit responded in an end image or responded pretty well
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.040]   Even the Perez Hilton after initially posting images
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.080]   Realized what a mistake that was pulled it down and apologized and said that in the heat of the moment
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.560]   I posted that but that wasn't a good thing so in some ways which is which is a really important moment
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.600]   I think yes
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:41.960]   The beginnings of norms being agreed upon here now. It's weird to me that we gathered around nude celebrities not around
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.600]   Beheaded journalist similar thing happened with the preheaded journalist. I think it was a one-two punch wasn't it?
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.920]   Yeah, I think yes, I think that's a good point. Yes. I'll buy that and the second time that this had beheading videos went up
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.400]   They were not nearly as widespread were they?
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.960]   That's true. That's true
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.600]   I feel like
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:08.760]   We're getting to some level of norms on this and that includes the technology services if it gets sufficiently egregious
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.160]   Reasonable people go whoa wait a minute. Let's just hold on here
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.720]   right right and
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:22.600]   And you know what it would be wrong to even look in both cases
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:29.000]   So it's not just about being wrong to post them not be wrong just to spread them. It's also wrong just to look I
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.440]   Think yeah, so there's an interesting thing here where people make jokes about
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:42.120]   Nudes leaking right and there's this sort of fake distance one pretending as if every attractive 20 something
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.280]   You're all doesn't have nude pictures somewhere and
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.480]   Two is even some of us older uglier fellas do right right right right right
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   My team I lay out
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.840]   I
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:06.520]   Jokes aside to an approximation everybody has some normal behavior and there's nothing wrong with it
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.480]   There's nothing wrong with it. It's totally normal and then
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   You know, so there's at least a push back against the sort of joking or I have a right to see it or whatever
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.680]   And that's really good
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:22.680]   And then the second step the deeper conversation especially in you know our context what we're talking about tech is what were the defaults?
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:29.080]   What were the choices the platform made and you look at in the case of apple assuming that you know apple is obviously a big player in this
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.720]   For most of these images, um, you know what apple does with your thumbprint is
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:40.200]   This really deeply secure designed to never let it off your device really smart
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.000]   Decision about what the default thing it does when it can scan your thumbprint
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.480]   It's treated like important private data
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.960]   And the contrast to the default for iCloud being accessible too fast or off not being encouraged
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.920]   Uh that you know the rate limiting bug that you described a whole series of choices
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.280]   Five six seven ten of them that all could have gone the other way that would have had an impact here
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.120]   And they haven't felt the pain of that and I think it's interesting because this is happening
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.640]   Right before their big announcements next week one of which we know
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:18.840]   You know from the developer conference is going to be about please upload all your photos into the the photo roll and icloud by default
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.400]   Uh with ios 8
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.120]   And and that's going to be a real challenge for them because their whole
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:30.040]   Value is simplicity ease of use, you know user experience and cool factor
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.640]   And all of that is being threatened by them having made frankly the wrong choices about their defaults and security
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.480]   And it's false is another way in the other way i agree and to say policies
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.480]   And so twitter had a policy prior previously of trying their best not to
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:51.080]   Delete accounts and when it came to uh both the beheading and the slab photos they started bleeding accounts
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.240]   And i'm okay with that
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.040]   But now that forces twitter to say well, what is your policy? Where are your lines? What are your limits?
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.640]   Where aren't they
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.240]   And you're forced to have policies now which platforms that much like Emily bell wrote in the guardian that
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.760]   Pathology companies aren't accountable and i disagree with that strongly i think that they're highly accountable
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:18.280]   But they've got to recognize that they have to document that accountability i think apple's going to suffer a big blow from this
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:25.560]   Uh, cloud is going to suffer because of the stupidity of the press making this a cloud issue right wasn't a cloud issue
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:31.880]   Well, it was okay, but to be fair if you put uh something on the internet there is a risk i've said this for a long time
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.880]   Uh that it could go public by accident or by flaw
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:42.520]   So you should be kind of aware of that apple's default was to upload those i suspect that the people whose pictures were revealed
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:49.800]   Did not even know that they were being uploaded the cloud anybody who has pictures like that probably exerts a little bit of caution about how they get
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:58.120]   Distributed, um, but you could do everything right you could follow the defaults listen apple saying it's secure if you do this
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:05.880]   You could even do what apple said and enable two factor authentication, which i think you know, maybe the four of us there two factor sucks
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:12.600]   I'm it's terrible right but you could do all those things right and still be vulnerable because of the choices apple made
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.760]   And they could have been different. It's not obviously if something's online connected
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.720]   Ultimately somebody can crack it but we're talking about reasonable defaults reasonable security
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.480]   Uh being less vulnerable to brute force attack and apples made bad choices here and should be held accountable for it
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.760]   There's nothing wrong with us but i mean especially if you have this kind of platform put some pressure on the and to say okay
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.160]   Now there's hundreds of millions of people that all have at least something incriminating
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.200]   What about the notion that uh, maybe apple should modify its camera program as should every
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.480]   Company modify the camera program. So there's a switch just as there is on your browser that this is now
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.040]   Going to be private browsing. This is going to be private photos. Please make sure that these are
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.760]   Uh stored more secure idea
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.640]   Yeah, that would help there's a there's a ton of ways to
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.280]   Look at the real the real solution
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.840]   And google's done quite a bit towards this in gmail is and an encryption
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:11.480]   Uh trust no one encryption that before my stuff. There's nothing wrong with putting stuff on the cloud if only i can decrypt it
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.880]   Right
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.280]   Uh and apple needs to give us that tool specifically
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.560]   Yeah, theoretically if you can make the experience good enough
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.640]   Well, there well and this is the problem apple has a huge investment in this notion of it just works this thing about magic
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.800]   And they and this is one of the reasons they're sick. There's two factors so poor
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.800]   Uh, is that they and then why they still use security questions, which by the way they implicated in this hack
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.440]   Uh, is the thumbprint
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:48.280]   Thumbprint secure some kind of works. Yeah, and and it never leaves your device remember apple has we were pretty sure because there's
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:55.240]   Unnumb numerous stories about this apple on tuesday will announce that they have deals with master card visa and american express
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.360]   Nordstrom and others to do payments
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.960]   If using those services on your iphone presumably using touch id in past book
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.520]   Um, are people gonna think twice now about using this is a huge blow to apple
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.160]   This is couldn't have been timed more poorly
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.960]   From their point. Yeah, hope so
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.640]   I don't think apple i think it's i think it's kind of hurt google as well
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.520]   Well, uh as we talked about on windows weekly google and microsoft should step forward and say
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.320]   Unlike apple if you turn on our second factor you cannot without this
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:33.800]   Second factor id you cannot get any of your data from our cloud you can with apple
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.240]   That's part of the problem is that you don't need to factor to get the iCloud back
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.920]   Yeah, well, how can how can second factor jina you talked about this a little bit how can second factor be made easier
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:50.600]   So that so that people will just therefore the default people would not complain and they'd adopt it and and we would be in
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.920]   What does it need?
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.400]   Yeah, I mean that that's a really good question if I had the answer
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.440]   I might not be sitting here right now. I never really I paying job at one of these companies
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:07.800]   Well, you lose it we've talked about this on security now when when you do end end trust no one encryption
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:13.080]   You lose some of the capabilities people want the ability to go look at your data on multiple devices for instance
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.480]   um
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.880]   The ability to dedupe and stuff like that those things say goodbye for shifting from an iPhone to an android or vice versa
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:27.880]   Right no cloud's gonna let you do that if it's all encrypted. So, you know, we'll get to it next quarter next year
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:34.600]   So you can something like last passes is multi platform and does end to end encryption, right?
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:39.560]   Like I saw my I can decrypt locally on where we have last pass installed which is across multiple devices
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.760]   Um, that's it's it's possible
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.960]   That's a good point. It is possible. I mean last pass is great software. We use it all the time
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.160]   It's very reliable. It's also probably the most
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:59.000]   Challenging user experience of any app I use regularly really and and maybe just because it's always there's always something that feels like a pain
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.920]   Security is a challenge. You know, that's not last pass. That's called security
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:08.040]   And that's exactly why apple has been so reluctant I think to do the completely secure thing
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.400]   They want it to just work and that's a trade-off between convenience and security. That's part of the problem
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.760]   the two factors are something you know and something you have and
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.840]   Or something you are there's three possible right right and right and then the biometric something you are and and
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:29.560]   Those things clearly there's a lot of room to innovate around there must be better ways than typing in that code that
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.960]   You know before the timer runs out on your app. Oh, then I do it. Yeah steves doing squirrel
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.480]   Which is a very interesting form of authentication for websites Steve Gibson
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.160]   I mean, I think there are other ways to do this
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:47.000]   But I think that's more interesting than can we make the screen more curved and add one more inch of diagonal
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.040]   Yeah, but don't you think these companies are doing what people are asking them for
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.000]   And what they think will sell and as scurved screen is something that everybody grasps
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.800]   I think I think after this week people will be asking or how do I know that fine? Yeah, yeah, I think it's a real question
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.320]   Uh, we talked about it on mac break weekly. It's my opinion that uh apple has to grasp
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.240]   The nettle and step forward on tuesday and say yes
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:17.720]   We we have always believed in protecting you are you online and we now know we need to do even better
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.400]   And here's one of the odds of us. They that well, yeah, that's not
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.560]   I think they have to say but they could say it. I think they have to grasp the nettle
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.960]   I think it's not a pleasant thing to do but if they don't address it, there's there's going to be
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.840]   Uh, this is everybody knows this happened
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:40.920]   And uh, and not everybody's clear on why it happened. I'm not even clear on why it happened or whether apples at fault apple needs to address this very
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.440]   In very aggressively steve jobs never would okay bets bets around the table
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:51.560]   Bets that they're going to address it in the in a blunt and direct way
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.600]   I say
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.640]   You know their press releases tend to have less bs than most they're a little more direct
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.760]   There's no way they're going to do it on stage at tuesday right to you know, that's what i say about selling their new phone
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.040]   No chance. I think what they do is they let it cool a while
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:14.600]   This is what they did with you know antenna gate and all the other things they let it cool a while that was a mistake with antenna gate that allowed it to blow
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.720]   Yeah, it was
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.600]   Well
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.520]   For better or worse, this is their pattern right?
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.160]   Maybe they changed their pattern, but at least what they do historically
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.680]   They let it cool a while to come back maybe that friday after and they'll all between when they announce it when they ship a new device
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.040]   And say, you know, we hear you loud and clear security matters. Here's what we're doing steps one two and three and x y and z
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.560]   And you know by the time the new phone ships will have this in place
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.200]   You know, maybe they can do that. I think it's actually the biggest challenge they have is
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.720]   Internally they're gonna say it's not a big deal people's passwords got guessed
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.160]   uh, that's that can happen anyone if your password gets hacked and
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:54.040]   You know our guest by somebody and that resistance is of what they have to fight internally is that that that sort of denied denied deny
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.560]   Hope it goes away, right?
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.640]   Which every every big company I I predict that there will be at least an oblique
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.760]   Uh, acknowledgement of this and it wouldn't hurt apple to say
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.720]   We're gonna do better. We're committed to doing better. We are going to protect your data
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.200]   That's their selling point at this point over google
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:17.320]   It has to is that we are we are we are the one place you can put your stuff that's private
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.840]   And if they can't if they can't address that if they don't address that that's a huge advantage. Look at apple
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.320]   The stock price today lost $4.36 almost a 5 drop
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:34.760]   Um go back to google go back to google. What could google do? Why are you saying that this is an opportunity for google to strike
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:42.600]   To say what we know better. We're we're geeks and we I mean this is again that nobody says this in an outright fashion
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.680]   But you make it clear
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.720]   You know, we're the computer scientists. We understand security
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   Much better than apple does and we offer you a secure solution
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   I
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.040]   Do we believe that?
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.760]   Well, I don't it's not whether I don't believe that but I certainly do believe it is a marketing opportunity
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.280]   As leo said, yeah, I mean, I also like I you know, this I'm not to be a cynic
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.760]   I think I'm getting a little sick. So I think maybe I'm just a little down
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.640]   But you know all this has happened before all of this will happen again
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   I mean saying that perez hilton, you know how to you know after thinking about it a little bit
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:21.560]   Had a revelation and took the photos down like this isn't the first celebrity like nude leak or sextape that's ever happened
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:27.400]   And it won't be the last like is perez really or gocker or any of these sites really gonna in the moment of heat to get page views
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:33.240]   Gonna not do that again in the future like I have a hard time believing that you know matt hone and two years ago got got got hacked
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.920]   What was apple's response then? I mean he you know, it wasn't new photos, but his
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:46.680]   They addressed it right and it was a combination of amazon and apple and apple did suspend a password resets over the phone immediately after whatever
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.400]   I just I don't I feel like these things have always happened. They will continue to happen
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.640]   The systems will iterate the companies will make statements, but ultimately, you know
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:02.200]   Like the whole thing is kind of flawed and we all just decide to live with it right because the other option is it's gonna be better
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.280]   It's gonna get better jina
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   because I think the
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.440]   people
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.480]   Are saying uh, you know what this is wrong and I feel a distinct
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.920]   Uh, but remember in these previous releases there wasn't this kind of
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.560]   Uh discussed with it that there is today
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.920]   And I really feel a distinct shift on this. This like this was too much. This is out of control
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.000]   This is wrong
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.920]   Yeah, if we go back to you know and come just gonna respond to what their customers tell them
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.560]   It's ancient history that if you go back to you know the paris hilton sex tape or something which is
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.840]   A decade ago. It was generally greeted with
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.720]   Salacious excitement and exuberant right and it was also sort of people just joking about it
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.360]   And we said poor paris that is sexual assault. That's a crime and that's what people are saying
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:56.600]   It's very different very a very young woman and and all these other things and then I think there's a sort of there's been a change there
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.480]   It's not a heat. I mean, there's obviously still still tons of pigs that are
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.280]   Revelling in this and and you know, not dismissing that but saying that there's there's some shift there
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:10.200]   And then at the tech level I think after matt honen was hacked is when apple introduced it's sort of weak
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:17.400]   Two factor off around itunes. They did it they did sort of put out a statement which at that point was still very rare
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.520]   They weren't just weighing in on things back then but they actually responded amazon made some changes now
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.480]   It is none of these are solutions, but like in terms of moving the ball forward. That's the key
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   It had an impact there's not going to be a fix
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.600]   But I mean jina I don't remember people saying is it right or wrong to look at these?
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.400]   I don't remember anybody saying that it with paris hilton
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.520]   They're saying they're very much is this is the thought you know, it's you shouldn't even you're committing
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.800]   You're you're a cons you're part of the conspiracy. You're part of the the crime to look at these
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.280]   That's a very big shift. Don't you think?
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.480]   It is and you know, I mean I wonder
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:28:00.120]   I mean whatever I think that it's like culturally it's more acceptable to slut shame paris hilton than it is jennifer lard's
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.460]   For whatever reasons in public culture. I think that people
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:07.160]   Nobody's nobody said g poor anthony wiener
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   Yeah, he had agency
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:15.400]   He had agency, but nonetheless shared his photo. It's totally different. Well with another person not publicly
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:21.320]   I mean, I often think it has to do with with a lot of things the people involved. I think matt was a very
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.800]   Um, you know sympathetic character and his situation. I think jennifer lard's is very sympathetic
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.520]   I think that you know, whatever kim kardashian paris hilton
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.680]   They're just like, oh, you know, these dummies who are famous for nothing like they deserved it
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:40.120]   And I think that that definitely plays into it. I do I do look the optimum the optimist in me does want to believe this conversation
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.200]   Evolves every iteration of it, right?
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.560]   But this this will continue to happen and I like to think that I surround myself with folks who you know, we'll we'll
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.360]   Speak up about not saying, you know, not about
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:57.160]   Avoiding victim blaming which is what goes on a lot. It still goes on maybe it's going on less. I hope so
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:03.560]   Uh, but yeah, I mean the whole thing's all things above our but I think we'll look continue to happen and look
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:10.840]   You know, are people really going to demand there's a data breach every few months. It feels like a major data breach at all different companies
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:16.280]   Um, and I just don't know. I've just sort of accepted that that's part of this
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:23.240]   Right, but but jina part of what we have to do is change the rest of the architecture where I mean for pretty nude pictures aside
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:31.160]   About just matters of of of transactional security. Oh my god. They have my credit card number and blank and they can now rob me
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.680]   Well, what's wrong in that picture is that if all you need is a number
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.800]   You know, you can get you years ago. You still get them off carbon copies of of credit card slips
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.360]   That's what we have to change
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:50.840]   So we have to look at a lot of the ways in which a a leak causes harm or causes of vulnerability and come up with solutions from the other side of
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.520]   Yeah, I'm on the board of the data and society research institute, which is uh, dana boids
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.680]   Institute for looking at big data and all the implications it has in society and
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.960]   She'd hosted an event at the white house was doing a report on big data one of the questions was basically about
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:11.960]   um social security numbers when they get leaked and basically you had a room about you know, a hundred uh
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   Experts on big data and then me sort of crashing the party and and they're asking what uh
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:23.560]   What are the odds that 10 million social security numbers get leaked? Let's say in the next decade
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.760]   And you know how many show a hands how many people think that'll happen and basically every hand goes up and say well
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:34.680]   What are the odds? You know how many people think a hundred million social security numbers might get leaked and most of the hands are still up
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:40.200]   So so and then of course credit cards. There is I don't think there's anybody certainly in the united states
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.800]   There's nobody that hasn't gotten that letter saying your credit card number was
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:50.920]   Probably leaked and will you know, you can free enroll in credit protection from us and we'll pay for it whether it was target or
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:58.280]   All these other hacks. So the the universe of like what if can I be secure? It doesn't exist
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.080]   We're all right. So engineers when an eel engineers presume a system is going to be gained
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.760]   This is the way now the data is going to be gained full stop
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.240]   So what we have to change is again, it doesn't address nude photos and theft in that sense
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.640]   Invite that kind of violation, but in terms of the data breaches that you mentioned Dina
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:21.400]   I think we're looking at the wrong way. How do we it's it's it's how do we stop the data from being breached?
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.480]   That horse is running over the horizon and it's halfway australia by now
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.480]   Instead we're going to presume the data will be breached
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.840]   So then where are we vulnerable then and stop that?
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:38.840]   And that's where it goes back to things like how to do transaction does the fingerprint thing do it or other things
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.480]   I don't know. I wish I wish I could write about this with any authority
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.440]   It's the steve gifts since the world we're going to tell us better
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.600]   Well, I now remember why we had an eel on because of his great post on medium about public
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:56.440]   And when you mentioned dana boy that reminded me that you had had a back and forth with dana over sure
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.760]   And I love the conversation and by the way that you all have about that. I appreciate it. Oh good
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.640]   Yeah, I thought very really interesting. We'll talk a little bit about that. We also have a google change log coming up
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.800]   I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.680]   Well, uh jina. Do you feel up to the google change log? I always we have worked you
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.640]   You've been on this is your third show in 24 hours. It's not fair. I know it's been a marathon
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.280]   I don't know. I do it leo. It's really terrible. No one should have to do three shows. Oh, never mind
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.840]   um
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.280]   No one should ever never mind
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:33.800]   Uh, but anyway hang on and hang in there. We're gonna we're gonna wrap this thing up as quickly as we can
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.120]   So you get to go home and I get to go home
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.080]   Our show today brought to you by square space
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.720]   love the square space
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.520]   Um, you know, it's funny because a kneel
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:51.320]   You know, I got to know kneel through the blogging platform type pad and then vox which was a very cool idea
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.960]   And I really missed vox when it when it went away
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:33:00.520]   Um square space in many ways reminds me of that. It's it's the hosting plus the software to make it so easy
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.000]   To create a great website
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.440]   Uh, whether it's a your blog whether it's something an e-commerce site because they've got incredibly commerce
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.960]   If you're a an artist or a photographer your online portfolio
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.240]   Squarespace makes it simple and makes it modern and this is what I really like and I have learned now
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:24.120]   After doing this for a few years that keeping up with the web is a non trivial thing the styles change
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:30.280]   The technologies change the good news is with square space. You don't have to they've got the best engineers
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:36.360]   Working day and night to create modern sites their their current templates are mobile responsive

[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.000]   Uh, they are e-commerce enabled so it's a simple thing to flip the switch
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.240]   In fact, even the eight dollar a month site you can sell something or take donations
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.960]   Um, I just I'm a big fan and of course
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.240]   They realize that the mobile experience is so important

[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:14.280]   Um, they have a logo creator on their website. I love this new one. This is the portfolio app

[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:23.640]   This app pulls your images from your website to create a beautiful online portfolio the kind of thing you would show your
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.120]   clients for instance on your ipad or your iphone so you can go up to a bride
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:34.040]   With the ipad and have a beautiful presentation and not have done anything. It just comes from your website

[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:35.480]   I think you might know what it's called the google change log
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:42.520]   Yes, yeah, just got back from vacation. He's still
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.280]   Still ending the sponsor

[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.080]   I
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:05.640]   Crumbs 64 bit build for windows just got promoted from the canary and dev channels up to the stable channel
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.880]   Which means that if you're running 64 bit windows
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.800]   You can get 64 bit chrome and that means that it's just faster
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:17.320]   And more secure and more stable and can take advantage of all that extra memory space to address
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.080]   Uh, chrome 64 bit on all the other platforms. I know i'm in the beta channel on the mac
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.600]   i'm 64 bit
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.360]   I think this was the last platform maybe to go 64. I believe that I believe that it is. Yes, indeed
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:36.840]   Uh, google rebrands google enterprise with the friendlier name google for work
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:43.320]   Uh, this that's just this week the new name is supposed to be friendlier and more inclusive with small businesses and organizations and even low
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.040]   entrepreneurs and hackers using google services
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:52.200]   Uh, like search and android and cloud platform. Nothing about google enterprise products actually changes is just just the name
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   So it's now google for work
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.240]   Which you know whatever. I don't know how friendly that is
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:03.400]   I mean nothing to you guys but we're moving to leo. I'm reminded of major g cribs
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.640]   Why do you always do the old crap with me?
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:15.320]   Wow tell tell us let's gather around the campfire and hear my scrubs who said who we who
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.400]   Who
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.200]   Do a search jad please do a search for energy. It's like dobe gillis reference, right?
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.480]   Right if you want to search for crabs you have to look on altivistic as it
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:32.040]   Mein and g cribs was uh the character played by
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.480]   mean
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.040]   Character the been a character on dobe gillis played by of course a gilligan
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.720]   No, sis but why don't you just play go?
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.120]   Do you talk like that? I feel like I'm home. I'm sad. Yeah, it's alright, mom
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.280]   I have to go upstairs anyhow start my homework
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:53.000]   Mein and I meant the kind of thing we do at school not the other kind so they kind of work work
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.680]   There we go. All right. That was
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.720]   Sweet for that punchline there. I was like
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:05.640]   I think the problem is jeff that people don't know what enterprise means for a longest time. I didn't know what it meant
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.840]   That's true. That's right. So right, right, you know what you know, leo words from that
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.960]   I sat in business meetings where people talk about enterprise. It's one of those words like fungible
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:18.840]   Yeah, I was embarrassed to ask and I just I just waited until a definition would walk
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.680]   See we got a bde solution here
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:27.480]   We find that the bde c solution has been migrated upward do the bde solution and we now feel the enterprise is the future for this company
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.320]   And I go
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.720]   Enterprise is easy. You just add three zeros to the price
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:38.040]   Enterprise means that you you gave up your dreams of serving consumers
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   I
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   That's a little too close to home
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.800]   I have
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.600]   When I met leo I was selling a product that had just become an enterprise product. Yeah, I
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.160]   They're two friends
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:59.720]   Uh, but yeah, I mean aside from bob denver's least interesting role. There's an interesting thing here with google
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.360]   You had more than two
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.560]   Wow
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.000]   I can't imagine that I think gilligan is clearly the superior. I'm not
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:14.200]   I don't know. I think mayonnaise crebs is kind of a few crabs was a great seminal role. I wasn't I wasn't alive then so i'm guessing
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:19.400]   Um, by the way bob denver looks more and more like bill gates as he ages. I don't know
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.040]   It what exactly is going on here, but this doesn't that look like bill gates now
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.280]   Yeah
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.600]   There's a tech hook for everything for everything. Yes
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:36.280]   But I think that I think the going for enterprise to at work is really a reflection of google apps succeeding in government
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.960]   Succeeding in education, right and all these things are all we're not business
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.640]   We're not because why else would you have this meeting and say look we're gonna rebrand?
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.080]   The most important thing we can do is change the name from enterprise to work
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:53.800]   Um, and it's well where are the dollars and it's they want to put chrome books into schools and they want to put google apps and google docs into
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:59.720]   uh government and and those are the those are the only places that are an objective calling work enterprise
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.480]   Yeah
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.080]   And I was trying to get to a long winded joke there, but I I agree
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.520]   I think I think it makes sense and I think it says that this is ready for prime time
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.720]   It's ready for your office. I I have this much for our equipments my
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.280]   Institution to switch over to google docs and I'd be a lot happier if they did
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.440]   I'm not sure the word change is going to do it
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.720]   But maybe if they believe there's a suite of seats there a suite of
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.760]   Services there that makes sense. All right
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.920]   By the way little little known education go ahead
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:34.360]   Yeah, I think that's why yeah, I think that's why they went work in education
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.360]   I think it they wanted parallelism
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.440]   There's what I think
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.720]   Well, and the URL is still google.com slash enterprise. So I think that kind of tells you most of what you need to know
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.680]   Move on on the change. Well one last dobe gilless fact
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:54.520]   Bob denver received according to imdb 250 in episode for his work as mayor g crips
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.360]   All right moving on
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:12.840]   Google plays beautiful design collection of apps for android just got updated the beautiful design collection it features apps handpicked by google to show off great
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:19.400]   Android ui design today's update includes apps starting to implement ui elements from google's new material design
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.480]   That's coming in android el this fall of course
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:30.520]   New apps in the collection include airbnb do do lingo lumosity spotify runtastic and yahoo news digest
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.160]   So starting to get a peak material design ahead of time from these these apps
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.720]   Um, and finally this is a new one on me apparently it's been a while
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:46.360]   But they're testing some tweaks to it google's testing a new search box inside their search results for certain sites
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.080]   Like amazon the white house or stanford
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:54.840]   So to see an action and I got this for in some of my tries and not all so this might be an experiment that you know
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.560]   Won't work for everyone, but if you search for microsoft say
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:04.600]   Um, you'll see you know the the top result for microsoft with microsoft.com and below that there would be a search box to search
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.880]   Inside microsoft so a site search box in their search results
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.040]   Uh works for stanford works for white house. They all do google site search
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:17.000]   But if you search for amazon and you get the search box it will actually take you to amazon search results
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.160]   So clearly kind of one of these one of google's experiments with you know making the search results more useful
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.840]   Um and interesting to see them pointing to someone else's you know particularly amazon search results as well
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.200]   So it not everybody has it but kind of orders against
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.920]   And I trust complaints if they do that
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:41.640]   Very clever. Yeah. Yep. Yep. And actually we should outside of the changelog. We should discuss the how to eat sushi
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.920]   Uh google search results as well, but we'll do that later for now. Um, that's all i've got
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.640]   And that's you don't want to do that on you hygiene it
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.320]   No
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.480]   Am I going to get nude pictures or something and that's the google changelog
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:06.520]   Uh apparently this advice from google, uh, no longer there by the way on how to each eat sushi this is from
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.480]   Uh, should I even mention this?
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.440]   Uh, yeah, I think I can
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:17.080]   This is from google answers and so it showed up in a knowledge box, right?
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:23.880]   It's a knowledge. Yeah, it's the knowledge graph, right? Which basically just parses data from other websites and presents it inside of search results
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.360]   So you would google how to eat sushi and you get a few whatever
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.600]   Instructions back from the house. It's okay to use your fingers to eat cut sushi rolls
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.120]   Don't combine ginger and sushi or ginger and soy sauce
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.920]   Ginger the pickle ginger is a palate cleanser
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:43.720]   When dipping sushi in soy sauce dip fish side down didn't know that very useful
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.920]   And never shake the soy sauce off sushi. That's like shaking your wanker in public what
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:53.160]   What?
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   But it's you know, I would give you whatever
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.480]   It's not a big deal obviously it's text scraped from another site
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:03.800]   But people made it big deal about it because it was kind of like we were talking about native advertising
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.960]   It may be it may is maybe is not clear that this is text from another site
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.760]   Right so people are saying oh google saying this thing about how to eat sushi when google is not saying it at all
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:18.760]   But it's the presentation that creates some of the confusion and to their credit. It was a googler who outed google
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:27.320]   Uh, steven louis software engineer with google glass tweeted psa public service announcement google how to eat sushi do it now before it gets fixed
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:34.360]   And this this is sort of live by the sword die by the sword in terms of the knowledge box or one box
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:39.480]   Right because this is this was from a vice article and vice of all publications should be pretty obvious
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:45.000]   It's gonna have some stuff that maybe you don't like really page despite its name. I thought vice was actually pretty
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.760]   It's very credible. They do brachialism and then they also do a lot a bunch of
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.480]   This right okay
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.680]   So it's but well like everything there's no every media outlet is very very high brown right very low today, right?
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.840]   It is true isn't it? Yeah, and they're used to I don't think it even happens anymore
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:05.160]   but they're used to be these objections about bringing content in on one boxes and knowledge boxes because
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:11.320]   uh, you're you're competing with publishers in some way and and they don't have any uh, real
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:17.000]   Choice but to accommodate that because it's also the thing that's going to drive more traffic
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.440]   Um, and so when you bring in, you know with wikipedia
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:24.680]   I'm sure there are tons of wikipedia articles that have been defaced at the top
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:29.720]   Odd, you know automatically scraped into a knowledge box on google and you can get some ridiculous results
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.080]   Uh, if you if you take a look, um, that
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.720]   Should be one of the reasons that google should even be more cautious about bringing this this content in
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.600]   I mean, I think
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.680]   I'm old-fashioned but I remember a time when google would give you results that took you to another site
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:48.680]   Uh and as much as the it's sort of has been conventional wisdom that oh, it's convenient and it's easy and it's faster to get in here
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.640]   I still
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.680]   Like that idea that they used to be about taking you to the content as opposed to bringing the content into their site
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.840]   Well, you do sound like an old timer when you say google gave you results that brought you another site
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.320]   Those days
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.320]   Wasn't that the purpose of google?
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.320]   I think it took you all to vista
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:10.520]   Gina and I got up a little bit early this morning a little earlier for me than you
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:17.800]   Uh six a.m for me nine a.m for you to go to berlin virtually for the sam sangh unpacked event
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.960]   They called it what chapter two because it was the second part two
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.160]   The second unpacked event of the year
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.520]   Uh, they did the galaxy as five earlier this year
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.640]   Uh, this announcement was the note four galaxy note four a five point seven inch fablet
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:39.960]   That features an improved camera both front and back. They made a big deal about selfies. I think selfies are
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:46.120]   Uh increasingly going to be something important the front facing camera and not for skype or or facetime
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:52.840]   But for pictures they even showed what do they call it? Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, we uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, we
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:59.880]   We fee. Yeah, we fee which is so you could panel it was like a basically a selfie panel, right?
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:04.280]   Right. I really liked that the shutter actually there was a hardware shutter on the back of the phone that I actually was like, yes
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.120]   I want that we've seen that on the other phones. Yeah, but no, that's a good idea
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.400]   I mean, this is sam sangh they just throw everything against the wall and see what sticks
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.680]   How wide is your head have to be for a panoramic selfie?
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.200]   I don't know it was to get to the people
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:22.760]   More but to get the background more and that's what you're seeing in these selfies
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.120]   Now is and that's why the selfie stick because you don't want just you you want right you want
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:33.640]   Context that live demo was great. They got the three and i lost the entire
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:41.000]   Audience behind them and of course they did the call back to ellen selfie at the uh at the oscars the we fee with all the celebrities in it or whatever
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.120]   Which was which made a lot of sense and which they paid for we should
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.160]   Make sure they paid for i'm sure handsomely no doubt
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.040]   Uh, and of course they had the i'm going to need
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:57.080]   Go ahead jeff. Sorry. I was gonna get you go by i knew albama needs it to get the ears in the in the selfie
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:03.960]   I know i do me. I have a giant pumpkin head and I actually i'm fine with people having the selfie stick
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:09.560]   I was down by the the world trade center and and these tourists had a selfie stick out and it was sort of I mean at first
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.960]   You're like that's strange and then after a while it's like that's not actually that different than having a tripod
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.080]   or something that
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.600]   Um people have been doing so that i'm fine with that but i i'm a little
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.240]   Like some of the things well, this is very sam song
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:26.760]   It's a they just are trying whatever and seeing what sticks and i'm like be about something half a point of view
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.720]   Say this is what we're trying to do. I wish they were more directed and said okay
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:35.560]   This is the selfie feature we want to enable and this is the reason why i'm trying to see if they uh posted
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:42.600]   On their sam's song account the picture they have this is the image from the event of the wide selfie
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.000]   Um, but I was going to try to find the picture that they took they should have tweeted it
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.520]   Um because it really did it looked good. It was really pretty impressive. It was a portrait pano
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.000]   I was deeply troubled that these photos were taken in portrait
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:01.480]   Well, if you're going to do a pano and you do it in portrait you get more pixels more you get right you get more height
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.040]   I get that I get that still it troubled me
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:09.080]   Here's here's a shot from the video
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.440]   But it looks like although it's hard to tell it came out pretty well
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.240]   um, yeah
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:20.760]   And I mean, I forever I will credit Bradley Cooper for landscaping that business on the outskirts
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.800]   Right, Ellen was going to portrait it. Let's go. He was doing
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:29.960]   That means he's it nowadays that crowns is a bit of a greek. Oh, that's probably why sure right
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.360]   Yeah, I mean these people stand in front of cameras for a living kind of know a little bit about this. I hope so
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:43.000]   Um, they also showed the note for edge, which is a little tiny bit smaller than enough for because
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.680]   Uh, it then has a kind of like 150 160 pixel
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:51.320]   Curved screen on the side. They say that's a separate screen by the way now. I'm reading
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.880]   Um that shows you
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:58.680]   Shows you what why it's like a ticker, but it goes
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.880]   Diagonally
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   And it's got its own sdk
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.800]   It shows you that one engineer was able to get a little sliver of curved screen working
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.760]   And they wanted to ship it no matter what even if it had no point
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.680]   Well, in fact when they showed it, um, I don't know if I can
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:19.960]   Yeah, here's the publicity shot when they in the in the publicity shot if you look closely
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.680]   um, you'll notice that the
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.440]   Look look at the temperature on the right there. It's upside down
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.080]   Perfect. So then this is in there. Uh, this is in there shots
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.840]   So at least maybe the photo's not faked then
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:42.040]   They have a little bit something to work on there. Um, it also means it would be very hard to hold that phone
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.680]   Um because the
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.560]   Head buttons we don't mean to mashable has video with a hands-on once I get past the uh
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:57.720]   I'll make another old person reference, which is do you remember side talking have we side talking? So side talk is probably 2003
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:05.080]   Uh, no cure released the first end gauge and they had some other business phones like this where instead of uh, you talking into your
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.520]   Your phone like a normal person would you talked into the side of it?
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.080]   See it's upside down
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.560]   Maybe a re-orient itself
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:19.000]   And everybody made fun of it on the internet for like a good couple weeks about why would you ever talk into the side of your phone as
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.720]   Right side touching side touching
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:26.840]   And I don't like you to side different buttons sides aren't
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   They are buttons. They're just virtual buttons
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:37.000]   With this phone I pull out my pocket and it's like it's a gigantic us because i'm constantly turning it around saying is it
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   Other side right side right side
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.680]   Yes, we know
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:47.720]   I'm on a reserve judgment it on the face of it looks like it's not going to be great, but
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:52.200]   And then they announced also a watch that is clearly
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.160]   Way too big
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:01.160]   Um, this is we were just counting off the air. I think there are six or seven
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.920]   Watches from samsung. They actually showed three today
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:09.720]   Including a watch that looks like it's an iphone strapped to your wrist
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.680]   Um
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.280]   The uh
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:19.880]   They didn't by the way none of the prices are availability was uh, was revealed for any of this
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.760]   Um, and they showed they showed three watches today. I thought it was just the curved
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:31.640]   Six icon grid watch today and the vr and the edge well they had a band remember with it had an e paper
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.760]   They didn't call it a watch that was so many was that sony?
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:42.440]   I'm you're right. Yeah, so many you're right. I'm think i'm confusing the two sony had the and their first android
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:47.560]   Where watch there it is right and the band and it was this big galaxy watch that they issued your ass
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:51.960]   Samsung might only be offering five watches not sick. I might have missed counted
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.840]   the gear s smart watch is
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.720]   the size of an iphone on your wrist
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.560]   Uh
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.360]   And uh has a band to match which is interesting
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:06.440]   Uh, don't go away leo. Yes, you're you're you're unfashionable now officially
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.400]   I'm so out of it with my old android war watch
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:14.520]   You're a white bear in my white band. Oh no. I tried to change the band and it didn't work
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.200]   So i'm just gonna stick with the way. Oh really? Well, I realized i'm gonna have a new watch any minute now
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.320]   Anyway, why bother? Yeah, either the watcher or the three subits
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.520]   He's gonna show uh for the this at the yes. Yeah, yeah
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:30.440]   They also announced a virtual reality helmet that they've worked on in conjunction with oculus rif
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.600]   john karmack joined the stage
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:37.320]   Uh to talk a little bit about the technology and they modify the android kernel to make this thing fast
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.600]   You slide a note for and it will only work with a note for in this uh headset and you've got uh
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.160]   Oculus rif style virtual reality. This is just of course like the google
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:53.720]   Cardboard version that was given away at google.io a little spiffier and i'm sure a lot more expensive
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:54:00.680]   And uh equally nauseating probably who is the fab lit headset user who's that person
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:08.040]   I don't know who is that um, I never met the fab lit headset target audience
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.560]   Well, they made noble yes goble they made one oh
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:15.480]   They made one use case which actually I thought wasn't bad which is in an airplane
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:22.360]   Um, they said it's it's like having 127 being two feet away from 127 inch screen
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.560]   That's watching the movie
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:30.680]   On the air thing i want but if you want a work orange that's a threat that kind of program people's brain
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:35.320]   That's not if you keep your eyes open and the students could drop a little visey in in once in a while
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:39.320]   Um, no the chair in front of you will slam back and hit your head
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.880]   Is it so far extended?
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.680]   Well, anyway, and uh that looked like it was a prototype
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:49.080]   Put it on his head is not it was not a state that's you'll put anything on his head. Yeah
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.240]   and has
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:56.840]   Right, uh, I don't and this does require the note before this won't work with just any phone and you could see it's carefully
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.880]   Uh made to fit the note for exactly
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:06.200]   Or really it's crazy how well google preempted this whole thing with cardboard. Yeah, they knew it was coming
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:11.560]   Um, it's also a brilliant thing google did where they literally took
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.520]   the second most costly acquisition facebook has ever made and said
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.880]   We can do this in for one dollars worth of cardboard
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.760]   like I like in terms of just you know
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:27.640]   Yeah, it was the ultimate role. It was such a like a nicely beautifully
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:33.480]   Tastefully done completely mean spirited thing. I loved that. That was really good. We can do that. Oh, yeah
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:39.880]   We can just ruin their birthday party. You know, it was so good right after the uh, sam song event at ef uh by the way all of those
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.920]   Devices will be available someday. They announced that and
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.280]   No one is gonna be in it october, right?
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:53.720]   Yeah, the phone the note before will be out in october and available in all four actually five us carriers including us cellular
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.880]   I don't think that strap a strap a note to your head thing is ever gonna be available
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:04.840]   Well, I think they'll say it got released but there will be no actual human maybe google glass. How many people bought google glass?
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.200]   Uh a few schmucks like me. Yeah
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:16.520]   Ask me when I last turned it on right I spent uh considerable amount of money to on the kickstarter project for the oculus rift and
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:22.760]   I just uh yesterday gave a war sunday gave away my oculus rift of dev kit to a young lad
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.640]   on the street
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.720]   Just protective safety goggles that look nicer. I know it's silly
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.120]   They made a point about how good it looked actually
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:37.240]   Right after was the sony event and the sony uh folks announced new zed three
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.960]   phones with very high resolution screens very high quality 20 megapixel
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.200]   cameras
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:49.400]   Um, and then of course this is just the beginning tomorrow is the moat-a-roll event not in berlin
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.960]   But unaccountably in chicago
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.240]   Where no one is right now and
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.120]   The actually tires city is empty
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:03.000]   Um, and they're gonna announce the moat-o 360 flat tire watch
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.400]   Flat tire watch the 270 yeah. Yeah, and then yes
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.080]   and then uh, uh, the moat-o-x and a g2
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.640]   Um both of which I think I think the g has turned out to be kind of a successful
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:20.600]   As a surprise success. I love the moat-o-x and i'm looking forward to the next generation
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:24.360]   Um, I think it was android central that said it will be called the moat-o-x
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.640]   Just the new moat-o-x and the g will be called the g2
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:33.720]   Um and still be very affordable. Yes. Yeah that well your guess is as good as mine this fall
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:35.880]   I guess
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:39.240]   Now these companies been a little bit cagey about release dates, which uh,
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:44.280]   Enclines me to think they're rushing to get these announcements out before apple makes its announcement next week
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:49.480]   For sure, you know, what model was that moat-a-roll that I loaned you? I don't remember what that thing was the moat-o-x
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:55.240]   Yeah, that was a great phone. That's a great. I just like it, but I don't remember what my one of the best phones of the year
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.440]   Even though it was kind of a little bit below par on specs
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:03.480]   I just loved its functionality if this moat-o-x brings it up to flagship standards
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:09.960]   Uh and retain some of that always on functionality. I think it's just gonna be a great phone. I despite the red hat
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:16.840]   It wasn't a terrible phone. It was a pretty good phone. I like the red hat. Oh, man. You could do that on your cardboard. Did you know that?
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:22.360]   The red hat thing? Yeah, the flying hat. Yeah, well, it makes sense right because that's what it was. Yeah
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:27.400]   You know, anneal got like the special edition that came with like a
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:31.080]   Special box with like a forest that you'd unfold it or whatever
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.440]   It came with a little plastic red hat that had a magnet on it
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:37.800]   You could touch to the screen to invoke the soft flag. It was
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.600]   It was like absurd beyond I couldn't you I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:47.560]   It was literally the prettiest packaging I've ever seen certainly of any electronic advice. How do I get on that list?
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.560]   Probably nice. I don't know. I think it was like it must have been an error. They must have mistaken
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.520]   Anyone on earth should have that it's Chad
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.200]   Because he's got red hair. He should have red hat
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:04.280]   Oh, yeah, I got I got on the wrong list somehow where they were like they missed took me for somebody that was literate in these things
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.360]   Perhaps you was to be for someone who cares
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.640]   No, no, it was I mean it's a great phone. It's an amazing phone
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:14.360]   And I actually I liked the red hat experience. I thought it was very cinematic and engaging
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.560]   There's two of them
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.360]   So there's the red hat and then there's a squirrel in his nuts
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:24.920]   Yeah, yeah, right the mouse on the squirrel. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, I think I got an email about you can go check that out
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.680]   I didn't I didn't do that but the
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:31.080]   You know the phone itself was great. It's a great piece of hardware. So I think any improvement to that will be awesome
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:36.600]   Tomorrow there will be a I am told a dyson vacuum cleaner announcement as well
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:45.720]   There you go secret product. I'm headed to efa on sunday. Are you oh good for you? It's over, isn't it?
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:46.520]   Are there good?
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:51.320]   No, there's some extended you know efa plus thing that I'm speaking. Oh good
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.600]   so hoe Berlin
[00:59:55.400 --> 01:00:00.040]   and then somebody in the chat room apparently talking about our mocking of the
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.160]   virtual reality helmet says
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.880]   You guys don't even know what it's for you're not funny
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:09.880]   So apparently it's fair one guy was the problem wants it
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:15.960]   Last week. This was the problem last week with with twitch tried it was plain twitch to me. Yeah, oh the
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.160]   the abuse we got
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:26.680]   I will I will gladly fall on the sort of unfunny about wearing a fablet on your head
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:31.000]   How do you where do you stand on twitch.tv the gaming network?
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.240]   I think it is uh everybody's interesting is watching sports. Okay, there you go
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:41.240]   So you two like me are not a real man is that it?
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:48.120]   I uh I I meant exactly what I said. You can tell from my tweets. I tweet a lot during award shows
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.960]   Yeah, maybe yeah the golden gloves, maybe
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.680]   Yeah, nobody watched the emmys. Oh apparently
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:02.200]   No real award shows emmys or shows the count like grammys Oscars that kind of right so it's uh, it's the crazy season
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.480]   Lots of products coming out next week apples announcement. Uh, will we then be done? I don't know
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.120]   It's kind of hard to imagine where do we get in the watches you think no idea?
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.760]   I think none of this is uh apparently they don't even have fcc approval for the note for
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.920]   So we're a few months off maybe even though I mean the uh the I watch yes my day I watch
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.480]   Is I watch gonna happen?
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.120]   I think it's gonna happen and apple wants to freeze the market. Yeah, right?
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.480]   So they they want to say like don't buy before christmas. We're not gonna be ready till next year
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.640]   We're gonna show you something really cool, but you got to wait
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.840]   It's a perfect way to do it because it gets developers time to get ready
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.400]   Uh it ruins christmas for everybody else
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:45.800]   Uh and still will sell a bunch of iphones while people get ready for you know save up to be able to buy a watch in the new year
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.800]   Here's the question any of them
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.280]   So if you're an apple person you're an apple person if you're an android person you're an android person
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.400]   Can apple announce things that will
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.440]   convert people back
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.440]   for mandarin
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.080]   Yeah, I mean I think they're already I think there are a lot of people
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.840]   I think there's actually a lot more flux in movement between the platforms when people realize you know people are up for renewal
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.240]   They look at all the phones that are out there
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.360]   Outside of techies there isn't a huge amount of allegiance
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.040]   So like all this screens bigger or my friend has this app and I should get that
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.880]   I don't think it's much more thought than that. I think the conversation is android or apple
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.000]   I tried to rule my kids with Motorola Xs after they broke their iPhones
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.560]   I said well, I'm not buying any other iphones and new ones coming out, but try this Moto X both of them
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.880]   Well, Henry won't Henry said oh, I can't figure out how to charge it. That's such a lie
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:39.800]   Right. Well kids are a different thing, right? But that's the margin
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:45.080]   Right, but there's no question there 20 and 22. These are the guys you want to get if you're apple or
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.280]   High school in college. There's no question apple is the cool brand
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.840]   And and this is where the brand fact
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.720]   I don't buy into a lot of the fragmentation story around android
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.920]   But in terms of brand fragmentation sam's song is not cool in this way that they're respected. They're fine
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   They're not cool sam's song is not cool google's own phones are not a factor
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.560]   You don't have a brand that has that cache
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:12.040]   That they do, you know having an apple logo on something so I think in that regard for young people
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:17.000]   That's not it's not the same thing. It's just a different kind of I am probably going to go back to the iphone
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.320]   with a bigger screen and
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.200]   Customizable keyboards, but I am also
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.160]   Bracing myself for disappointment
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.040]   So we'll see what happens
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.840]   But I'm one of those people who's who's looking forward actually to going back to the iphone
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:37.400]   Mostly because of the of the variety of apps that get released on iphone only it's very frustrating
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.000]   And the apps are still better. They still are good stuff
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   That's a absurdity right there
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.520]   That's that's that's geeks not looking at enough market research
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.080]   Well, that's assuming that any of these decisions are based on some rational process
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.560]   And that's not how we buy a thing that we hold in our handle
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.880]   That's totally emotional because from a technical point of view. There's not much difference between any of the plot
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.280]   No, no
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.760]   I'm talking about a deal is is the number and I hear spaces all the time in the news business
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.160]   Where they'll write an app
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:12.600]   And yt now they still haven't written an android version that's absurd right absurd. There's a huge audience out there. What do I think their goals are?
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:21.560]   Instagram says we'll write hyperlapse for android as soon as we the hardware capability is there
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.320]   Or the api is there so that's a technical reason
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.240]   Um, but I see absol every day. I see apps that are iphone only
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.200]   Is getting smaller. It's still there. It is getting smaller. I agree
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.800]   If you're looking at you know small startups, you know putting out, I mean
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.360]   Yeah, there's gonna be a couple apps that come out on iOS first that it happens less than it used to
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   And yeah, I don't know it's I mean there's there's certainly still this notion that you know
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.280]   You got to prove yourself an iOS first and that's where the money is
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:57.880]   Um, you know that android users don't spend as much money on apps or an in-app purchase
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:01.960]   I also think that that gap is narrowing if that still even remains true now
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.000]   Um, but yeah, no, I mean, I I agree
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.280]   I think it's really stupid for companies to to you know would release iOS only first and then just say oh, yeah
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.160]   You know some doubt some time down the road will release to android just doesn't make sense market share wise
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.360]   We're gonna take a break come back with more our show today brought to you by personal capital

[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:29.080]   twig
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.160]   So
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:35.080]   If you've seen random favorites inserted into your twitter timeline
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.000]   Uh, it's because you don't either fall enough people or the people you follow aren't really doing anything
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.960]   So they've decided twitters decided to spiff things up with by sticking favorites in there
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:53.160]   The costalow explains in a tweet you get favorites when you pull to refresh twice and we have no new tweets both times
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:57.480]   The response to the tweet responds to that numerical precious
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:06.920]   Uh, and then ed yong responds hilarious if true everyone twitter why twitter cause monkey press lever monkey get no snack monkeys
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.160]   sad
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:16.200]   You know, this is just this called reruns friends, uh, nothing good on tv. Here's some of your favorite tweets
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.040]   What a what a missed opportunity from twitter, right? So this is this thing where
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:25.160]   All this sort of twitter junkies are really mad. Why are these tweets showing up? I didn't follow this person
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.560]   It's so it's if I wanted them to retweet it. I would retweet it and you're just showing me favorites of my friends
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.400]   All this confusion and dismay right and and what they could have easily done
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.960]   Is announced it said you know what we're done
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.640]   We experimented with
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.600]   When people want more of twitter and they tell us by refreshing twice
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.920]   We're gonna give you a little magic
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:46.120]   Prize of something that your friend likes and people be like that's delightful
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.480]   It's thoughtful right anticipated what I want and because they didn't communicate about it instead of one the exact
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.400]   loser
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.400]   You know nobody interesting
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.960]   And you're viewing the experience because now I can't predict what's going to be in my stream
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:04.040]   So now twitter broke its promise to me about i'm only going to show me stuff that I follow
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:08.120]   And so they got the worst of both situations and it's one of those things where you like
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.080]   You know a one paragraph blog post could have turned this around for them if they day out ahead of it
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.960]   And it's a it's a weird thing like the companies that make social platforms are usually the worst of talking about them
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.920]   It's really an object lesson in communications and marketing
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.320]   Google has the same problem
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:28.520]   And if you just if you just announce it in a in a clever creative way, you can make people very happy
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.600]   You know who's good at this apple?
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.320]   Yeah
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.720]   Apple knows apple is so good at it
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.840]   And by the way a great article from mark german and nine to five mac
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:44.520]   On apple's marketing machine and how it manipulates the media really long article brilliant. This guy's 20 years old
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:50.520]   Smart kid when I was 20 years old. I was still wondering why did he get any surprises in my cereal
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.960]   And he is analyzing marketing strategy at apple like a pro. I mean, it's just not
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:01.800]   I loved that article. There's an interesting thing in it where he says well apple manipulated coverage with an outlet by doing this
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.120]   Right and he just talks about how it happens and who did it
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:09.080]   But he sort of the lives which outlet was manipulated or exactly what story it was about
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.080]   So he's sort of letting the other outlets say face and it's a very it's a nice
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.600]   Like it's a very thoughtful thing to do
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:19.720]   But the whole way through a capacitor who was being manipulated who got snooker by apple on this and he any sort of
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.000]   That's the only place where he pulls the punches. It's about talking about how
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.560]   fellow reporters. Yeah, yeah, because he also makes a spreadsheet of which
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.760]   Journalists receive early copies of which mac products
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.000]   And you can very clearly on your own correlate it to who gets the best
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.400]   Apple coverage
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:44.040]   It's it's uh, that's a brave thing to do. That's pretty much guaranteeing you'll be on apple's
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.760]   uh list for some time to come
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.840]   Um, yeah, it's a great. I love that grid because that was one of the things
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.080]   I think I mentally had as a geek, you know, you kind of know
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.080]   Oh, well that was interesting when she and he got the ipad
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.080]   Right for bling blowing and I hadn't noticed that before and I definitely remember the route
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.840]   Uh getting the ipad because it was like oh the apple is pretty, you know
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:08.120]   Conscientiously courting the african-american audience here and they hadn't done that before so that was really cool
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.600]   But seeing it all laid out was this sort of good
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:16.360]   They're thoughtful right there they have a plan and I think that is the contrast to why I get frustrated with
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.440]   Samsung saying let's just splatter stuff up against the wall at 10 different watches
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.200]   Because it's like well
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.840]   There's a there's a lot to be said for being disciplined. Yeah
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.000]   um
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.760]   Let me show you the spreadsheet because you it's kind of when you when you look at it's this is deep within this article
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.120]   Um, it's kind of telling because you can immediately see
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.440]   By the checkboxes. So the green check marks are people who got
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.000]   iOS device review access
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.440]   Prior to the release the reds or when nobody got it a non-tech
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:53.560]   Didn't get it until very very recently and of course interestingly both brian clug and an on
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.240]   El los jimpy from an on tech i've just defected to apple
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:03.800]   Um, yeah, and the anachos must have been too good. Yeah, a lot of a lot of red x's for our friend andy
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.680]   Boing Boing got two specific devices the ipad and the ipon for never again
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:14.200]   But then you see people like oh david poged big who get green checks everywhere
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.760]   Yeah, even even more than seen it. Yeah, I mean big is always interesting because super talented guy great writer
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:28.600]   He's not you know a sort of tech household name like a wal-maspurk is but he's always been this very reliable sort of apple voice
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:35.000]   And he's also has a bully pulpit. I mean sure you can merely say well look a pog wrote for the new york times
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.240]   Big wrote for us a today those people probably should although here's jase's still editor in chief of mac world magazine
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.640]   who only three times
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:49.000]   Out of the total dozen got device ahead of time so well mac world is on the outside apple
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.280]   But the interesting thing about it is uh ed is still at your city today, but but you know both uh
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.000]   Walt and and and pog have left their sort of big newspapers
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   But you see this sort of legacy and I think in the article he says you know jobs was one of those people that like judged media outlets
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   By what he got in print as a kid
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.920]   And and they're still sort of saying well, this is how you do reputable and respectable is what was on dead trees
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:20.280]   Yeah, yeah, cuz you look at mashable, which is clearly influential bunch of red ashes. Yeah, yeah, um
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.240]   so
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:30.040]   Kudos to mark german for really speaking truth to power. That's a brave thing to do when you have a media machine that is so effective
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.280]   It's also a confident thing. He knows he's got enough meat to what he covers
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:39.880]   Yeah, that he doesn't need to rely on this sort of the kindness of the company seeing through illusion understanding apple's
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.520]   mastery of the media
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.520]   and uh
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.600]   Over second be we'll see a lot of that soon
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.360]   It should be a business school case study. Yeah, this is how you do media
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.960]   Well, and it really stands out because so so many companies do it so poorly as in this case of a twitter
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.680]   Where they just turn a win into a loss
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.160]   I mean just that's ridiculous. Yeah snatching defeat from the jolly victory. Yeah, yeah
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:08.040]   Twitter is now doing kind of improving the intake process
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.680]   Uh one of the issues twitter's always had is when you sign up as a new user to twitter. It's a little baffling. It's like well now what?
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.520]   um
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.320]   So they've done the first redesign in three years of
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.520]   the sign up process you identify your interests
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.480]   fashion photography entertainment news
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:30.200]   And then they suggest users they've always had a suggested users list
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.160]   um
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.240]   But it's it's designed to get you interested in it from right from the very beginning
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.800]   I haven't played with it because how is it possible they went three years without you?
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:42.840]   Isn't that odd?
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:47.400]   Sign up. Is that like that doesn't even sound plausible doesn't I know well, maybe it's wrong with that
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.400]   So hundreds and hundreds of engineers
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.440]   Oh, they had other things it feels like they're differentiating small tweaks from major overhauls
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.400]   Well, and they and they were working on getting the Justin Bieber servers, uh, run and run as a
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:04.040]   Very you know speaking of favorites the activity column and tweet deck is
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.560]   Amazing. It's like every single thing that your friends favorite
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.160]   Like as it happens and it just like it's like a ticker tape
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:17.320]   I mean it just flies down but that column is is unbelievable. I mean a seeing your friends favorites is actually really really cool
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:22.520]   Um, the problem was that they legislate you said that they just didn't didn't pre-announce it didn't handle it, right?
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:28.200]   The results are in of course the FCC asking for comments
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.640]   Uh pro and con on that neutrality over a million comments came in fewer than 1%
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.560]   We're against that neutrality. Well, there's a shocker
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.320]   I'm again it
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.400]   Um, I don't know if that was one of your numbers
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.120]   um
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:56.840]   I think that's I think we pretty much covered everything. I'm just looking any stories you guys wanted to bring up
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.200]   I don't know if this is amusing stewart bakers so you can tell what the google thinks you're famous
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.440]   You see that one. How do you know? Oh, yeah
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:07.480]   Well, there's so
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:13.880]   The right to be forgotten stuff like google has some sort of measure or they indicated and their statements about it
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.520]   That there's some sort of measure about whether or not you're a public figure
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.680]   Um, so and this article I read this article just really quickly
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.600]   So if you search for yourself or for someone who you want to know whether or not google thinks you're a public
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:28.440]   Public figure at the bottom if google thinks you're a public figure it'll say
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.000]   Results may have been removed
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.200]   The opposite that's the word. Okay. It's the other way
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.840]   Right if you're famous, they're not going to remove stuff
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:41.480]   If you're if you're a public figure they're not they're not going to remove stuff right because it's public interest
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:45.960]   Is that that that's right? So now everybody's googling themselves. I mean you see
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:49.320]   I didn't have it. It's at the bottom. I don't have it at the bottom of mine
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.360]   I don't have it but I'm putting somebody who's just not famous
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.000]   See if this works
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.520]   Under the UK search has to be UK. Oh, it's in UK
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.080]   Oh
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.240]   Oh, yeah, yeah, of course because it's not uh
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:07.400]   It's not okay. Let me look for myself again in google uk because maybe I
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:13.160]   Maybe I won't be famous enough there. I can tell myself that I'm not famous in england. Right? That's that's the issue
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.880]   Yeah, no, nothing
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:21.000]   Nothing for me. No, if you're famous it doesn't say anything if you're Chad johnson
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.920]   Let's see if it says anything
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.640]   Oh, yeah, that's kind of gonna be an issue with apparently there's quite a few Chad johnson's just cinco
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.880]   Yeah, all right. Well, let's pick somebody uh
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.080]   So where will it say why did it offer me Chad?
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:39.560]   Ochi no chinko. You don't know who Chad ocho cinco is cinco
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.840]   Chateau chasinko
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.760]   He's well, he related to chad shots sports sports ball sports ball
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:48.280]   Yeah, that's why I don't like uh my real name
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.280]   Huh
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.040]   All right, he also not there if some results jeff. I can't hear you is not there
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.560]   So that's not there for me on uk so you're famous. I don't know if I buy this that can't be right
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:04.200]   That can't be right. I don't I don't buy. Well. I mean if you've got a wikipedia page you're famous
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.040]   Maybe that's how they do it. Yeah, you you all
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.040]   I think that that's a signal
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:16.520]   Anneal don't you have a wikipedia page? I do but i'm saying you all do too. Yeah, we all have wikipedia
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.440]   So you're all famous. Yeah, we actually that's one of the criteria for getting on the show
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.600]   Oh
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:28.040]   No, i'm just kidding. Jeff just left that and having a working internet connection
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:32.040]   Google's android where team says we'll update early and often
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.760]   I'm still wearing waiting for an update and by the way google you better hurry because I don't know if this watch is going to stay
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.520]   Am I risk much longer
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.680]   There seems to be some competition coming
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.400]   Well the mojo 360
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.680]   The apple I watch and that ginormous watch from samson
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.400]   Well, the 360 is android where the ginormous watches is
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:57.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, i'm not real. I don't think i don't think it goes really worried about tyson. Are they?
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.560]   I don't know no after seeing that watch they'd be crazy to be worried
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:08.680]   Go ahead check it get Jeff back while we're getting Jeff back. I'm gonna tell you a little bit about my friends at smart
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.160]   You can't hear me. I can't hear you. Yeah, we can. Oh, welcome back. Jeff

[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.000]   You're such an Italian. You want to say the chochenko?
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.920]   How do you say smart things in Italian
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:37.160]   Smart things
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.680]   Smart things
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.200]   This my friends. This was the kickstarter project that I kicked into
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:46.920]   Way back. You did actually gene it in you. You were a kick smarter supporter of smart things
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:51.080]   I did why 12 2012. It was a friend of a friend
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:56.200]   Who was involved with it and honestly, you know look like any quick starter. I watched the video and like and they got me
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.400]   I wanted it
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:02.520]   Um, and I got to tell you I love it. I mean the kit that I have i'm sure is an early prototype compared to what they're selling now
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.400]   Oh, yeah
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:09.400]   I I've loved it. I loved it. They have really they solved the problem if you have
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:15.880]   Uh, if you're trying to have a smartphone the issue is of course nothing talks to anything and you could get a system
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.080]   Uh like the smart thing system and that'll talk to everything
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:24.360]   In the system but never talks to anything else. So the smart things hub is the cornerstone to all this
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.960]   Yes, of course smart thing has three home security kits for now
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.280]   For brand new solution kits which are designed to solve specific problems
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:38.200]   But they also integrate with your GE locks your schleg your honeywell eon nest

[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.840]   uh, and your sonos music system you can create an amazing array of
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:53.320]   Uh, uh things you said what are you doing? You haven't tie into your music

[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:00.600]   It one of the sensors that um tells you whether or not something's been opened or closed
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:05.880]   I had it hooked up to my mailbox. So when my mail came my my physical postal mail. I would get a push notification
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.040]   Um
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:08.920]   Like that
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.440]   Yeah, and the present sensor I had on my my daughter's stroller
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:17.880]   Um, so when she went out for a walk and came back like I would get a push notification that she was home
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.920]   That is home
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.840]   Yeah, yeah, there was some really cool
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.880]   I you know I had the lights program to come on when you're the night light to come on when it's sunset
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:31.480]   Um, which is really nice. They're iftt recipes. It's a really open. It's a it's a very open platform. It's very very cool
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:36.840]   Yeah, and now they have a maker kit so you can integrate your argywino project. So really the sky's the limit
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.600]   I mean this is wide open
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.640]   So every kit includes this the hub which is the key of course

[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.520]   Your tip of the week
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:07.400]   Yes, uh, this is a new one to me. It's a really tiny subtle google docs thing that I was unaware of
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:14.280]   But i'm often dealing with multi page documents in google docs and I didn't realize this but as you're scrolling through
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:19.800]   A multi page document. There's a little tool tip on the scroll bar that tells you what page you're on
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:23.640]   Uh, I had just never noticed it before but there it is it works
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:29.800]   Um, so yeah keep an eye on that if you're if you're reviewing long long boring documents in google docs
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.120]   Like I have been doing recently almost done
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.360]   almost
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.440]   Page 37 of 50
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.080]   God, maybe I don't want to know
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:42.600]   Right. I'm i'm student from out with a tome
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.400]   The
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:50.920]   Farness now that the internet has ruined everything what next it's 180 pages in google doc
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:54.920]   It's a killer. There you go. They're that tool tip forever to load
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:58.600]   What's it about again?
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:04.280]   Um, okay smart ass now that the internet has ruined news what next oh it's
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:07.640]   Everybody says okay, jorvis. What's your view? Okay?
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:11.800]   So finally I kind of write down everything that I think there it is and then what's believe me next
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.480]   What's next? It's it's aimed at my geeks
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:19.720]   I think I think you need to rebrand it though. I don't think that white paper really sells it well
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:21.720]   I think you have to try it. I know
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:24.520]   Can you make it a medium essay would it fit into the text area?
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:29.000]   I'm gonna do I'm gonna put it all up on medium for free because I have for smashing pay walls
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.280]   I can't do that and the title is geeks bearing gifts. Uh, not what would Jarvis do? That's good too
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:40.280]   That's where you gotta go. I mean, that's what would jeffy do
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:47.320]   That's I was I know exactly what that book is about. What would Jarvis do what would Jarvis do?
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.480]   Uh-oh
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:52.040]   And he oh wait, jeff you're gonna give us a number here
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:57.480]   Well, yeah, I just didn't know about this. You know about ground truth countries and google maps. No
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:04.120]   So there's now 50 of them and I said what the heck is a ground truth company country? So, um
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:10.920]   Google determines certain countries need better maps and not though there aren't also other crowdsource mapping solutions
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.160]   So they make it an effort and bring people in to try to help improve maps and add add
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:22.280]   more richness to the maps on and so they now have 50 countries that they focus on to
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.560]   Radically improve the maps there. So I just found that vaguely interested not terribly interested just vaguely. That's pretty cool
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.880]   I was also desperate for a number. So when I saw 50 I jumped at it, but you know
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:39.480]   Well, I mean open street maps is uh is a really cool idea
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:45.080]   But this I guess this puts it into the google maps which after all is what everybody uses. Uh, exactly
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.000]   So
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.760]   Cool, there it is. It was a bad way. You know some weeks. It's funny. I'll have 20 numbers
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.400]   You'll see some weeks. They're just not a number to be had
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:57.720]   And the only thing you want to I looks like you want to share a little something
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:02.680]   That's a twitter account that I thought everybody should follow. It's really interesting. It's called valley edits
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:09.320]   And it's a spin-off. There's a whole series of twitter accounts. Uh, parliament wiki edits out of the uk was the first
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:16.440]   uh, then led into uh, congress edits which also is a great follow and congress edits says, uh, you know, anonymous members of
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.320]   Uh, con- anonymous members of the staff of congress are making edits to wikipedia
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.320]   We should see what articles are editing and valley edits is that for the big tech companies
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.800]   So if you look at twitter and apple and google and facebook
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:32.120]   What are their employees while on the clock at the job at the office?
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.600]   Editing on wikipedia some of these are silly and light like, you know, apple
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.720]   Employees editing a pressure cooker entry
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:45.320]   But it's something where we think about like wikipedia so much of the definitive record of what culture is
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.520]   Then let's see if uh, there's any self interest going on for these tech companies writing about
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.400]   Things that actually directly impact them. So it's something
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:57.240]   Um, it's nice because it's it's not a ton of tweets. It's not really really noisy
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:04.200]   But if you want to look at the impact of like, well, how are these big tech companies trying to actually shape the world and shape culture?
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.840]   Uh, it can be really powerful. Uh, there's also I think you know, you look at the
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:12.920]   The topics they're writing about and they can be a little bit of an indication of well
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:17.400]   Somebody over at that company thinks this topic is interesting. I wonder what the implications are for their products
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:24.440]   So uh, valley edits on twitter at valley edits
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.960]   One of a whole set of these somebody should make a list of all of these
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:34.360]   Yeah, actually if you go to congress edits, uh, and look at who it's following it's following about 60 accounts right now
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.760]   and most of them are um
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.920]   Government trackers so you know government in germany, uh, what are the elected official editing?
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.840]   Uh, but there's for all different things. There's from certain universities from big tech companies
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:50.440]   There's one for uh pharmaceutical companies who are they who what are their employees editing on Wikipedia?
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:55.640]   Uh and this view into sort of directly who's uh editing the information
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.080]   I have found it's just a really it makes me wish I had it for everything
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:04.520]   Yeah, no kidding. I mean you can go into any google article and see who has edited it
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:11.080]   But by ip address you then have to would match it up to uh, yeah, I mean, it's it's it's always been theoretically possible
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.360]   The being able to really go in and just kind of have it a click it delivered to you
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:19.240]   Between congress edits in valley edits. It's been very very, uh, eye opening for me
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:26.600]   We are going to have kevin markson next week to talk about the in the web something. We're very intrigued by
