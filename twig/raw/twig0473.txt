[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.000]   Snapdragon Wear 3100 which I thought was kind of cool and then Stacey compared it to the new news of Apple's watch that they announced today and
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.160]   Maybe it sounded just a little bit less cool all that and a whole lot more coming up next on this week in Google

[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.160]   But I'm in it sitting here in the seat in his place Jason how I'm super happy to be here
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.400]   Have a lot of fun last week gonna have a lot of fun this week as well joining us Jeff Jarvis
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.000]   From hotel room somewhere in the world and we'll see how it goes
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.880]   Yes, I'm in Austin's like oh
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.960]   And that was a quick one
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.680]   Oh, but I like how it froze
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.920]   At least we got the the death freeze like at the very beginning of the show
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.160]   We weren't quite sure what was gonna happen there. I'm pretty sure it broke up for you to Jeff
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.760]   I'm turning on my phone try that too. All right. We'll try that Jeff's gonna work on that also joining us Stacy Higginbotham
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.520]   How you doing Stacy? It's great to see you again doing well also in Austin several no 13 miles 12 miles 10 miles 6 miles
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.880]   I don't know how far from Jeff
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.680]   Well, it's too bad that you didn't like go to where Jeff is so that you could use his internet there because it's amazing
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.960]   Yes, yes, I'm feeling bad that you know
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.400]   We were gonna have both of us here, but then I was like oh no you can make it at your hotel
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   You should do that you'll be more comfortable
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.680]   It's my fault. It's okay. Don't blame yourself
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   I blame the internet blame Skype because when things don't work. We just usually blame Skype
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.720]   That's the easy scapegoat and joining us
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   I'm super stoked about this because I haven't done a podcast with you in quite a while Kevin TOEFL about Chromebooks
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.600]   It has been way too long Jason I am so glad to be on a show with you again
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.720]   Yeah, man, it's good to see you and you've been busy with about Chromebooks.com and we've got well
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.040]   We've even got some of your stories in the rundown today
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.640]   We got a lot of Google to talk about as I was kind of going through beforehand
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.720]   You know a lot of Google and then unfortunately
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.960]   There's there's some politics stuff in there and I realized today like I think I'm I think I'm tired of politics
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.920]   Like I'm just beat down politics. Just keep happening. Why does it keep happening?
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.440]   Make it stop make it stop, but we can't because the the intersection of politics and technology
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.280]   It's it's unavoidable. It's undeniable. So we're gonna have to talk about some of this stuff
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.520]   But we don't need to start there
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.960]   Let's start with something that I saw a little bit earlier today that I'm sure we all have opinions on and this is
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.840]   Google's inbox product
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   inbox the alternative email product that Google rolled out not very long ago in the grand scheme of Google years
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.280]   But apparently they have plans to say goodbye and discontinue inbox
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.120]   This will happen at end of life will be next March. So are we disappointed? I'm disappointed
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.760]   I use it every single day. What about you guys?
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.280]   I'm okay with it. Yeah
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.000]   But mostly because I didn't use it very often. So I'm like oh
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.920]   All right, well because I thought they were gonna force us all to use it and I was like, okay
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.600]   I'll get used to it
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.840]   That's fine, but I didn't love it when I tried to use it
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.360]   So so you didn't use it very often because gmail was acceptable or are you using something else like I?
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.200]   Feel like when I go into gmail after using inbox. I feel like it's way too chaotic and there's just too much too much distraction there
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.240]   I like I guess
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.000]   Okay, so I used to be a die hard many many years ago outlook user like I was like master outlook
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.920]   I don't know why but I took a course at some point in time and was really good at it
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.520]   So the when I started working in gmail. I was like this is the worst
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.360]   Program ever I can't do anything. It's such a pain
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:46.120]   But I kind of just got used to it and now with inbox. I was like, oh, they're trying to bring back functionality that I used to have a decade ago
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.400]   But I didn't love it. I don't know why I just
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.680]   And maybe it was just change, but I don't freak out at my inbox more than usual
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.880]   I mean I do but it's just because there's like 13,000 unread messages. That's
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:09.800]   That's a thing at this point where we're just accepting the fact that we'll never be caught up as far as unread messages are concerned
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.480]   That that statistic at this point is completely like unnecessary information because it does me no good
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.440]   It's not like I'm at zero and now I'm at one so that that's useful information. It will always be a crazy number
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.760]   What a lot yeah, what about you Kevin?
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.440]   Yeah, well, I should preface this by saying most of Stacey's unread messages are for me. So it's okay
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.100]   I'm more upset about that. Yeah, no
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.360]   You know, it's funny because I was not a big inbox fan when it first came out in 2014 and in 2016
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.240]   I gave it another try and now I kind of feel like I can't live without it
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.320]   And I'm really I am sad about this and I know a lot of people are gonna be like well, it's a typical Google product
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.640]   You know, you never know how long something's gonna last
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.760]   Yes, and no, I mean this is they still have an email service. They're just changing, you know or reducing the options that we have for clients
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   And it kind of stinks
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.720]   But I hope they don't get bashed too much over this although I am I am disappointed
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:15.200]   Yeah, I mean they've obviously they've taken some of the features of inbox and kind of brought them over to Gmail
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   They did a very big update to Gmail within the last couple of months that really seemed to be the biggest example of this
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.520]   And this was the story back at the time when those changes happen, which was like, okay
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.920]   Well now inbox is becoming less
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.880]   Less its own thing and now it's sharing these key features with Gmail its days might be numbered
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.560]   Obviously its days were numbered
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.920]   But inbox also kind of acted as a really great proving ground for a lot of these features does Google run a risk by
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.200]   then not having that that kind of playground for these ideas and
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.740]   Having to use Gmail with its insane user base
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:59.280]   As the testing ground I guess it's no different than than A/B testing, you know or beta testing anything any of their products
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.360]   Well, they still have Google Labs, right? Yeah, I mean, I think so do they is is there still Google Labs embedded in Gmail?
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.360]   I imagine I have labs things running unless they turned into mainstream stuff. So I'm gonna sue yes
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.600]   Now I'm looking at me -
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.520]   And frankly we're all in Google's playground anyway, I mean they can do whatever they want they always do and
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.720]   Sometimes for the better and sometimes not so I don't think it's an issue
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.960]   I mean again
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.840]   I think some people might be upset because they really liked the features
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.280]   But Jason you're absolutely right
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   I use a lot of the like the smart replies and other things they were dog-fooded internally at Google where I use them first
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.800]   Then they went out to every you know all the inbox users and then eventually made it over to to Gmail
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:49.040]   So I think it's fine. We're not gonna miss out on any new features. Yeah, I'm just gonna have to get used to Gmail again
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:57.080]   It I end up logging into it randomly and I'm just my brain is so tuned into how inbox treats everything that it's gonna
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.880]   Take me some time. I'm just gonna need a little time you guys
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:06.360]   You could always use an Android app on your on your Chromebook for that you could stay so you could use outlook on a
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.240]   Chromebook or a Chromebook I am aware I could I have I have gone passed outlook. I'm okay with it
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.760]   On you well, so this is an interesting question Kevin because I mean obviously, you know
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.720]   Chrome Chrome OS is a really big focus of what you're spending a lot of time with right now
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:32.520]   Do you on a Chromebook do you opt for an Android app for your email client or do you just go into the browser and tear into there?
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:40.280]   I go into the browser these days just because that's the thing. I've done the longest, you know for 10 years practically hard
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.520]   It is hard to undo that
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:49.680]   But I mean you do have options and hey if there's a good Linux client that you want to use you can do that on most modern Chromebooks
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.040]   As they roll out project Christina, so there's we've got multiple options. Yeah
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.440]   That's true
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:03.000]   But you can go ahead and put this in the box next to Google product that you know was introduced not too long ago
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   But now is going away
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.920]   Google at this point. It's no surprise that Google does this. It's yeah Google Plus is still
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.360]   alive and kick it
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.200]   Yeah, that's true
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.520]   That's true. I mean there are there's there's plenty of people
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:24.360]   Contributing to the Google Plus community who would argue like like there's a reason for it to be there
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.760]   You know that that it's unique and what it offers man
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.840]   I my habit has completely fallen off the edge of a cliff. I don't even check it anymore rarely. I should say
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.400]   Wait, did we get rid of Jeff entirely? Did that happen? Yeah, so okay
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.260]   It's been very spotty as you can see there's no longer three monitors
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:53.760]   Surrounding me there is to although I think we might have connected with him. Let's just say that we won't bank on Jeff's
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:02.080]   Ability to contribute on the show, but when he comes in we'll we'll say I just like how we like just totally faded him away with nothing
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:08.520]   I'm like oh wait a second. We've been there before the the Skype monsters are nothing new here in the studio
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.680]   But we do have him. Can we hear you right now Jeff?
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.720]   Or maybe there I think one two three four five. Yeah
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   one two three one two three five
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.880]   So far so good you don't see him on the set, but I guarantee you he's there welcome back Jeff
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:31.240]   Oh, we just we can't look directly at him
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.520]   Maybe if we look away things will be okay
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.880]   Yeah, I
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.000]   I'm not sure it's gonna work Jeff as much as I really want to have you on this podcast
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.400]   It's okay. Yeah, enjoy yourself. You're an Austin live it up a little bit
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.520]   You don't need to do this Google today
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.960]   Well, dude, bro. I love you guys. Oh, we've been loving you
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:09.880]   Are you are you on next week? Let's take a look at the schedule looking forward
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:15.880]   It looks like you will be in next week so you can redeem yourself if you need to drop off today. We understand
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   All right, I think yeah, so yeah, I don't think it's gonna work man
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.120]   so we will talk to you enjoy your case so enjoy the rest of your time in Austin and
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   We'll have plenty to talk about with you next week
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.840]   Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate it. Oh
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.920]   Right, so
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.960]   No one seems to be too sad about inbox. Maybe me a little bit, but that's okay. I think I'll probably get over it
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.320]   Why don't we talk pixel because we actually did get some pretty
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.720]   Solid concrete news as concrete as it gets from Google that there will be a pixel three event
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:58.960]   Or we assume it's a pixel three event anyways an event of some sort is happening officially on October 9th
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.080]   So Google has made that the date. I love New York is the tagline
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:11.880]   They say there will be a live stream begins at 11 a.m. Eastern 8 a.m. Pacific if you can't be at the New York event
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.160]   Which most people probably will not be there?
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.000]   There's also an event happening
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.200]   I guess in France French publications got an invite for an event. I love Paris
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.600]   That happens at the same time as the New York event. So so hey
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.900]   Isn't that weird that they would do that they'd time them the same
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:36.840]   Happen in there. It's gonna be like the unveiling of a Beyonce video, but it's a Google video featuring the Louv
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.240]   Who knows
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.000]   well actually
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.320]   was the pixel available in
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.560]   Paris or in France at launch last year. I'm very curious to know that
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.480]   This is all I'm gonna say because I'm not allowed to say anything. Oh, okay
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:03.160]   So you all sorts of questions you can ask as many questions as you like I will never stop you from asking questions. However, however
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:10.960]   Keep in mind as you first said, this is not necessarily a pixel three event. This is really a made by Google event
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.760]   Yeah, yeah, so yes, we all assume there will be a pixel
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:21.080]   Three pixel three XL. We've also seen rumors of a new chrome cast. We've also talked about or heard about
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.600]   pixel book replacements
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.920]   so
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.840]   it may be
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.440]   Things that are important in France. That's all I can say. Okay. That makes sense cheese
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.040]   Google branded cheese and wine
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.200]   Google berry's yes
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.320]   No
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.840]   Well, Kevin's gonna be at the event correct Kevin
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:51.960]   I'm going to France first and I'm leer jetting over. No. Yes. I will be in I'll be in New York City for the event
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   Yes, I
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.840]   Was hoping you parachute into one of the events, but I'm actually not Google glass -
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.320]   Logistically, that's that's difficult to make happen. I understand. Yeah, okay
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:10.280]   So that's an important distinction made by Google is I think the hashtag that they're using in you know conjunction with this announcement
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.760]   And obviously Google makes a whole lot more than just pixel phones
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:20.640]   But we have been seeing a lot of leaks a lot of information happening here and there and whether it's trusted
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.720]   information or not
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.280]   remains to be proven from the event
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:32.760]   Are either of you I think we talked a little bit about this last week Stacey on the show, but Kevin
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.800]   Are you at all excited like are you do you think that if there is a new pixel phone?
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.200]   And based on what you've seen from the leaks is that something that you're probably gonna pick up?
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:48.400]   So yeah, I mean, I think the the leaks I can't see why they wouldn't be legit first of all
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.400]   I think what's exciting is
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.120]   what
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.980]   software
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:59.800]   Services and things like Google optimizes for the pixel and I I think back to the camera software last year and even the year before that
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:06.080]   Which you're just blowing almost everything else out of the water. So I'm excited to see all that for sure me personally
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:13.800]   I'm kind of in a budget mode now that I'm getting older. So I'm literally sticking with my Nokia
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.920]   $324 Nokia 7 Plus
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.560]   Personally nice and how are you having loves that phone? Yeah?
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.680]   You know, I do I do love this phone. I know we want to talk about pixel, but I will just say I mean
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:31.900]   $324 it is an international model. You cannot get it here. This ship from Taiwan via Amazon
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.280]   Doesn't support all of the US LTE bands. I make do it works fine
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.600]   but you know for you could buy what three pixels for the price of this essentially and
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:49.960]   It's got a fantastic camera. It's got a Snapdragon 660, which yes, it's a mid-range chip, but it still is really
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.640]   solid-performing and
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.720]   Easily you can go a day and a half if not two days on a charge
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.200]   It's running the Android 9 pi beta because it's an Android one phone
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.680]   So it's always going to get the latest updates the software. I
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.480]   Best $324 I spent in years. Wow
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.320]   That's awesome
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:15.080]   I mean and getting the updates being an Android one phone. That's you know that ends up being a lot of people's kind of instant
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.920]   instant point when you're going off the the pixel
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.760]   You know direction is so yeah
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:27.120]   Well, what about updates? But obviously Google's done a really good job with Android one of bringing this to more devices and
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:34.960]   That's I would say one of the key kind of standout features of getting an Android one device would be that the software support
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.320]   Which is so important
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.220]   Do you worry about?
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.000]   security buying see it's the HTC honor
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.760]   something something do you worry about like I
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.880]   Guess malicious content on your phones since you had to buy it from Amazon and it was shipped from Taiwan
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.040]   Well, just about every phone these days is made over in that area or that region
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:01.240]   So I mean what you know the last pixel. I'm sure was built in China as well
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.680]   Would I would I go for an a Huawei as ETE?
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.440]   Maybe not as much for that reason, but I'm not too concerned about about that
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.760]   I mean I got to believe that the Google's hardware partners are doing what they're supposed to be doing or Google
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   Or they wouldn't be Google hardware partners, right?
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.640]   So the perfect example the Google Titan security key it's made in China
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.720]   You know I bought one
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.680]   So do you bought one do you have it yet? Have you been using it?
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.360]   I do have it and I'm setting it up either tonight or tomorrow morning
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.080]   Okay, I'm kind of giving a prelude to my thing at the end of the show. Oh, okay. We won't go there
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.940]   Talking pretend that I said nothing. Let's let's just move on
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.000]   so
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.560]   One of the things that's been kind of happening over the past the course of the last week
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.920]   like obviously there were the there were the leaks that
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:59.200]   Around the pixel devices that we heard a lot about and they were like appearing on on YouTube on all these like Russian
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.640]   Review sites and everything really highly produced
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.560]   Reviews of these devices that Google literally has not announced yet
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.520]   And so what is that kind of led to at this point? It's led to a lot of conspiracy
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:20.880]   Theories as far as like what exactly is going on people are wondering are these actually the devices?
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.720]   Personally, I think they are and if they are not
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:30.360]   Who's behind them? Maybe Google is feeding like anyways the conspiracy theory says
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:38.760]   Maybe Google is feeding these devices out there to steer people into a certain direction and then be able to show on stage
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.680]   Hey, you know that thing ha ha fool fools
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.240]   This is the actual device and don't you love it sounds a little far-fetched?
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.280]   But apparently there's a lot of people that believe that this is actually happening and I don't understand how that could possibly
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.960]   Be reality. I don't think are they upset about the notch and this is their way to deny it for a little longer. I think so
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.440]   Okay, that's a part of it
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.160]   Because people are like really upset about the notch on this phone
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.440]   Like hatefully so to the point of like I would normally get the largest most specked out phone
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.560]   But I'm not going to this time. No, I'm gonna get the smaller one because not
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:18.160]   Two things this is like a non cue except it's a non G. You know, it's it's a Google conspiracy
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:27.920]   Listen the notch on the on the iPhone 10 that was leaked well in advance and people thought it was hideous die-hard apple people
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.720]   Saying I'll never buy this phone. Guess what? It didn't hurt sales. Not at all
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:39.280]   And and if and I don't know honestly if that is the the size of the notch on the pixel 3 XL
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.600]   I don't think it's gonna hurt that many sales either. Yes, there will be people who say and not getting it
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   That's fine, but by and large it'll be fine
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.720]   Secondly about three maybe four weeks ago when all these leaks started
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.360]   There was a prominent youtube blogger who does phone reviews
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:02.880]   He was contacted allegedly by the somebody in Russia and says I want to sell you this for $2,000 thinking your page views
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.640]   So what this guy did instead of buying it he went through the whole
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.880]   Information process to figure out if he was going to do this with the guy it was
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.160]   Really shady partly on telegram part lay on twitter dms and all that and he
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.960]   Recorded it all on his youtube video and this went on for like a day or two
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:27.040]   And he condensed it to eight 10 minutes. I mean everything he has no reason to lie. I don't think
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:34.400]   Um, he was exposing that these phones might have been stolen off the production line or something and somebody was trying to sell them for $2,000 and
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:41.120]   Honestly, I think these leaks are the legit thing because of that. I don't think there's any conspiracy here
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.600]   I just don't yeah, well some of these uh youtube
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:53.600]   Channels that have been you know doing their reviews or at least responding reacting to the leaks that are out there and saying oh well
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.920]   This is ugly because it's got the notch or whatever
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.480]   Apparently they're now being contacted by someone who represents google
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.880]   Saying hey, we would like the rights to play some of your content for an upcoming event
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.560]   And that's I think where the conspiracy theories began where it's like wait a minute
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:16.800]   So google wants like did they feed these out there so that we would respond negatively so that they could pull our content in
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.520]   And then you know display how everybody was so wrong because here's the right thing
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:28.320]   And I think that's a really long way to go for some sort of marketing blitz that I think also has the potential
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.600]   To be very negative for your brand if people like immediately at that point decide oh well
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.880]   You know not knowing that google may have put the put out this fake phone go well
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:44.000]   That's not the phone that I'm hoping for i'm gonna buy a note nine right now and you know they lose a sale
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.320]   So I just don't see any company like google
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.080]   Actually doing that it seems like a long way to go for something like that
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.600]   It's it's not in their dna either. It's just not what they do. Yeah, we could i'm sick
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.880]   I could be wrong, but yeah, I think more more likely if if google is reaching out to these people
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.320]   it's probably
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.080]   To the point of like, you know, I could see them on stage being like and
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   We making making light of the fact that they weren't able to keep the secret very long, you know, and you all
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.320]   Idea what what we have in store, you know, i'm playing a little montage or something. I don't know
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:25.680]   But anyways, i'm excited for the phones the notch isn't offensive to me necessarily it is to a lot of people though
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.760]   so we'll see um, but
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.680]   Kevin we need to talk to you because a big part of this made by google event
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.440]   is
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.320]   Is pixel books or something along these lines?
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.040]   Chrome OS tablets
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.120]   detachable tablets all sorts of things it seems like there's a lot of kind of
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.800]   Possibilities here and again, there's leaks involved
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.400]   Uh with this as well. So what can you tell me about kind of?
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.040]   I don't know the the leaks that we've seen so far. We've seen some ad leaks and that sort of stuff
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.360]   What what's kind of on the on the line there?
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:03.040]   I'm at a loss. I haven't seen or heard anything. Oh wait a minute. So this is the thing that I can't ask you about
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.520]   No, i'm kidding. Wait a minute. You wrote about this stuff. Of course i can ask you about it. I was like
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.960]   He's fallen for it. Good job. I was like, uh
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:18.400]   Yes, yes, yes, um, so yeah, there's there's lots of potential things that we will see
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.600]   Um, I guess I mean and some of these things we've been talking about about chrome books since
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:32.400]   I think may because I I scour the chromium commit log every day twice a day, you know, because that's what normal people do
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   right and
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.960]   I had first heard for example of the code name knock turn as a
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.440]   Chromebook board back in may and the fact that it would have pogo pins
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:52.000]   um leading to the potential for a snap-on keyboard similar to say a surface pro or an ipad pro
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.440]   Right. Um, don't know if they're going to do that, but I do strongly suspect. Yes. We will see a detachable chromebook
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.840]   but what about pixel book so
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.640]   lately we have seen some ads
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.280]   showing up in google ads facebook ads and then in a youtube tv
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.280]   video spot
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.920]   Showing a pixel book that looks like today's
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.800]   Except for one key thing it has much smaller bezels and that does
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:24.880]   That makes sense to me because they're going google has spent an enormous amount of time
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.760]   on getting tablet
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:36.240]   Functionality to chromo s this year. I mean every day I see new changes of making chint making improvements to add
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.760]   You know hiding the shelf and tablet mode and all kinds of things
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.160]   So the pixel book two is what i'm calling and I don't know what it's going to be called
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.120]   But it should be more tablet-like and that it has smaller bezels
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.480]   I suspect the screen will actually be bigger because I have a feeling they'll just reuse the same chassis that they have today
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:59.280]   to flip out the the screen that flips over to maybe a 13 inch high res display and
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:07.040]   I anticipate they'll upgrade the chips inside too the until eighth gen processors for example. It just seems to make sense
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.440]   So
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.240]   We could see two things there, you know, and there's others in the works. There's atlas. That's a 4k
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.040]   board that supports chromo s. There's
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.320]   Cheza, which is a snap dragon 845
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:27.600]   Chromebook with lte and I know that project hermies is part of their e-sim support in chromo s so
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:34.240]   Geez, I mean for me this is almost like a pixel book event not a pixel three of that right right pixel family
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.560]   Yeah, and this would be I mean if they have multiple
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:43.760]   Uh pixel books coming out. That's a that's a really big deal. Um, and i'm happy he said lte even though uh jeff is not here
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.880]   But that would make him happy. I think that make him feel all warm and fuzzy to hear that
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.960]   Uh, because he's been waiting so long, but yeah, i'm looking at my my pixel book
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.240]   And I don't know if it's if it's possible to take the over the shoulder shot
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.960]   But based on what you were showing in those in those the the screen shot from the ad
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.240]   I mean these bezels i just jine normus compared to what you see
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.880]   in that ad so um
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.640]   Yeah, I think it makes perfect sense for it to fit inside of the the design of the current pixel book
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.240]   But just stretch the screen out. Yeah, I mean, I think that's the biggest
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.200]   Complaint that people have about the pixel book. It's not the performance or the internals or the battery life
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.160]   They're like, oh those bezels and yeah, there's a picture right there. You can see that they are
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:32.800]   Legally, um like a third of the size at least on the top and the left and the right now on the bottom
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.880]   It may still be a little bit bigger. I'm wondering though. Where does the front camera go?
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.560]   Right. Maybe there's a notch right out of the screen
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.360]   It's very not very possible. We can have a notch in the in the laptop
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.080]   For pixel book excel. Yeah
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.200]   Could possibly happen I you know, hey, I would not be surprised
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.280]   Uh at this point if people want the the bezel list that's that seems to be a big part of the trade-off
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:06.160]   That they're getting I should also point out that I feel like I have specific memories somewhere in the last couple of years
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.800]   Of google having some sort of promotional
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.720]   Stuff that either appeared inside of a you know an ad on a mobile device or somewhere
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.040]   That seemed to show a device. It was a handheld if I remember correctly
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:25.680]   That we had never seen before and everybody went nuts going because it was close enough to the event when nuts going oh
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:32.000]   Isn't google clever? They're putting their upcoming device in these in these ads and you know, no one's going to notice
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.320]   But of course we do we know they're going to release something this is probably it and that turned out to be false
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.800]   It did not turn out to actually represent anything
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.560]   So it's very possible that google's marketing team just takes
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.160]   Some of their ip and tweaks it around and make it more appealing in the ad and maybe that's not the new laptop
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.240]   But we we know that
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.840]   We're pretty high likelihood that there's new uh chromebooks coming based on all of the different types of leaks
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.760]   It's not just that one thing so yeah, there's there's one other aspect as well
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.880]   And that is at least if you subscribe to the fact that the google ad for this new pixel book or showing the new pixel book
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.680]   Um is true. It said affordable
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.960]   And they may have been talking about chromebooks in general. However high end chromebooks we know are a thousand bucks or so
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:23.440]   I'm wondering I don't I just don't know that google can come out with a pixel book replacement at the same pricing
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:31.680]   And I say that because they're partners del linovo and asir have all come out with like core i5
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.960]   8th gen intel powered chromebooks of late
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.840]   Starting at like 599
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.800]   I'm going to go out on a limb and say we see at least a $200 reduction in the base pixel book
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.520]   Um, that's just my gut. I don't know
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.240]   And I get one for that. Yeah, right?
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.680]   Well, and I think that's been a that's been a limiting factor for a lot of people yet when it comes down to chromo
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.880]   At least in my experience. This is the best one out there having the pixel book form factor
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:06.480]   It feels right, you know what I mean like so many of the other chromeless tablets that i've used
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.200]   They just they they feel wrong in certain ways either the touch the touch pad is
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.160]   Is not right or the display is not high enough resolution for
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.600]   You know it to be appealing to my eyes or the build quality feels hollow or something along those lines
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.720]   This feels right, but you also pay a lot for it and that ends up being the the trick for a lot of people is
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.360]   Why would I pay that much for a web only device and?
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.400]   I don't know. I think I think google's done a better job over the over the last couple of years
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.320]   Of convincing or making people understand why chroma o s
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.920]   Isn't
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:48.080]   Making a choice for something where you're sacrificing other things where it actually has its own value and it's worth it
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:53.920]   A $200 reduction in price that makes it even even better. That would be a that would be a big deal. I think
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:01.520]   Or well, I hope i'm right, but yeah, also as you just alluded to you know, it's it's a lot of money for you know
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.280]   A browser, but what has google done and it took a while to get there
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.600]   Android apps have been added so now you've got a mobile app experience if you'd like
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.640]   Um just about everything comes with a touchscreen these days, which makes the mobile app experience much better
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:21.840]   You've also got project christini on a lot of chromebooks that have been out or that rolled out in the past year
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.640]   So now you have full linux apps. Yes, it's still in beta, but it's it's getting there
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:32.880]   And then there's this talk of the or there's code saying we're gonna be able to boot into an alt o s
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.560]   So there's a a third option there that makes a chromebook more compelling
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.680]   And I I don't know if you guys realize what alt o s is
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:47.600]   Well, so is this the windows on a crona pixel book or a chromos sort of thing like a dual boot sort of thing like boot camp on
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.000]   Undays of old on mac
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.760]   Essentially, yes, that's that's what it would be so so there may be opportunity to install other
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.200]   uh
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.600]   Other platforms on there. Maybe you want the full linux install in a dual boot situation
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.720]   As opposed to using linux in a container with christini
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.600]   But yeah, so now you think about it. I mean
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.960]   And I think maybe mike elkham was on your show a couple weeks back and was saying hey, you know
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.080]   the chromebook is like the
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.000]   Uh, it went from running no software to running more software than any other platform
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.760]   And now you add windows to the mix and and I he's right
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.920]   Big big change
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   but that might be the the
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:38.560]   That might be the hurdle that people are willing to jump over in order to get into here because then it increases the perceived value of the actual
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:43.680]   Hardware itself if you can put something that you know, most people would consider a full fledge
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.340]   uh
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:52.320]   Operating system onto this hardware and have the choice of dual boot that that could be the the reason people decide to finally jump
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.000]   So
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Stacy can go back to outlook?
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.640]   Do you have a that that was decades ago you guys?
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:06.400]   Never let you live that down. Do you do you have a pixel book right now? Stacy or what?
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.760]   What is your laptop?
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.200]   My laptop is a macbook air, so it's old but
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:17.360]   Yeah, and I really don't know what to do because I've got to replace the air with something soon
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.280]   and
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.800]   The latest macbooks. I'm still not I don't love the keyboard
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.400]   I know they've fixed the they break all the time, but I really hated feel the feel of it. So I'm like oh
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.120]   Now what do I do?
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.120]   Those clacky flat keys
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.360]   Hate those. Yeah, my wife has that laptop and it's just so weird when I type on it
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.720]   Maybe it's the kind of thing you get used to over time, but I just don't like the feel of it. I completely agree
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.920]   All right, let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode of this week in google
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:55.200]   And then we'll get back into more google news this week and google is brought to you by grammerly

[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.800]   All right, uh, let's see here
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:21.520]   Go up to the top here and start running through some of this google stuff. We got alphabet
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.640]   uh
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.240]   Alphabet's loon
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.120]   Which is no longer a project. It's not project loon anymore. It's evolved
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.280]   Apparently it hit a new milestone actually a very important milestone
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:41.040]   Last month and it's all about how much distance they can cover with these with these uh internet balloons essentially
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.320]   1000 kilometers of data covering distance between seven of its balloons
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   That's their new record prior to this
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.360]   The record was 100 kilometers across two balloons
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.720]   And even if you kind of stay locked into the two balloon
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:00.080]   Aspect of the prior record loon also surpassed that 100 kilometer record
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.280]   Uh up to 600 kilometers now that's the longest point to point so far
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.960]   So they're expanding the capabilities wider coverage with you know a minimal amount of these
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.880]   internet balloons
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.200]   Floating around in the year and this is all important because there are plans to charge for the service
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.680]   Starting next year. I think I just kind of forgot that loon was happening
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.640]   At the actually send them to porta rico
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.160]   Was that a thing that I imagined or was that facebook's effort?
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.760]   Uh, well google suggest google that
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:38.000]   I know I think you're right. Yeah delivers internet to 100 000 people in porta rico. November of last year
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.440]   I mean, it's a small country, but but still still like it's it's real country. Yeah
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.080]   Wait, sorry
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.760]   It's a US territory territory. What do we call those?
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.040]   Uh, no, I got it wrong
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:57.680]   It's a US territory. Yes territory. Okay. I was like it's not a state
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.640]   It's not a country. It's a not a province
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:08.320]   But it has internet thanks to uh, thanks to loon. Yeah, I guess I just kind of forgot that that loon was active
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.040]   I think uh, i've gotten used to google killing
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:16.400]   Killing killing its projects. I just kind of assumed maybe they had done that with project loon
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.520]   Well facebook killed their internet sky project. Um, the one that's
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.480]   Acella acella acella something
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.000]   The big planes with a horrible name. Yeah
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.520]   Um, i'm sure it has the word cell in it. Yes
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.840]   Somewhere
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.600]   But yeah, that's good. It's an uh, important kind of milestone. I think
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:43.840]   Uh, does it in every it's a 10x milestone and technologists love their 10x milestones. Oh sure
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.320]   But they should call me when it's in miles
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.760]   Otherwise or nothing wait a minute. Let's do the conversion here
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.400]   610
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:58.240]   Yeah, I mean it's still fine, but you're welcome. It's it's like a 10k. It just times 100
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:05.680]   So right right six point one. Does anybody know the speed of the internet speed? I realize it's to blanket swaths of coverage
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.160]   I'm just curious. I mean
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.560]   You know, they probably don't
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.440]   Offer too much, but it'd be curious what they offer in terms of actual speeds. Is it like 2g3g or?
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.960]   Uh
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.480]   The so the
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:24.000]   Did a search for this and this is from august of last year. It says up to 10 megabits per second
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.800]   um
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.400]   And this was between balloons over 100 kilometers apart
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:37.120]   Uh, so around 10 megabits per second or up to rather so obviously that fluctuates, but
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.320]   That'll get you a bit for glte speeds
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.160]   basically
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.160]   Yeah, it'll get you youtube, uh
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.160]   Might have might have some issues and latency and stuff like that. I imagine but
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.080]   But yeah, that's totally usable
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.520]   Mm-hmm. Meanwhile 5g is totally right around the corner. Uh, it seems like down here borizon actually
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.880]   And they have an announcement of 5g announcement. They're gonna be offering 5g home brought broadband
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.880]   This year
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:09.520]   They opened up sales for it. Yes. They had announced it a while back and now they're saying you can buy it
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.160]   Wow, which if you're into that
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.240]   Yay
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.400]   If you're into that sort of thing fast internet
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.280]   Well, kevin and i actually talked about this
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.520]   Um, the challenges with 5g because it is using millimeter wave band is
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:30.560]   Weather can cause some issues with it now verizon and other companies doing these types of things have tested it
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.960]   But I think kevin you compared it to like
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.120]   satellite
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.880]   When we talked about last
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.800]   Right you could face similar challenges. I mean I remember when I had a satellite dish and
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   You know, you had a bad storm
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.960]   That was it, you know, you could the signal could go in and go out and so on
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.000]   So I don't know how they're going to mitigate that with line of slight millimeter wave
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.760]   Right
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.920]   They could have they could have trees with wind in the way. I it's going to be a challenge
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:02.160]   Yeah, I mean even near term like I'm not sure that you know what the
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.200]   what the hardware is going to be like
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   Hitting the home broadband areas, but when you're talking about like what we're seeing in mobile and what we kind of saw
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.400]   With motoral his phone that has the motor mod with the 5g and
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.520]   Looked all sorts of funky and that's because of these
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.520]   These issues, right? It creates a lot of bulk adds all these weird antennas sticking out the side
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:29.360]   So it's it's a long way to go for improved speeds, but there's a lot of asterisks involved along the way
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:36.160]   So they're going to put devices on people's rofs rofs rofs rofs. I don't know how people say that word
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.120]   On top of their houses. Okay. Um, and then that'll tie into that a link to a
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.200]   Device or a gateway device in the home
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:48.640]   So that's that's how that technology is going to look all right
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.840]   into a box
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:59.120]   Someone yeah, what we're all used to seeing so then it's just a matter of line aside from the antenna or whatever it is mounted on the the roof
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.600]   I think I say roof
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:08.000]   roof roof roof roof roof roof. I don't know it's apparently I say drawers funny too. So I
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.480]   Do say drawers
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.960]   I don't know where I'm getting all this so I'm like I
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.880]   Well, though it's spelled drawers. So that makes sense
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.520]   I would say drawers
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.320]   Who knows?
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:30.160]   Okay. Anyway, I love this show. I love how going from 5g to how you how you pronounce drawers
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.040]   Um
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.080]   Exactly anything is on the table here. Um, let's see here
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.720]   Do that was uh
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.920]   Carnegie melons Andrew more so basically
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:53.280]   We've seen that google's had a lot of challenges in the past year project maven and the department of defense contracts with ai and everybody internally saying hey
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:01.040]   This should not be happening. You know our ai should not be developed to potentially be weaponized or used in some you know
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.360]   in those sorts of ways
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:10.480]   Um, so obviously google's kind of ai research team has had a lot of a lot of setbacks and turns out there's going to be some
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.240]   A little bit of a change. I don't know if the change is necessarily directly related to
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.480]   These issues. I think it was planned all along but they're bringing back Andrew more
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:25.600]   Uh to head the division by the end of the year more has been the dean of computer science at Carnegie melon university although
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.600]   I always want to say meligan
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.440]   But Carnegie meligan
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.880]   melon university
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:36.560]   Uh for the past four years fae fae lee who's the current head of google cloud ai is going to return to stanford
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:42.960]   To head the ai lab there after two years with google so it's almost like they're they're chan they're passing
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.680]   And passing a night. Yes
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.480]   To improve the the ai development, uh at google
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:55.120]   Semi related and I just noticed this before the show
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.400]   Um
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:04.320]   About a year and a half ago google consolidated all of its product blogs and put them into what they call the keyword which is at blog.google
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:09.360]   I noticed today that they're moving the cloud
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:15.520]   Pieces back off to a separate area at cloud.google.com/blog
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.400]   So I think if you go to blog.google right now, you'll see this announcement
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.840]   Um because I saw it earlier today and I find that really odd
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:30.000]   That they consolidated everything and now cloud they brought cloud in and now clouds going back out
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.720]   Because it's such a big part of what they're trying to do to grow their business. Oh, yeah
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:41.280]   Introducing the google cloud blog. There you go our new home for cloud news guides and stories
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.080]   Um
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.880]   Man, they've got a got a lot of content hitting these pages
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:52.560]   Yep, that's impressive. I mean this is like 10 posts today
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.600]   That's crazy. Um
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.720]   Yeah, I don't know what I don't know what to add to the day. I think but yes
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.480]   I think that might be all we have on that one
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.920]   Uh
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.320]   I think you know honestly, I think i've just been kind of avoiding the next one to be completely honest
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.480]   There was a there was a story that broke right before uh right before the show
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.360]   About uh bright barts
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.960]   Essentially has posted a link to a video
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.360]   leaked video
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.720]   Uh says the verge article of google's first all hands meeting after the 2016 election
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.920]   There's been a big kind of movement right now. Um big conservative
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.800]   Leading movement saying that oh well google is obviously so
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:43.360]   So liberal and as a company culture that this is
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.280]   You know possibly or probably in in some people's views
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.560]   Influencing how they operate their business google's pushing back pretty hard on that
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:57.920]   Accusation but bright bard posted this uh this leaked video
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:03.600]   And it's the all hands meeting that happened immediately after the 2016 election and in it
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.240]   You know co-founder segabrin
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:11.440]   Says things like you know finding finding the uh election very offensive
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.480]   He says quote and I know many of you do too
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.120]   Uh conflicts with many of our values. I think it's a good time to reflect on that
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.960]   Uh so many people apparently don't share the values that we have
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.040]   And so
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:32.240]   You know this this really seems to kind of tie into uh the narrative that that is being uh kind of
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.440]   Hashed out publicly right now in conservative circles
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:43.040]   What do you guys think? I mean, I personally I feel like a lot of companies probably had similar conversations
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:50.080]   But a lot of the of other companies aren't google and don't have the power that google has potentially over
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.720]   So many people because of its search engine and all of its products, but what do you guys think?
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.680]   Oh, I'll go first go for it. You don't want to talk about the ceiling
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:06.720]   I'm like, uh, well, I was also answering a question in the chat room about Verizon line of sight and doing some research on uh blocking of
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.840]   um
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.680]   Spectrum capacity stuff, but that was a fun topic. I get it
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   I'm like, hey, let's talk about spectral propagation
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Quick change of talking
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.560]   Okay, right, bert. I'm ready
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.640]   Yeah, but Kevin you go first
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:28.800]   I'll go first and I'll disclose. I'm not affiliate with any party never have been and probably never will be um, am I dismayed by the election?
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.920]   Yes, I'm not thrilled with it, but it is what it is. It's over him and whatever
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.840]   I agree, Jason. I think there are a lot of companies that probably had
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.800]   meetings like this there probably companies that had meetings like this when barak obama was elected
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.760]   And that's within their right to do so. I don't have a problem with that
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:52.800]   You know, my my thing is if if bright part has this beef and this video and is going to push to have this looked into
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.880]   I'm all for everybody following the rules when it comes to, you know, uh financial
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:02.400]   election donations and so on and so forth. I wasn't at this meeting so I can't speak to it
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.520]   But you know bring your evidence and let the chips fall where they may I say and then that goes for either way
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.280]   Like I said, I'm sure there were companies in 2008 that felt this way as well
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.960]   Are they google no so point taken that they're big company. It's a big company with a lot of power. Yes
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   Um, so prove that there was something wrong and when I see proof, I'll certainly believe it and say that's wrong
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:28.480]   And there's no secret that this was a very polarizing election and
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.200]   Based on the stories it talks about like sundar pachai telling people that
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:39.040]   You know, they were upset and he was saying hey if you're afraid of the consequences of a trump administration
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:46.240]   I get that talk to people if he really said, you know, reach out to political opponents and embrace an democratic process
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.200]   That's not exactly a call to arms against trump
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:54.560]   That's saying get off your lazy butts and start participating in the political process if you don't like what what just happened
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:59.280]   I don't I don't think that's a terrible thing to do and
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.480]   I mean
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.360]   I'm I struggled with this election. Um, and I was at
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:14.480]   I actually know I wasn't was I still there? I don't I was like, I don't even remember where I was it was so traumatizing but
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.040]   the point is
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.200]   after every election
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.200]   people
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.200]   tend to like
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   People have feelings about it and it's fine to acknowledge that and after this last election. I think people had
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.680]   really deep feelings that maybe they didn't have beforehand and
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:45.360]   I think that's more of a response to where our politics are today than it is of a particular candidate, but that's just me and I I mean
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.920]   or a company or a company and I think it's despicable that
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.320]   There are publications and partisanship trying to make
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.600]   What are human reactions to these things?
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:03.680]   Using that is this to just increasingly inflame this war
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.720]   between two sides. It's
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:12.400]   I do. I think it's despicable. That is all. I think we could do better and
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:17.360]   Would be smarter without inflaming so much aggregate vation and
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.640]   Whatnot?
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.280]   So yeah, that's that's such the uh
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.720]   It's so indicative of of this moment in time
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:31.280]   from a political perspective is there's so much of this going on. It's so hard to uh
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.880]   So hard to try and ignore that, you know, that certainly doesn't make me feel
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.880]   It makes me feel icky the more the more I kind of dwell in
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:46.720]   The the state of all this stuff right now and yeah, but I will say if it bothers you guys
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:53.040]   Do go out and do something about it. Talk to your neighbors. You know go vote actually
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.320]   do things to improve it and
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.760]   I again, I don't think that's a partisan message. I think you know like I
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:06.480]   There was an advice column of a couple days back. I think it was someone saying
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   Oh, I volunteered to take my neighbor to the polls for election day
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.560]   And I know she's gonna work
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:17.040]   conservatively or for someone I don't like can I just tell her I can't take her
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.160]   And rightly so the person giving advice was like no, that's a jerk move and
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.680]   You know, you you should engage with them and talk to them about
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.160]   You know talk about your point of view here and see what happens, but so
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.360]   Yeah, we're all just toast. Okay. I'm done
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:38.480]   We're all just hosed title. That's my considered opinion
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:44.000]   All right, well, I'll see if I can maybe uh, maybe steer us in in
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.720]   More, I don't know enjoyable topics here in fact, let's let's take a break
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:54.240]   Well, thank you sponsor and then we'll come back and we'll talk about some maybe less politically charged
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.760]   More enjoyable topics. This episode of this week in google is brought to you
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:04.880]   Uh by the reason that I show up to work all bright eyed and bushy tailed and that is castor because I have castor mattress
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:12.160]   Let me tell you it's super comfortable. Caspor is an online retailer a premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.840]   Uh
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.200]   If you haven't checked it out for yourself, they're revolutionizing the mattress industry
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.280]   They're cutting the cost of dealing with resailors
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.880]   And showrooms and passing that savings directly on to you
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:29.120]   The customer castor's mattress is an obsessively engineered mattress and even more
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.800]   You know more awesome. It's at a fair price the original castor mattress
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.040]   Combines multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.840]   Uh with just the right sink just the right bounce plus its breathable design
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:45.120]   Helps you sleep cool and regulate your temperature through the night
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:51.600]   I've had other kinds of mattresses like this and they did not do that you'd wake up all sweaty and warm and it's just not that
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   You know enjoyable
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:00.080]   Castor mattress provides long lasting comfort and support you can buy it easily online and completely risk free
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.360]   They send you a big box
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:06.240]   They send you a big box, but you're still kind of amazed that there's a mattress inside the box until you open it up
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:12.080]   You slice open the the plastic and it's like it grows and it becomes a full-size mattress and
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:19.760]   Uh, then you yeah, it's just kind of amazing that they can ship it the way they do but they do and that's what makes it so easy to get online
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:26.560]   Uh, we've we've had a couple actually we have two castor mattresses in our home right now. We got our first one
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.800]   Uh quite quite a few years ago at this point. I think I think three years ago
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.600]   Uh super soft super comfortable
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.720]   I couldn't even imagine like replacing it with another kind of mattress like going into a show showroom floor and getting a
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.440]   Traditional one in fact my my older daughter still has like a traditional mattress and
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.240]   Uh, you know for like story time or whatever
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.000]   When i'm on that bed, it's just not nearly as comfortable like a we have to upgrade her at this point
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.120]   It's it's obviously we've gone too long without doing that so we will
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:01.040]   castor understands the importance of truly trying out a mattress and this is a big key here
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:06.000]   Uh, they know that in reality you're going to spend a third of your life on this mattress
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.560]   Uh, are on a mattress so castor offers free delivery and painless returns within a 100 day period

[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.720]   So I know somewhere down here
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.600]   There was a good iot story that I wanted to get your opinions on because I know you guys have opinions on this stuff
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:09.200]   You share them each and every week on your podcast
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:13.520]   Uh, so maybe you already talked about this, but uh, there's a new iot security bill
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.720]   That is expected to go into effect
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.160]   January 1st of 2020 here in california
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:28.080]   It was approved late last month and apparently it's the first of its kind the bill dictates that a manufacturer of a connected device
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:34.080]   It says quote shall equip the device with a reasonable security feature or features
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:41.200]   Which is so incredibly vague like i'm happy they did something, but i'm not really quite sure exactly what they did
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.760]   Uh, in that you don't want them to be too specific
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.880]   Because technology changes all the time
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:54.560]   So like that gives the ftc and this is how this is usually done is they're like make it reasonable and then like the agencies get to decide
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:58.560]   So the ftc will look at this and say well, what's reasonable today?
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.720]   Are you encrypting your traffic back and forth?
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:05.200]   Yeah, that's reasonable and then they're gonna make a fine against a company who doesn't and then the
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:11.280]   Company is going to litigate the fine and then the courts will decide if that is or isn't reasonable, right?
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.360]   So six years for now. We will actually know what this law will mean for companies
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:22.080]   This is just a starting point. It seems like but it but it is good
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:28.960]   Because it we we do need some kind of stick to hold up to companies and say hey
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:35.600]   You should follow this law. I mean, it's basically like telling your kid, you know, you're you're putting up the chore chart, right?
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.200]   Right, the kid can negotiate things and we'll forget sometimes
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:44.640]   but you'll give them a reasonable punishment or you know consequence and they'll
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:50.880]   Figure it out. I mean, that's that's kind of what this is. This is telling them. Hey, this is really important to me
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.840]   So could you take my feelings into consideration, please?
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.560]   And in kevin and I did we did talk about it. So kevin, do you want to talk about like
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:05.760]   This I mean the specifics about default passwords and stuff. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, that's um, that I think there were two things in there
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.920]   That are specific about not shipping devices with default passwords, which
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:18.640]   Meaning an individual password for each device that goes out the door to a consumer, which is kind of crazy talk. That's good
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:25.600]   Yeah, that's unusual devices right now share keys. So that's good. Mm-hmm. Right. And then I'm trying to think
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   Because there's only six hours ago. I should remember uh the updates you you have to force a user
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.760]   No, it was you have to force the user to change the password change the password, right?
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.640]   Yeah, so those are those are key
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:43.360]   So is that force force them to change their password or give them the option to change their password?
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:48.720]   At least no it it makes them change their password and most devices that
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:56.960]   So it doesn't stop them from putting password one two three as their new password, but that's my password. How did you know?
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:59.600]   I'm sorry kevin
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.040]   Teng it
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:07.120]   We're always spoiling kevin's password on this show and he keeps using one two three. I don't know why he does that
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:11.600]   Try four five six. Yeah, that'll throw
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:18.480]   Oh, we gotta have we gotta have a talk into you
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.840]   Uh, yeah, so baby steps. I guess this is this is uh a good
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:27.600]   Perhaps a good starting point a good example for other states, uh possibly federal
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.200]   Uh, you know something on more of a federal level that would that would be passed? I don't I don't know
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:38.880]   I don't know what this leads to but it's good. There is a federal law that was written and introduced last year
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:44.000]   Um, it did not it's just sitting there. Um, it was pretty lame though
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.840]   That law was like
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:49.360]   And everyone was like, oh, we're gonna get a cyber security law. It's gonna be amazing
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.120]   But basically it was like if you're gonna sell a connected device to the government
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.120]   It has to I think it was like be over there updateable, which is good
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   um, and then
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:04.720]   Oh, I can't remember all the specifics. It wasn't very powerful. It was pretty
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:10.160]   lame and it only applied to like a limited subset of devices that were sold to the government
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.880]   so
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.520]   again
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.160]   We don't have anything that's like I mean and and I see why it's hard
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:27.520]   And there are groups that are working with government agencies like the fda actually has been working with very respected
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.560]   hacking groups to come up with
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:34.080]   Rules basically for medical device security
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:39.520]   And that may be a smarter way to do it because the fda can actually create rules
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:46.880]   And update them and notify people at a much faster place or pace than congress can vote things into law
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.720]   so
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:54.560]   You know the the challenge though is these agencies spend a lot of time with the companies they regulate and there's
[00:59:55.040 --> 01:00:03.040]   You know, will they be strong enough? I don't know but they there are several legitimate efforts to create things like
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.600]   audit trails for devices so when something's hacked
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.320]   You know, you know what happened to it
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.920]   um updates so making sure everything's over there updateable
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.600]   um
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:21.840]   And rules around that there's rules around encryption. So so those are happening. They're just not happening through like legislation
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.520]   Yeah, those are so important
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.560]   Uh as we continue to see time and time again
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.280]   Many examples why it's so important
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.720]   Unfortunately, unfortunately has to do with our data. So
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:40.560]   Uh, we'll we'll learn our lesson at some point. Um, I thought this was good really good news on
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.840]   Monday qualcom had an event to show off something that has been
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:50.560]   A couple of years in the making the new snapdragon wear 3100
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.640]   processor
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.440]   The the previous one the 20 I think it was the 2100 or the 2200 has been used
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.480]   More than two years now and you know people have long complained about like android
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:11.360]   Uh, where o s devices being slow and kind of not super responsive and just kind of lagging in development
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.480]   Especially when you compare it to the watches that are doing very well. So i'm saying has its um
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:22.720]   G, I think it's the gear s three line that people seem to really like obviously, you know, there's the the stripped down fit bit
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.280]   Um style watches that aren't like full
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:31.680]   encompassing smart watches or whatever but do a lot of similar stuff and then obviously apple
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:38.880]   Which has a new series of apple watches that they announced today at an event which will not be named at least that was my plan
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.960]   And I just did i'm very sorry about that
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:46.400]   Uh anyways snapdragon wear 3100 was announced and I think this is a
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.520]   This is a very big deal for wear o s devices
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.240]   I'm curious to know what you guys think as far as these wearables are concerned
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.760]   Um, is it is it a little late to the game to fix?
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:06.400]   Android wear devices at this point like has has the ship sailed to a certain degree or do you think there's still a lot of life left in this category
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.800]   We talked about this on this show
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.080]   Not quite in that but I my thought was
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.760]   I mean kevin was kind of like man the first place but my thought was after watching what apple did today
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.720]   And I know this is not an apple focus show but I was like
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.440]   dang qualcom
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.080]   You look so lame
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.520]   And I feel bad. I mean I love qualcom but
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.040]   But man
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.840]   So okay, i'm i'm really curious to hear what you what you have to say about this because like like
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.480]   explaining that that thinking because
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.320]   Basically the research that I did around the snapdragon wear 3100
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.840]   Was initially was for last night's show all about android and we talked about it then and it was like okay great
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:58.320]   Today I have been so completely blissfully unaware of anything apple. I know that there was an apple watch
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:04.640]   I know no details. So what did you see in the kind of new new kind of development of apple watch
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:09.760]   That makes you then look at what the the where 3100 offers and go me
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.280]   They kind of I mean they cram like a 64 bit
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:21.360]   Processor a low. I mean it still probably sucks batteries way faster than an android wear watch. I don't have one. So I don't know
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.720]   um
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.720]   And then they also developed a
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.960]   Because apple controls that silicon
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:33.760]   You know itself and can say hey designers. We're looking at doing this. Can you optimize the heck out of this for these?
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.000]   You know six use cases
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.160]   They fall detection and the I guess advanced
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:47.120]   the next gen accelerometer and gyroscope that is better at detecting various gestures
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.320]   I don't know how much of that is like apple marketing glaze
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.120]   But the end result and the features that they have with some of that was
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:04.320]   Really astonishing like the ability to like accurately detect a fall in you know star various processes for that is something that
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:12.000]   And the fact that this is FDA approved for a variety of the FDA approvals mostly on the afib. I don't think it's on fall detection
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.880]   but
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:19.040]   Jeebus that's it's awesome and super compelling
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:28.880]   It's something it's something that I think google could do with where os but hasn't in my opinion
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.680]   Um, I mean ultimately we're talking about
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.960]   Yeah, okay. Maybe apple has got some secret sauce in their chips and no i'm not trying to discount what they do
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.400]   They do a great job in their chip design, but the fact that they
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:44.400]   You know, they're using very similar if not the same sensors
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:50.640]   It's all in that integration that they can do because they control the hardware the software and so on
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.880]   I
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.120]   It's in the presentation. I guess it's the way and the implementation is probably the best way to say it
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.920]   And that's not something i've seen from android where now where os and that's why i don't
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.080]   Have one of those watches. I actually do own an apple watch. It's the apple watch three with lte
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:13.040]   It's because it just works better for what I needed to do, you know, and the four looked impressive i'm not upgrading but
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.680]   Um, they looked impressive now you are an android phone
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:26.800]   User though, right you showed it off earlier. How how do you pull that off with the apple watch because it's not necessarily a super interoperable?
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:34.960]   Device right? No, it's not really very interoperable interoperable at all. That's why kevin has two sim cards
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:41.920]   Okay, all right, and so i'm important enough to put a sim card in it. Yeah, well, let's put it this way. I've done that
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.080]   My entire
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:51.680]   Writing career. I've always had multiple sim cards at one point I had sim cards from all four carriers for review phones and my own phones
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:58.400]   So that's not unusual for me. I didn't do that just to get the apple watch but for a wearable that works best for me
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.200]   So I just leave the iPhone on the wireless charger at the house and when I leave the house
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:09.920]   I get my calls anyway on my wrist and i'm fine or have my other phone with the android sim in it. So, right
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.080]   I know i'm weird. I know
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.080]   I mean, the big
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:21.200]   The big Qualcomm wear news there was like the double the door radius. I mean, I don't know
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:27.200]   Do you want to do you want an android wear watch? I mean, I I don't have an iPhone
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:31.840]   So i'm not going to buy an apple watch. I use a fit bit, but yeah, I just look at this and i'm like
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.240]   And
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.280]   It's not it's not the chip that has held things back. I know people were on that bandwagon
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.560]   Yeah, ronamato whom I totally respected a whole thing where he's i was like, oh
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:52.000]   But it's not it's not really a chip because what is this chip and we talked about earlier on our other show. I mean, it's um
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:00.160]   I forget it's it's reworked architecture of an of a different chip. It's a customized version of that of that chip stacey. What was that the um
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.480]   Darn, I forget now
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:09.040]   Okay, hold on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well, there's a rework of the 2100 though the one beforehand or no something completely different
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:15.520]   It's not completely different. Basically what they've done is they've added a low powered co-processor
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:23.600]   So that we can so they can offload what they say is 95 of what people typically do with their watches most of the time
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.600]   Which is very very light in terms of processing power needed
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   So if you can offload those to the lower powered chips just like we do with our phones today
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.640]   When you need processing power that other high powered one is there and therefore you save battery life
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:44.000]   That's kind of it to me and that's like that's not solving where os is problem. The problem is the interface. It's apps
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.440]   It's it's a couple of things great about it is is what's that? It's boring
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.960]   Okay
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:59.440]   Yeah, it has been now google is has been showing off the new where os
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.120]   Revisions like so they're going through and they're doing yet another
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.960]   Where os upgrades so they're they've given it a facelift
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.360]   And I think we're starting to see that on the new phones
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:14.720]   Especially the phones that come out with this new processor of which I think we know of one right now the month blanc
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:20.480]   Summit two, which is not it not going to be an inexpensive wearable device
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.320]   the
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.360]   The first one was an eight hundred ninety dollars to start
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:30.480]   Watch, you know and going up but anyways, they've they've retooled
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.320]   Wear os to from from a usability standpoint and
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.560]   Ui and all that they've upgraded it to kind of the current
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:43.920]   Kind of philosophy design philosophy that google's been touting with uh with material
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.760]   theming and
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.080]   And all that so it definitely looks different. I don't know if it looks different enough though
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.440]   I haven't been able to play around with it
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.480]   I like what i've seen in the screenshots, but I would definitely agree stacy the previous wear os
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:02.400]   And android wear before it it was pretty boring like I I appreciated what google was doing which was saying
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:07.280]   Let's not let manufacturers like skin it all to craziness and and you know
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.760]   Go down the rabbit hole that we went years ago with with android os being skin to
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.440]   You know to tears and then it's not updateable and all these kind of other problems
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.560]   Let's let's solidify it into a singular kind of design
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:23.120]   Uh, but it just wasn't that exciting it was maybe utilitarian but not exciting
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:30.720]   And on the utilitarian side they talk about this being you can swap it out of like smartwatch mode into like normal watch mode
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.720]   I don't even know what we would call that
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.440]   And it'll last for like a week on without rega like without
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.200]   Having to recharge it so traditional watch mode is what they call it
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.960]   Right
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.800]   So like that that kind of falls into what you're talking about which is
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.960]   Look, some people
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.280]   They just want to watch with the slightly extra features. I don't know who those people are
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.280]   I mean like I feel like you
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.000]   If you want to smartwatch you're looking at like the apple
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.880]   Right and if you want like a fitness tracker then you might do the apple or you might do fit bit
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.240]   If you're not in the apple ecosystem, so it's not clear
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:12.160]   The the android wears for people who only want to smartwatch on sometimes or days
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.040]   I
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.160]   Mean I think android wear is just for those people who are on android who feel like yeah
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.000]   They need the smart watch capabilities, but they can't do an apple watch apple doesn't
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:27.920]   Have that interoperability and not everybody is going to be willing to get an extra sim and put it in their apple watch
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.000]   Even though they have an android phone
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.280]   Uh, you know, I'm sure there are other people that do that like you do Kevin, but I don't know if there's a
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.120]   I don't like it but it's still
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.520]   You still need a iphone to talk it like
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.440]   Yes, so you need a spare iphone laying
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.160]   Right, right. Yeah, I mean it's not it's not inexpensive because you have to have an iphone
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.840]   You have to have service for the iphone
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.800]   And you're gonna pay another $10 a month if you add lte to the watch because of the e-sim in there
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.040]   So right yes, you're paying for convenience, but you know, edivolot
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.040]   I don't disagree with anything you guys said about the
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.240]   Blowness of where os and what it has not accomplished
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:11.440]   I've actually owned three four maybe even five android wear watches the issue for me and maybe again. I'm an oddball
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:16.320]   I I run every day. I exercise. I use the watch to track everything
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.120]   and no watch yet
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.560]   Except for maybe the motor rule of moto active from 2012
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.000]   Is is rock solid for that then the apple watch for me?
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.120]   I get app crashes all kinds of problems on
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:35.200]   On the android wear apps the same apps that use in the apple watch that work fine. I just don't understand it
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.760]   Yeah, that's a big bummer. Yeah
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.880]   I agree. I should I should point out you don't just run every day
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.520]   you've run daily since
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.000]   June 10th 2016. How do you know the date? Do you have a tattoo or something?
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.520]   No, I'm not a tattooed on my wrist. No, it's under it's on your twitter profile
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:01.440]   Oh, yes. Okay. You're correct. That was that was the day my son graduated high school
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.760]   I've run since he graduated high school and he just turned 21 yesterday
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:11.520]   So it's kind of weird that I've still kept that running streak going. Yeah, that's that's a big accomplishment
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.520]   My goodness every single day. No, it's weird
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.520]   It's the fact that I've been with kevin like
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.000]   Like at conferences and things like that and i'm like, you know, it's 11 o'clock
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.400]   We're coming back from a bar or something, you know, not not trash or anything
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.680]   But we've had like a drink or two and kevin's like, all right guys. I gotta go to my run-in and we're all like
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:32.640]   I gotta go to bed
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.440]   Gotta get it in before midnight, you know, the clock's taking
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:41.600]   Did I freak you out for a second? You thought I just had that like jigglein around in my brain
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.720]   I had no idea where you got that
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.440]   I forgot it was on my profile. I saw it on your profile earlier today
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.320]   That's the only reason that I remember it. I was like, wow, he's a he's a like a runner very dedicated runner
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.520]   So when you brought it up, I had to you got me back for the beginning of the show then
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:06.160]   Yeah, my brain does not work like that believe me. I try and memorize things like that and it just doesn't work
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:12.640]   Um, what else are we missing here? What are some fun things because there's there's some other kind of landmines in here
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:18.320]   That maybe we we don't need to talk about but uh, is there anything in here that you guys wanted to touch on before I get into the
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.760]   Change log not not quite yet though kerson
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:32.160]   Um, let's see. I was looking at the dongle for the stupid headphones because this is my my hilai will die on all right
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:38.000]   I have the phone. I got the dongle. Yeah, the dongle didn't work
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.560]   So I had to call google because it failed and they sent me another dongle dongle also failed
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.640]   So I had to buy my own dongle
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.360]   Which also failed so the fact that they're
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.720]   Now offering a more expensive dongle
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.080]   Yeah, I just hate this so that is all i'm just like this is
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.800]   Just just please
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.200]   If you can't do something like awesome air pods because the air pods are very nice
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.880]   Very nice. Don't don't take away the headphone jack, man
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.360]   I mean come on
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.720]   I I wish I had known that you had dongle challenges because I still have one from my
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:17.600]   Essential phone that i'm not using because I am
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.760]   Because none of mine do
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.160]   Yeah, as far as I know it works
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.280]   but I
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.840]   I so went the air pods route and I use it with Andrew phones and my
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.800]   Watch and I run them with them every day and they're pretty good. I hate to say it
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:41.200]   I can't do the I went in I bought the jobra 65t headphones for like 170
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.280]   Yes, and those things are
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.120]   Awesome. Yeah, very solid
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.760]   they do kind of
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:51.680]   They're a little big in my ears like if I wear them for more than like two or three hours
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.800]   my
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.840]   My little
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.040]   Whatever that curve in your earbone is it it hurts
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.680]   Um, but that's about it
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:00.720]   Wait, wait a second
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.360]   So you spent 170 on wireless headphones and you were talking about a $12 dongle
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.840]   Well, I was trying to only spend $12 actually
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.680]   I have
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.960]   40 pairs of normal headphones that I would just like to use
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:20.800]   So a $9 dongle made a lot of sense up until it became like a $36 dongle
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:25.600]   I got vinyl albums too, but I mean, you know, I'm still streaming music
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.520]   All right
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.400]   Special occasion you pull out the vinyl but yes
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.280]   Your daily convenience listen is streaming
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:39.520]   Um, I mean, I would I have resisted anyone who watches or listens to all about android
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:46.800]   Uh for any length of time will know that I have very vehemently resisted switching to bluetooth for audio for a number of years
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.080]   Up until recently when I challenged myself and I said, all right
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:56.400]   I'm going to review a bunch of bluetooth headphones and do a shoot out on screen savers because that's the only way i'm going to get over this
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:01.840]   This thing that I have with bluetooth and I want to find a pair that really works and yeah, the jobbers were
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:07.520]   Pretty much top of the heap and I use them every day now now like dongle isn't even part of my vocabulary
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.960]   Dongle is if I happen to accidentally forget to charge up the case that the jobbers go into
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.920]   Which doesn't happen because it lasts for days and days and days and at least once over that period of time
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.480]   I plug it in for a couple of hours. So
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.080]   um
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.080]   Yeah, I don't know. I think I got over it
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.080]   Well
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.120]   I had just bought headphones like noise canceling headphones for the airplane, you know that
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.680]   required a
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.080]   A jack and like I was dang it
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:42.000]   No, I gotta spend because like I feel like I have a separate set of headphones for my airplane trips with noise cancellation
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.800]   And the jobbers the jobbers are pretty good for it. So
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:51.280]   Yeah, they're good at isolating. They're good isolating headphones, but I do resent having to buy
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   I mean, I've spent what I feel is like
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:01.600]   What 200 dollars on headphone gear that I feel very resentful about because I shouldn't have had to spend it because I had
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:08.400]   Perfectly acceptable ones. Yeah, so that's it. Yeah, that's fair. I'm done. I'm done complaining about dongles
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:12.160]   Well, and there's still kind of a question mark out there, right?
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:17.200]   Because there are some companies like it really seemed like the trend the wave was going to be
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:24.400]   All-in on you know removing the headphone jack and sending this audio through the USB-C port
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.040]   But not everybody jumped jumped ships, so we're still kind of in this
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:38.160]   Confusing area of well, some of them, you know have the the old standard, but some of them are very you know dead set on this dongle
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.360]   Vision of the future and uh, it's kind of hard to know
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.800]   It's definitely something you still have to check for when you're buying a new phone
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:49.440]   Well, and if I found a phone with the features and as part of the google is it
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:57.200]   Whatever that updates automatically instead of waiting for my carrier to do it. Yeah, I would probably choose the headphone one over
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:03.200]   One without I mean like it that's still actually a really even though I do have bluetooth headphones now
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.200]   I still have my old ones. So
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.920]   It this is I mean like I know people complain about the notch the dongle is my notch
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.320]   There now we're putting it in terms people can understand there you go
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:24.400]   All right, what do you say karsen let's jump into the google change log?
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.400]   Oh, he wasn't ready for that
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:34.240]   All right, i'll stretch out my uh my throw next time
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:41.360]   Uh, this is where we check in on a few things real quick to see what google's been up to because they make a lot of announcements that
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.920]   Log that that we went to earlier is home for a lot of these announcements
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:52.320]   Uh, but we'll just run through these real quick google home is apparently getting some new games if you're a fan of disney
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.720]   And you know, I would imagine families. This is going to come in really handy. You just say hey g
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:02.720]   Play and then there's a bunch of new disney games. Um, mowie's music game toy story freeze dance
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:09.600]   My kids have played the freeze dance game. They love it. Oh, uh, it's pretty awesome. Disney princess apparently
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:13.200]   I'm not really quite sure what that's uh about but i'm sure my kids would love that too
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.480]   Uh, I think overall the big challenge here is actually remembering that those games exist
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.760]   Like remembering the right thing to say and everything because that's that's my big challenge with google home
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:29.280]   It's capable of so many things, but I can never remember how to get the thing that I want because there's so many of them
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.560]   We're playing freeze dance tonight. Mm. Oh
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.560]   Yeah
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.480]   Uh, good make sure and uh put it up on youtube because everyone will want to see that
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.120]   That's not happening
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:47.680]   Google assistant language support is widening now they've added support for both danish and norwegian languages
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.880]   Uh, and google is of course working to
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:56.560]   Um, it made a promise to bring google home to some of these regions by the end of 2018
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:04.160]   This language support obviously is a very critical step in making that happen. So one step closer to widening
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.360]   The market for uh google home and google assistant
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.800]   I'm holding up for latin. Yeah, that's still not
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:16.000]   Not yet. Nope. No latin yet. I mean actually when you look at the the language support
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.480]   It's a pretty small list. So i'm not surprised
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:25.680]   Google news, I which I would argue is one of my favorite of of the latest kind of wave of google apps
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.240]   I use it
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.280]   I use it more than I want to use it because it's such a good app
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.760]   I've actually set it up with digital well-being to use it only an hour a day because
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:39.680]   If I don't have that on there like i'll continue to read the news and sometimes that doesn't make me feel good to read the news
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.120]   But it's such a great app. They did such a good job with it. Anyways
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:49.840]   Uh for new core features are set to arrive in the next couple of weeks. It's all about saving data. So if you're using google news
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:56.240]   You don't want to save your data on the go. That's kind of what these features are. There's a youtube go functionality
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:01.120]   Um that it'll use by default. So that'll kind of have lighter connection requirements
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:05.760]   News cast which is the story previews function is going to be more text focused
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:10.080]   Uh when you're on mobile so it saves on data doesn't load all those heavy images
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:17.920]   Speaking of images and video images are going to be compressed by default videos and gifs won't autoplay when you're on mobile
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.280]   So but if you want them to you can tap on them and they'll load
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:28.080]   Uh upon a tap and then you can save articles to read later and those would download uh when you're on wi-fi which
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.240]   I'm kind of surprised that wasn't there. I guess I assumed it was there but I just wasn't using it but apparently it wasn't there
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.960]   The the read it later functionality
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:45.200]   So that's good and then finally this was just kind of neat. Um, I don't know how many times you guys have played the chrome dino
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:51.440]   Jumping game when you know, oh my god every kid of my kid my child's class plays that game and loves it
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:56.800]   Heck yeah because it's right there. You know, it's I think you can turn it off. I think there's some way to disable it
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:02.640]   But no one ever does no why would you it's fun? Well, I know but but that's dino
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:08.320]   It's pretty awesome. There's a there's an interview with uh, I think the guy that that created the the
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.000]   The dino or the dino game uh four years ago
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.800]   And I just thought a couple of facts were interesting 270 million games are played every month
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:22.720]   Most of those happen to happen in uh markets with go figure unreliable internet
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.680]   So, you know, it appears when you don't have that connectivity and then the game is programmed
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.040]   I don't know if this was a joke or not
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:34.320]   But I'm set to believe him when he said that the game is programmed to max out at 17 million years
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.440]   Which is the amount of time the t-rex was alive on earth
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:44.000]   Wow, so when you say max out, what does that if you were to play for 17 million years you would reach the end
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.040]   okay, so
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.800]   Somebody gets started
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:52.400]   Can we get 17 million or 17 million people each playing for a year?
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.240]   So it would be like 17 million man years
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:58.480]   I don't think it works like that though. We wouldn't reach the end and if you do reach the end
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.880]   Do you get like a message like you made it?
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.880]   What's the future like?
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.880]   That's the end of the day
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.040]   Yes
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.040]   The dinosaur walks into a grave and
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.200]   All right, that was the google change log
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.120]   All right
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:25.920]   Let's take a moment to thank the sponsor and then we'll get back and do some tips and tricks and I guess we won't have a number today because Jeff still
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:30.320]   Is still a way enjoying his time in Austin and not fighting the internet
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.920]   This episode of this week in google is brought to you by last pass
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:40.720]   What is your company doing to ensure passwords are being shared responsible responsibly appropriately?
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:47.520]   I know we're using we're using last pass. I've been using last pass for years personally last pass enterprise makes password share
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.440]   Convenient for employees while keeping access to corporate data
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:58.560]   Secure it even allows for full customization of access including the ability to set a master password requirement
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:03.680]   Enable password resets restrict access when that happens to be needed
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:09.600]   You can configure over 100 policies access security reports and you can create
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:14.800]   Shared folders so everyone's on the same page with the same passwords across the enterprise
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.840]   Organized database logins ssh keys
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:22.080]   software licenses and business information and
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.520]   I actually just set this up today on my business account
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:30.880]   I've had it on my personal account for a while you can further protect your business with multi-factor authentication
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:37.600]   The last pass authenticator app a verification button pops up on an employee's phone to guarantee
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:43.360]   They are the only ones with access to their accounts actually very easy if credentials are compromised
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.720]   The app ensures outsiders will not have access
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:53.680]   Super important stuff especially when you consider all your passwords are there you might as well protect it as much as you can multi-factor is awesome for that
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:59.920]   The last pass password generator again. I use this daily because if it gets so easy
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.160]   It's super easy to to use to create unique random passwords
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:11.200]   So that you know employees don't have to remember or write one down if they have to like write their own chances are they're probably going to choose one
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.000]   That they've already written before because it's easy to remember or that is just out of habit
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.760]   And in this case employees can log into last pass with their Microsoft active directory credentials
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.200]   So they truly only have one password to remember and
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:32.880]   In doing so that password generator you can set it to be super secure with all sorts of extra characters and all that stuff
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:36.000]   Data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.800]   It's also stored in the vault and kept secret even from last pass
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:48.960]   Uh, there's easy onboarding to password auto fill last pass makes it easy for businesses to take control passwords and reduce the threat of breach
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.840]   And the iOS 12 and android
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:59.600]   Oreo auto fill functionality makes it easier for employees to seamlessly use last pass across multiple
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:05.680]   Mobile devices. I use it on many devices and it's awesome to have that auto fill functionality just kick in when you need it
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:12.640]   When you open an app or you visit a mobile site the keyboard itself will offer your username or password as an auto fill option
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.440]   Similar to what auto correct looks like now
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:20.960]   So that way you don't have to copy and paste from your last pass app. It just kind of brings it in naturally
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:28.000]   Last pass also offers last pass premium for personal use last pass families for your entire family and last pass teams
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.720]   For teams of 50 or fewer and it's awesome. I actually just moved us
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:38.640]   Uh our family over to last pass family. So we're using that now and uh, it's it's awesome. It's a game changer
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:44.480]   More than 13 million people trust last pass the number one most preferred password manager
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:51.680]   You learn more by going to last pass dot com slash twit today check it out and make sure that your password
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.760]   Uh, your passwords are more secure. That's last pass dot com
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:02.080]   Slash twit and see which product is right for you and we thank last pass for their support of this week in google
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:06.720]   All right, let's see here down to the bottom of the dock
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:12.160]   And we'll start with you kevin you have a tip and we we had a little tease forward to the tip
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:18.480]   So tell us all about it. We do have a tip. Um and and actually jeff does have a number how many times did he call into this show
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.560]   That's a good question. I don't know i'm guessing like five six
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:29.600]   There's your number. There we go. All right, that works. So so I may be a little over zealous when it comes to security
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:36.800]   However, I I did splurge and spend the $50 on the titan security key bundle which recently arrived
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:42.080]   Um, that's the box. It's actually a little magnetic box just like the pixel book box
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:47.360]   Which is kind of a nice touch, but you don't buy it for the box you buy it for the uh the usb
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:52.160]   And the bluetooth and nfc both of these are nfc actually
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.280]   Um, so one is usb one is bluetooth
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:01.440]   And you can set these up for two factor authentication just like you can with a ubk or any other comparable key
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.520]   um
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:09.200]   A lot of people don't realize even though two factor authentication is really to prevent fishing for your online passwords
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:15.120]   If you think about it a chrome book is being signed in with your online password being your google password
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:22.320]   So what I started doing about six months ago and again not this is not for everybody. I set up two factor authentication using the
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.160]   google support page, uh, which is easily defined
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.000]   um
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.200]   and
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.320]   There's a way to say do not trust this computer
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:39.600]   Uh, or do not remember don't ask again on this computer by not checking that every time I log into my chrome book
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.840]   I do have to insert my
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:45.520]   usb key or use the new titan with with bluetooth
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.920]   But what that does is that that actually
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:53.200]   Eliminates the possibility of anybody ever logging into your chrome book. I even have it set up
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.040]   There's options in chrome to not show your email address
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.880]   Which typically it would when you boot up and also to completely disable guess mode
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.040]   I've done all that so literally if you were to open up my chrome book you don't even know my
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.560]   Email address so all those things together really maximize the security of a chrome book
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.760]   Because when somebody gets in there then they can go to password stack google.com if you don't have two factors set up
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:21.680]   Get all your passwords. It's right there. So I I would say consider it if you're going to buy one of these keys
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:28.880]   Actually use it keep it separate from your chrome book, but don't uh allow it to remember your chrome book use it every time
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:39.120]   Good tip one thing I should point out on on using that with the pixel book is that the pixel book has a usb seaport
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.600]   And those keys are not usb c right so you're going to need a dongle
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:46.480]   Here we are again dongle world
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:51.920]   So a lot of people are unhappy about this you are absolutely correct and included in the box
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:55.520]   You do get a type a to type c adapter
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:59.840]   Um, I actually understand why google did this
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:05.360]   Because we're in a transition right now and yes all the newer chrome books have usb c
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.200]   But think of the probably tens of millions that do not
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.840]   Yeah, that's true the quickest way to secure the entire quote unquote fleet of chrome books out there
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:19.360]   Is to do it this way usb a with an adapter. So I think it was a smart move on their part
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.400]   I understand the gripes, but it was a smart move. I just saw a picture last week of
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:31.120]   You know just an awesome pixel book and then the stacked dongles coming out of the port and they're just like oh
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:36.400]   I just it doesn't look nearly as polished as it will someday it will someday at some point
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:40.640]   No, it won't because they'll keep changing interfaces. I hate everybody
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:46.320]   Fine
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:49.760]   What's uh, what you got on in store for us stacy?
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:55.760]   Speaking of things that change all the time and are unreliable. I have a smart home device for you
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:02.640]   Um, this is the brilliant controller. Um, I had hoped to have a review finished for you guys
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.080]   So I could just point to that it look for tomorrow at stacey on iot
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.640]   Uh, but
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:13.440]   Here's I've I've got it installed downstairs, but I have one here in front of me
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:16.000]   So you guys can see it. This is actually just the faceplate
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.120]   Um for the device these grooves here. Nope these grooves here
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:27.280]   Our capacitive touch this is to fit on the two gang light switch. So that means there's two switches in it
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:31.920]   Um, and this is going to turn whatever light is on and off from there
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:36.800]   You can actually program these for other lights should you not care about the light that is
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.960]   in the switch
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:46.560]   Um, this here integrates it's a five inch touch screen that offers you control for a lot of smart devices
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:49.280]   Such as the ring doorbell the eco B thermostat
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:52.000]   Um, since this is twig
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.520]   They will have a nest integration, but they don't have it just yet
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.520]   Sonos wemo
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.400]   Smart things hub all of these
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:07.760]   And it also has a microphone and a speaker in it so you can use it as a way to talk to madam a
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:11.680]   I
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.920]   Think it's doing a little too much. This is the this one in my hand is
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:22.480]   Three 49, um, the one gang switch which is basically just a touch screen
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:24.480]   Is
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:26.480]   $300 or $2.99
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:31.920]   It's a lot for I think anyone the user interface needs a little bit of work
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:35.840]   But it does have a very clear picture
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.480]   So if you're like really wanting a beautiful light switch, it also doubles as an inner comb
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:44.400]   So if you have multiples of these in your house, you could be like
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.160]   Hey
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.840]   Brilliant wake up the kids
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.240]   They show this in a video and then the the other brilliance at other rooms because they've set up a scene
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:56.640]   They turn on the lights in the kids room and it starts to glow and it's very compelling and cool
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.880]   Getting from
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:04.800]   Unboxing to that particular video coolness is going to be very counterintuitive and take a lot of work
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.840]   But you could do it and it would be fun. Um
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:11.760]   So that's that's kind of the thought I think in about six months
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:16.640]   I would re take another look at this and be like oh, I totally could have this now
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.760]   But right now it's probably for like the diehard smart home people
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:25.280]   It's called the brilliant switch. So is the idea that you'd have one of these in every room basically
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.080]   you know
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:32.240]   You don't need it in every room. That's actually what's kind of cool like when I installed it
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.920]   It actually detected the wemo light switch. I still have in my master bedroom
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.560]   Um, and it was like if I hit
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:45.360]   The lighting button on this thing when I was walking up to the light that's installed down downstairs at my stairs
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.840]   It would actually show me like a little
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:53.040]   dimmer switch for my master bedroom and my stair light because it knew what was there so you could actually
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:58.320]   Use one or two of them and control all the lights in your house
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:04.160]   I don't think that's really an awesome way to go about it because you still probably want to control the lights in your room, but
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.640]   It's kind of neat. Yeah, I mean you'd probably want
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:15.280]   One for places like in your kitchen area, maybe in your kids bedrooms
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.920]   I don't love that it has a camera in it. I know
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.800]   I mean it has a privacy shutter you can stick down
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:26.160]   But so you could still shout at your kids, but I still shout at my kids through an echo dot and that's 50 bucks
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.560]   so
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.520]   Yeah
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.600]   How do you know they're not muting the echo dot?
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:37.280]   They sometimes they do you're like drop in on you know drop in on nana and then I hear
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.840]   Alexa hang up
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:45.200]   Smart
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.760]   That's great. These are not inexpensive either
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.080]   299 for the one switch panel for 49 for the four switch panel
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:55.040]   Yeah, so that's
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:02.400]   Again, if you love this sort of stuff. Yeah, go to town. It's fun, but if you're a normal person I would wait on this. Yeah
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:06.000]   Cool, that is the brilliant switch
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:13.280]   Um, I thought I would show how easy it is now to get multi lingual support in google assistant
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.760]   Which is something that they've been working on they just released this not too long ago this functionality
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:22.560]   Uh, and it's actually pretty easy to get to although it is a couple of steps
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:28.240]   But they've said the supported languages now english german french spanish Italian and japanese
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:34.560]   Sure more to be added over time, but if you want to have multi lingual supports you so you know
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:40.880]   It's maybe it's a multi lingual household and each of you wants to talk in a different language to your google home
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.680]   Or your assistant that's kind of what this is all about
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:48.240]   So I can show it off real quick show you where to look to do that on my phone
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:55.120]   An assistant or pull up assistant go to that little navigation like the compass looking thing
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:58.160]   Which is the explore button overflow button
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.000]   settings
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.760]   Take me to preferences and then assistant languages
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.640]   So it's a few steps to get there once you go in there you'll now see that there is an add a language
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:15.840]   uh bar here and when I tap that all the different languages that I can go ahead and throw in there i'll do a spaniel
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:19.440]   Mexico and there we go and now it if I spoke
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:27.920]   Spanish which I do not yeah, there we go. Uh, I could instruct. Let's see here. What did I look at in sean de las lucas. Let's see here
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.720]   Oh, we did this didn't we kevin in sean de las lucas yes
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:38.560]   Lucas oh well, it's still got it. No, it didn't lucas and sean de las lucas
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:47.920]   Oh, hey all the lights went out of my home, but I don't know why I didn't respond in Spanish. That's what it's supposed to do, right?
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.080]   That's what it should do
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:55.760]   Ask it a question in Spanish. Yeah. Well, I just did. Oh a question in spanish. Yeah
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:58.960]   And this dollar's up at teria
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:01.760]   Okay, no, no
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.800]   Well, it gave me the pulp fiction scene which is yeah
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.440]   That's kind of where that came from to be honest. Uh, yeah
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:15.520]   Maybe I'm not the right person to show off this feature. No, okay, so hold on
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:25.040]   Como se di say smartphone on español. Okay, it's smartphone and go must say di say smartphone and español
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:35.840]   Oh google talk to me in Spanish. Why don't you well it should work? I don't know why it doesn't but I can I have a fluent
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:38.560]   Spiess fluent Spanish speaker we can come up with something
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.760]   I'm just not I'm not sure why it's not giving me my answers in the in the language that I spoke
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:46.400]   I definitely set it up in the settings. So that's strange
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.720]   Um
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:52.160]   Yeah, maybe I'm not the right person to show it off. I mean it's there right
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.480]   This is these are the languages for speaking to your assistant doesn't necessarily say that it's gonna reply in those languages
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.720]   Maybe that's it. I don't know
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.920]   Maybe maybe it's isolated to the fact that my phone itself doesn't have that extra language loaded
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.280]   Maybe maybe that's it. You know what I mean. Oh, hold on. Let me see
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.520]   Okay holding on
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:18.320]   Wow, that was off mic
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:24.560]   I don't know. I think she's testing with her google home. Okay. I think
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.720]   chaos less clemis
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:34.400]   Nothing my my daughter is trying to my accent is terrible
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:41.440]   So Anna come here
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:46.240]   All right here here we go her debut. Yes exactly
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.280]   Whether whether she wants to be on
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:52.560]   On video or not
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:58.480]   Chaos el klima there we go. Yeah, the weather. I don't know. It's it's not gonna
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.560]   That was what is the weather and so it should answer you in Spanish. Yes el klima
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.280]   Okay
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.280]   Chaos el klima
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:11.600]   Oh
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:15.120]   Go go away
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:20.160]   Get out of here google assistant work on your your language support a little bit more
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:24.640]   I mean, I told you how to turn it on. I just didn't tell you how to make it actually work
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:27.920]   That's out of my hands. That's all on google
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.120]   You'll have better luck
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:37.040]   Uh, maybe you guys will have better luck. Yeah, let us know how it goes for you, but
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.480]   Uh, we've reached the end of this week in google and I really appreciate once again having the opportunity to jump on with you guys
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.760]   And uh kevin it's great to see you again. Thanks for hopping on today's show really appreciate it
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:55.200]   My pleasure great to be here. Absolutely. So uh, tell people where you want them to go to to follow all the cool stuff you're doing right now
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:40:00.800]   Well, if you want to learn about chrome books, uh, let's see it's about chrome books.com
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.560]   So that's pretty easy to remember
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:08.240]   Makes sense. Um, and then I work with stacey on our iot podcast and iot podcast.com
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:11.840]   And i'll let her plug the other site because I don't want to hag up all the time so
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:15.600]   Thanks again kevin toffle you're awesome. I really appreciate it
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:20.720]   And stacey always a pleasure to get the chance to podcast with you and you are off next week, right?
