[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.200]   And always with the great Jeff Jarvis from...
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   [Laughs]
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   How far have you gotten?
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200]   [Laughs]
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   At Buzzmachine.com, he is...
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   I just got it.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   Professor of Journalism. I've been listening to it because...
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   You have? How is it?
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   It's like reading the National Enquirer. It's...
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   [Laughs]
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   I'm talking about Fire and Fury, Michael Wolf's...
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   ...scathing.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   Well, it's interesting. I don't know if it's... I don't know how to describe it.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   His behind the scenes at the White House...
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   ...tell all.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   ...Brashfire?
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   That's probably a good way to describe it.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.200]   But hey, that's Matthew Ingram. He is a journalist.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   You know how I know he works at the Columbia Journalism Review, but he's also been, as you know, a giga-home unfortunate.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   It's great to have you on the show from Canada.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   Like...
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   Yes.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   You can... you're just watching from the sidelines.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   So do you have Howard Stern in Canada?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   We do.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   Oh, you do?
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   Nice.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   They have serious.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   Maybe you...
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   Oh, because it's serious.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   Yeah, because it's a regular... is a regular request.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   Yeah, I feel like I kind of... I know Howard by proxy.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   So you were on Stern yesterday?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   I called in because he was saying, "No, Oprah, no. Don't run, no, Oprah."
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   Well, I want to say that too. Haven't we had enough of celebrity presence?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.200]   That's exactly what I... that's exactly what I called in.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   And it was interesting because he said when he ran for governor, he said he earnestly got scared that people were voting for him.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   And he said, "It's a joke."
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   Yeah, well, I don't... again, I don't know whether it's true or not, but that's one of the best scenes in "Fire and Fury."
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   Apparently, on November 7th, everybody in the Trump campaign was preparing their resumes, getting ready for a fine post-election relaxation, getting those...
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   No one expected to win.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   No one thought they would win. And then he describes, like, Melania bursting in tears when...
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   Yes.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   ...and when he... when they won.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   And not tears were going.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   And Trump... and Trump...
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   ...and Trump saying, at first, I can't believe it.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   And then saying, "Well, good, because I'm going to be the best president ever."
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   And it's just...
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   But it's not that moment.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   Until that point, it sounded like he was perfectly happy to lose.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   He didn't want to win.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   He was going to make him money, and he was going to start a network as Murdoch.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   That's right.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   And... or Ailes.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   Not Murdoch. Ailes was encouraging him to start his own broadcast network, and he was going to do that.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   And we had heard those rumors.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   It reminds me of... what was that Robert Redford movie where he runs for president?
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   Oh, the candidate.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   The candidate.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   And he wins.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   And the end of the last line in the movie is, "Now what do we do?"
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   And then if you think about it, governing and running are very different, and skill sets and challenges.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   But that's what you want, right?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   You want a president who never actually thought they would win.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   You want a president who actually didn't...
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   Some people didn't want that.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   I mean, that was part of our president's charm, was that he wasn't from the traditional governing class,
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   that he was somebody else, somebody different, somebody who...
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   So you argued in favor of Oprah?
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   I take it, Jeff.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   No, I was praising Howard for saying no Oprah.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   No, enough celebrity.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   Plus, I was also arguing.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   The other reason I called in was that my TV critic days, one forgets that Oprah Winfrey is the one who really opened the door to trashing television.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   In her original...
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   Well, she created Dr. Phil, right?
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   Yeah, and she had really worse trashy stuff than that.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   And she went on and on.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   And so it led to Ricky Lake, and it led to...
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   What's his name?
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   Who was the worst of them?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   People would throw chairs and stuff.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   I know his name.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   He was the son of a famous...
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   And it led to Martin Downey Jr.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   Well, that too, right?
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   So I would argue that Oprah actually opened a door that led straight to Donald Trump.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   Real.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   She also pushed the...
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   Cheers, please.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   As I recall, she helped promote the sort of anti-vax movement as well.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   There's some pretty...
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   There's been some dubious things she's had on.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   And actually, but then one day she saw the burning bush, you know, like investors in Facebook and Google who are now suddenly seeing the light, supposedly.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   She did too.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   And so, oh no, no, no, no.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   I'm not going to be purchased.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   I don't want Deep Rec Chopra as the...
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   How for the...
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   What's Dr. Pause?
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   Yeah, Dr. Pause.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   Well, maybe better than the housing...
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   Had we have now.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   So Oprah was suddenly saw the light.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   After she'd already caused the damage, after she already become number one, after she'd ruined Phil's format.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   And they asked me to come on as a TV critic to praise Oprah.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   Oh, really?
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   Oh, not to it.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   By the PR president.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   Deep God was enraged.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   She's...
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   I feel like...
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.200]   And it's funny, this really is how the pendulum swings.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   We had kind of the ultimate policy wonk in Clinton.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   And then it swung the other way.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   And then we had the ultimate policy wonk in Obama.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   And then it swung the other way.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   And I feel like...
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   Maybe this is another policy wonk in there.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   Somebody would...
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   I mean, Oprah's a lovely person.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   And I'm sure she has lots of fine qualities.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   And I'm sure she gave a great speech.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   But what's she going to do when she has to determine whether to launch a drone strike on somebody or when she has to negotiate pieces in the Middle East?
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.200]   That's fantastic.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   So, in the Matthew, Mr. News Critic, the story here to me is the idiocy of our field.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.200]   She wasn't trying for the 2020.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   She didn't really wasn't.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   She didn't get a good speech.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   But then everybody, like Chris Matthews last night on MSNBC was practically voting for her.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   One of the networks had to take down a tweet that was saying that they were for her.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   Media went crazy immediately because that's the way they are.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   This is stupid.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   This is kind of the risk of the liberal reaction to the Trump presidency is that liberals may then grasp its straws inappropriately.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   So liberal media particularly.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   Yeah, I mean, you're seven-year-old deaf.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   You could give a half-decent speech at a Berkeley Park and the Democrats would be like, "Oh!"
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   They're just so desperate, I tell you.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:08:03.200]   But remember that Barack, a young little-known senator from Illinois named Barack Obama gave a speech at the Democratic Convention in 2004 and woke everybody up.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   And that was the beginning of his rapid ascendancy with very little experience to the presidency.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   And he turned out okay.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   I mean, I have some misgivings about his eight years, but I don't know.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   Who knows?
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   Who knows?
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   It's not even a very long speculation at this point.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   Yeah, I was one of those who was not- I thought there was empty rhetoric, so I was happy.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   I expected little the people who thought he was going to be the god.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   We were more disappointed.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   And by the way, we've just done this opening segment just because I don't know who it was in the chat, but you promised you wouldn't do no politics now and I wanted to be really mad.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   Well, I asked about Stern, but I didn't realize what you had called into Stern about.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   So I thought I just enjoyed what I just did.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   It's my fault.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   However, CES is going on.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   And the really interesting thing is the story of CES, besides today's brief blackout, is- and the rain that preceded it, is that Google is everywhere.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   Google Assistant, not only the advertising is everywhere, they wrapped the mono rail.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   They wrapped the side of the building.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   You can't go anywhere around.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   Yeah, special Google buckets to catch the leaks in the roof.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   But- Hey Google, the mono rail says, but it is also in a lot of stuff.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   And I think this is kind of a one-two punch from Google because they had announced before CES that they had a phenomenal Christmas.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   I think they said 6 million device activation, which puts them right up there with Amazon.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   We don't know exactly what Amazon Echoes penetration is, but 6 million in a couple of weeks.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   That- oh, I guess it was for 2017.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   Pardon me.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   That was for the year.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   That's still phenomenal.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   I think that- I was surprised actually.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   And that's a nine- and the 900% increase during the holiday season over last years.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   So Amazon had a lead, to be honest.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   I thought it was going to be tough.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   I think I said on this show, I thought it was going to be tough for Google Home to catch up.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   Yeah, I don't- well, I mean, we always knew that Amazon had a massive lead because of the number of tasks they had.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   They'd been in the market three years before Google came along or two years before Google came along.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   But what is kind of interesting, and we'd always said, "Well, Google will have an advantage if what you're looking for is an assistant
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   that is smart, right, that knows more than shopping and timers."
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   Right.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   That's the world's knowledge.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   And it knows you well.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   And now Google at CES is showing a lot of devices, including Google Assistant with a display.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   This is from Lenovo.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:08.200]   It's $200, competes head to head with Amazon's Echo Show, which by the way, remember, YouTube was pulled off of on January 1st.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   And it is bigger than the Echo Show at roughly the same price.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   There's a nine-inch version and there's an 11-inch version.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   So this is a really, I think this is a very interesting-
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   That's got a stupid round screen.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   And it feels to me like that's the future is the sort of embedded stuff.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   And the things that work in the car or work in, it's not just a gizmo that sits on your desktop.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   Right.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   So where else that assistant shows up?
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   Right.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   This is not a Google run-downs.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   This is a product from Lenovo using it.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   Which is Google strategy, right, to open up the platform.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   It's made Android bigger.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   This is going to be the same as this is like their anti-apple strategy.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   I also put on the rundown, there was some kind of multi-cooker that has Google Assistant built in.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   A cooker.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   I don't understand what it is exactly.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   Like an instant pot?
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   No.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   No.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   It's a what the hell it wasn't.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   Which is Canadian, by the way.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   Yes.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   That's not for yet.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   The gimme a multi-cooker with Google Assistant.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   What the heck is a multi-cooker?
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   I have no idea.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   Whatever it is.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   Like an instant pot.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   Like an instant.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   Stacy, you're going to buy it.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   No, I don't like that.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   Looks at that.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   Although we saw Amazon in a lot of stuff too, Kohler announced an Amazon Echo enabled bathroom.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   The whole bathroom?
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   The whole bathroom.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   So you could say shower, turn on at 8.30 and have the water be at 98 degrees.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   Like that's so hard.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   It's so hard.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   Well, you can't.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   It's not hard, but I mean...
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   You're so old, Joe.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   There's also a toilet that warms your feet on butt.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   The toilet is pretty freaky.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.200]   And plays music and a bathtub and a faucet.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   It's a flush.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   There is a certain irony to the fact that all of these devices stopped working when the power went out of it.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   Yeah, more than a little iron.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   I do think those voice assistants controlling your home, we've said this before,
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   is a kind of natural use for those.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   Sure.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   So did you see the really ridiculous Google Assistant uniforms?
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   Let me find them.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   These were for people like Booth Babes or what?
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   They're really...
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   Well, no, not Babes.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   There were guys, which is good, but they were...
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   Oh, shoot.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   Oh, here we go.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   Geekwire.com.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   Oh, look, these all white ghoul get up.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.200]   So let me put it in there.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   Who was this?
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   The people at the...
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   Booth people.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   I just put it in the chat.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   The Booth people really...
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   Really?
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   ...an 1870s horror movie, The Booth People.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   Are they Booth hunks if they're not Booth babe?
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   Are they Booth hunks?
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   I apologize.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   I'm saying...
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   Not in this outfit they can't be.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   No.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   Okay, I'll have to keep looking.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   I put it in the chat.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   The chat.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   Okay, let's see here.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   I serve.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.200]   You live to serve.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   There it is.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   Oh, God.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   Isn't that hideous?
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   It looks like where's Waldo and he's wearing like a took.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   That's bizarre.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   Oh, God.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   Is that...
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   Is he a Google employee?
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   Or...
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.200]   That's embarrassing.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   I know.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   I know.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   I know.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   I know.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   This is from Silicon Valley.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   That's not real.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   It's like Handmaid's Tale.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   Yeah, it is.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   Some day all men will dress like this.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   I thought you were going to say they had Google Assistant enabled clothing.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   Well, actually don't they have a jacket with the...
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   But I don't think it's this.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.200]   Google says the assistance available now on 400 million devices.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.200]   Geez.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200]   So...
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   That's because...
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   That includes all of the phones.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   Yeah, it's because 389 million of them are Android devices.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   But still, that means they're getting data from 400 million devices.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   And Amazon can't ever...
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   I can't ever admit.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   That's six million homes were sold since October, late October.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   So, I would say at this point, they are outselling the Echo.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   Or very close to it.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   Yeah, it's impressive.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   And they now have these interesting third-party form factors.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   Yeah, good.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   You know, it's the races on.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   There's no question about that.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   And, you know, there are two horses way in the back of the field called Siri and Cortana.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   And I guess you'd have to include Bixby in that...
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   Who are...
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   So maybe three horses.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   Bixby's not even left the gate.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   Did you see that LG demo with the smart assistant?
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   No.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   The one that wouldn't do anything.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   Let's pull it up.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   It sounds like more CES hilarity ensue.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   Is this the robot?
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   Yeah, let's watch this.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   Even robots have bad days.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.200]   So, LG had a whole kitchen, right?
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   I loved it loud.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   By the way, can I just say the worst name ever, LG Cloy?
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   Cloy, yeah.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Cloey.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   Oh, pardon me, but it's spelled C-L-O-I.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   So, you'll forgive me for calling it Cloy.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   So, it's extra confusing.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   That's what they were going for, I think.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   Cloey.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Am I ready on my washer and cycle?
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   Washer and...
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   Washer and...
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   Washer and cycle.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   Oh, never tried this one.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   Even robots have bad days.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   It's only got fired at that minute.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   Crickets, I think, are added by editorial.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   Cloey is not going to talk to me.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   Cloey doesn't like me, evidently.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   Or is there a good way to go ahead and check in?
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   Oh, he's just a paid actor.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   Oh, he's not a days-second.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   Cloey, are you talking to me yet?
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   What recipes could I make with chicken?
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   [laughter]
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   No.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   Looks like he's got a Jibo over on the left there.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   I guess Cloey...
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   I'm going to find Buffalo Chicken Pizza.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   Buffalo Chicken Pizza sounds good.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   This is why you don't want a...
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   That's Gizmodo's video.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   Never do a lot of...
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.200]   Yeah, and you don't really want to...
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   Again, this underscores how if you're...
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   All your appliances are dependent on...
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.200]   Right.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   ...your resist.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   It's just a bad...
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   When it doesn't work, it really is bad.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.200]   Open the refrigerator door, hell.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   [laughter]
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   I'm sorry, Dave.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   You're too fat.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.200]   [laughter]
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   I'm not going to let you eat.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   Anything else to talk about with CES?
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200]   Let me just quickly see.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   I want to get to this amp letter.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:02.200]   I'm sure you have something to say about this, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   Both of them and the amp...
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   I do not do as well.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   Yeah, amp announcements.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   I just thought it was hugely ironic that power failure.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   I know!
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   Power out at CES and nothing works.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   All these people in the darkened room trying to talk to
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   assistants that don't exist.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   You know, we are creating...
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.200]   I mean, this is kind of a philosophical conversation.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   We are creating kind of a dependent society.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.200]   That's for sure.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   We have been all along technology dependent society,
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   but it's getting...
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   It feels like it's a little more fragile all the time.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   Uh...
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   Chloe.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   Here's my one observation about CES.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   Is this the biggest shrug we've ever had at CES?
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   No, it's almost every year it's a shrug.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   A shrug?
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   A shrug.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   I was at Bummer World took it over, I guess.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   There's...
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   You know, I mean, there's some stuff there,
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   but the problem is it's such a big mishmosh.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   We can't really...
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.200]   We won't really know what was important for a while.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   Remember 3D TV?
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   Well, there...
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   Okay, so there is some TV stuff.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   There's 8K TV.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   It's just like...
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   We all are demanding.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   No.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   And there is a new TV technology that Samsung's showing
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   called MicroLED that will kind of presumably,
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   at some point, replace OLED because it doesn't have some of the drawbacks OLED has.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   But it has...
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   But it's direct view.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   It's using LEDs instead of organic cells that OLED uses.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   Interesting.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   They are gonna... There is gonna be a micro LED TV shipping this year,
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   but it's 146 inches.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   And if you have to ask the price, you're not Shaquille O'Neal.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   So it's not...
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   But it proves the technology works and they'll have more in the years to come.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   I saw...
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   I did order something and I don't know if this was a good idea or not,
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   but I ordered from Anker a $50 device that puts Amazon's Echo in your car.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   It's called the ROWAV ROAV Viva.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   It plugs into a cigarette lighter and has two USB ports of its own.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   So it's kind of like a cigarette lighter charger,
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.200]   but it just happens to have a microphone and it pairs with your Bluetooth speakers in your car.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   And then...
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   And it pairs with your phone?
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   No.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   It's really...
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   How does it reach?
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   You must pair with your phone.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   Yeah, it does.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   You do.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   You plug the device in the vehicle, play it with a smartphone.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   The smartphone's paired with the vehicle.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   The system streams audio from the Viva to the vehicle through this link,
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   even if the smartphone is doing other things.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   It's not a...
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   Spotify deal is not done.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   So it doesn't have Spotify, but I see for me it would be great for audio books,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.200]   because that would... I mean, I kind of live on audio books in the car.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   Yeah, but why do you need that?
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   I have audio books in my car.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.200]   On your phone.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   On your phone.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   Well, just for the ability to command it by voice.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.200]   So what about the...
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   It's 50 bucks.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   You know who app on your phone.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.200]   Wouldn't that do the same thing?
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.200]   They said I guess it wouldn't be listening all the time.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   It wouldn't be listening all the time.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   It's 50 bucks.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   I ordered it pre-ordered it.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   Well, just...
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   Did you...
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.200]   You said last week, Leo, you were going to put Fuchsia on your Pixelbook.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   No, no, I didn't.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   I'll do it.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   I forgot.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   I just forgot.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   You're going to get it and you're going to see what do I do.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   Yeah, that one.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   Well, it's...
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   I got to remind myself.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   Put Fuchsia on my Pixelbook.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   What's Fuchsia?
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.200]   It's a Google operating system that has no parent purpose.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   No.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   But you could put it on your Pixelbook now.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   Just what you need.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   Just what I've always wanted.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   All right, enough.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   Enough.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   But you saw, by the way, that was a good example of a voice assistant being very useful.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:12.200]   I use a little app, but this is an iOS thing, but I use a little app on iOS that has a watch,
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   interface, and does dictation.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   So I tap a button on the face of my watch.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   It's immediately listening.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   I just talk and then it's done.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.200]   And it saves it.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.200]   Then I can on my iOS device later in the day process it all.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   Because it has a very nice bunch of features for putting it in the calendar, putting it
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   in reminders, putting it anywhere you want.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   Just another thing I won't do.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.200]   Oh, but for me, I do do it because I can...
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   Now, this is my personal issue, but I always agree to do stuff.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   Like put Fuchsia on my Pixelbook and then forget it.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   Right?
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   Or you say a great show I should be watching and I go, "Oh, yeah, I got to remember that."
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   And then I don't...
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   The cool wallace.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   Add the cool wallace.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   Oh, yeah, yeah, good, good.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.200]   Watch Nicole Wallace.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   Simple.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   What else should we...
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.200]   How else can we fill up Leo's day off?
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.200]   This happens all the time though.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   People just recommend a book or a movie or whatever.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   And I put it in here and then I have it set up that when I go process...
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   This is an app on iOS called Drafts.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   When I go process it, one of the actions is to put this in a "to read or watch" list.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   So that's...
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.200]   So it means I very quickly process these.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.200]   I don't know, I find this a really good workflow for me because I'm always forgetting stuff.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   You've got to finish a book.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   Go ahead.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   Go ahead.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   First Matthew and then Jeff.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   Do you use Google Keep?
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   I used to.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   Can you do the same kind of thing with Google Keep?
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.200]   If you're all in on iOS, the iOS Reminders app is the best one to use because it does much
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   of the same stuff Keep does.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   And I use other more powerful note taking programs than Keep.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   The problem I don't have with Keep is everything's just kind of there on the page.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   Like dump on the page.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   And I don't know.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   I'm more...
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   Not in my real life, but in my digital life I'm more...
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   Add a note to Google Keep.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   It's good for notes though.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200]   No, can't take notes yet.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   Can't take notes yet.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   Okay.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   See, I think voice...
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.200]   This is an example of why voice is powerful.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.200]   There are times when you just...
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   I want to just say...
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.200]   I tap my watch and say, "Dude,ude,ude."
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   And then it will be preserved in a reliable way for me when I have some time at the end
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   of the day to go through it all and add it to my to-do list or my calendar or whatever
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   it needs.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   I mean, you could dictate...
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   I can dictate an email this way and then send it out and stuff like that.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   I don't know.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   It's just...
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   I have a new book to recommend to you.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   Yes.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   Let me add it to my.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   Go ahead.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   "Revolution Song" by Russell Shorto.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   Russell Shorto's "Revelution Song."
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   Russell Shorto.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   So the only problem with this is...
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   "Dictation is imperfect."
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   So I have "Rush of Short, I Was Revolution Song."
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   But see, I will then...
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   That'll trigger.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   Oh yeah, that was that thing Jeff said.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   It was...
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   Good book.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   What's it about?
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   It's about the American Revolution.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   Russell Shorto wrote a magnificent book about the Dutch history of New York City.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   Oh, I read that book and I loved it.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   Then he wrote another one about Amsterdam and the world's most liberal city.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   The island at the center of the world was...
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   That was the New York City history book.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   Wonderful.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   Great book.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   I want to put up a statue to Adriana van der Donck.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   What was it?
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   Yeah, what's neat is that the Dutch are particularly anal-retentive and took notes on everything.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   Yes.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   And they eventually found these and he went through them and he was able to create a very good...
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   Oh, I want to read this.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.200]   Revolution Song.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   That's the revolution.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.200]   So he has like six intermingled stories.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   He has George Washington, a freed African American slave, a woman who went back and forth, a guy
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   who was anti-federalist, the head of the British effort to defeat us.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   And they all intermingled.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   He's just really good.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   He's great.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   I happen to have an audible credit right here.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   And don't forget I had recommended Boucherie Novashin.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   I own that now.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.200]   You do own the Americana, right?
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   I think you'll like that.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.200]   I think you'll like that a lot.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   Americana.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   Yeah, actually...
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   How is the audio version in terms of performance of fire and fury?
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   Terrible.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   But doesn't matter.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   Well, you know why you could tell they...
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   It's not terrible.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   No, I apologize.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   It's fine.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   But you could tell they rushed it out because there are a lot of audio typos.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   The guy pronounces indefatigable for some reason as indefatigable.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   And every time he says it, it's like...
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   And there's a few words like that where you can tell...
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.200]   And I think that's probably happens always when they do audio books.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   But they just didn't have time because they...
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   They're becoming so much better produced.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   Are we talking about this the latest John Lecare?
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   Yes, and that's also...
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   I have that on my laptop.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   It's really well produced.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   And so it's more of a performance.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   I love it.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   And so you compare that now to schmoves like me reading an audio book.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.200]   The worst part of the audio book is that also where I had it with the inserts.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   And you can tell it's the next day and the voice is different than the rumors.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   That's terrible.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   That's bad production.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.200]   And then General Washington...
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   When?
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   And...
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   I do hear that.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   I have to say I do.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   I know.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.200]   Oh, that was next time.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   That was later that day.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.200]   Okay, good.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   I just got the Yesherto book.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   Because I do love...
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   We have filled up Leo's weekend.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.800]   Well, the problem is you should see my audible list.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.200]   There's a hundred books I haven't read yet.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   So...
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   I read Christopher Walken's...
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   Christopher Walken has a book?
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.200]   No, I always want him to narrate all of the other books.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.200]   Yeah, great.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   Does he ever do audiobooks?
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   Because then I went to a...
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.200]   That would be funny.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.200]   I wonder.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   Let's see.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   Let's see if Christopher Walken has ever...
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   No, he's never narrated an audiobook.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   He's too big time.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   It'd be great.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   Oh, I'm looking for...
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   Oh, well, but...
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.200]   Okay, hold on.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   Hold on.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   Search Christopher Walken.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.200]   So...
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.200]   Wait.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   We're thinking...
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   You want to hear him reading the...
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   Raven.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   Raven.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   That's what I was looking for.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   That's what I was waiting for.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   Oh, for Raven.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   Oh, for Raven, ever more.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.200]   I like the thunder.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   [Sighs]
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   Once upon a midnight dreary,
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   while I pondered weak and eerie,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   over many acquaintance and curious volumes of a cotton lure,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.200]   while I nodded nearly napping.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   Nearly napping.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   Suddenly, they came...
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   Attacking.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   There's an awful lot of satisfaction.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   I just want to get you racking.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   I just want to get you racking.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   I've got a better one.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   Where the wild things are read by him.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   The next one down on the Google search.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   Oh, that would be amazing.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   That's more him.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   Scary little children.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.200]   You know, I read an interview with Maurice Sendek.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   He was originally where the wild ponies are.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   Really?
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   But he couldn't draw ponies.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   [Laughs]
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.200]   So, he ended up making something he could draw.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.200]   God may not even be saints.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.200]   I'm mad.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   That very night in Max's room,
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   a forest grew.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   A forest grew.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   In the picture you can see that the posts of his bed
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   have turned into some kind of birch trees.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   Turned into death.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.200]   I assumed because they're thin.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   They're thin.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   They're thin.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   Or dead.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200]   But...
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   You know what? I am going to memorize this.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.200]   This is how you learn how to do a Christopher Walken impression.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   Some birch trees.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.200]   Burch trees.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.200]   Death thin.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   Death thin.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.200]   The reason that he does...
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   There's just a little text and a lot of pictures.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   So, the poor guy is stuck kind of...
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   He's in a boat.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   He looks pleased with himself.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.200]   He looks very happy to be there.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   There's another tree out in the middle of the water.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   I don't know why.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   I don't know why.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   That's brilliant.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   Ah! I can't wait!
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   Where the wild things are.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   I don't know why.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.200]   I don't know why.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   I don't know why.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   This is the wackyest tangent...
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   I'm trying.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   We've never done.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   I was going to do an ad.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   And now I will.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   And then we'll talk about why the bicycles keep disappearing from the Google campus.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:52.200]   But first, a word from Matthew Ingram's favorite folks up there in Toronto.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   And mine too.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   Fresh books.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.200]   It was in Toronto I discovered them.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   I was going to Rogers one week a month doing a call for help up there.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   And it was always a pain at the end of the month to send out the invoice because I had to do it in Canadian dollars.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   And I had to also add all the expenses.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   And it was just...
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   I would put it off and sometimes I wouldn't bill them for months at a time.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   And it was Amber.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   Amber MacArthur who said, "There's this new startup.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.200]   This is 2004.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   There's this new startup in Toronto.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   Fresh books.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   You've got to try this."
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   Because they make it easy to do all your invoices.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   It's really...
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   It was.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   It saved my life.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   I got...
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Finally, it turns out if you don't do the invoice, you don't get paid.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   Now, Fresh books has really expanded.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   They have 10 million customers.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   And it really is as much if you look at the dashboard accounting.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   But I hate...
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   I almost hate saying that because you don't want to do accounting.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   Nobody does.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   But Fresh books does it for you because it turns out in the process of getting your invoices together and your expenses, you've got really all the profit and loss of the cost.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:56.200]   All the profit and loss stuff you need to know, for instance, are you making a profit this week?
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   A lot of people, a lot of small business people don't know that until the end of the year's old tax time.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.200]   With Fresh books, you could send professional looking invoices in seconds.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   You get paid faster because you can accept credit cards.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   Those invoices have a pay me button.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.200]   As a result, you get paid an average of twice as fast.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   You don't have to chase clients for payments or wait in line at the bank.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.200]   You can accept credit card payments right from the invoice.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   And actually clients love this too because paying bills is no more fun than making bills.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   Truth is, you'll always know which invoices have been sent, which have been paid, even which have been viewed.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   So there's no more saying, "I didn't get your invoice, which are overdue.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   They will have automatic ticklers that go out to your client that say, "Hey, you know, you're overdue."
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   And they can get increasingly angry if you wish.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   You could create proposals now in Fresh books.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:53.200]   Because it's an online system, they add new features almost every day.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   This new proposal's feature is awesome.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.200]   Rich text content, images, customizable sections.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   You make a proposal to a client and it automatically feeds right in.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   When they say, "Yes," it feeds right into your invoicing.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   And it showcases, for your prospective clients, how good you look and you win more jobs.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   Know what you did.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   Know when you did it.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   Never leave money on the table again.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   Fresh books does the hard work for you.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.200]   All you gotta do is make those invoices.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.200]   You can track expenses with the Fresh books app, take a picture of their seat,
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   goes right into the invoice, assign services to projects, even different rates for every service.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   Basically, it's putting your business on autopilot.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   You do the stuff you love that you got into business for, let Fresh books do.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   Payment reminders, late fees, automate it all so you can get back to doing what you want to do.

[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   And if you would, do us a favor and put this week in Google in the form when they say, "How did you hear about us?"
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.200]   That would help.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   Yes, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. Fresh books.com/twig.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   And we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   People won't stop stealing bikes.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   I don't know why you would want it.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.200]   Well, they're kind of cool.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   Oh, I get it.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   Oh, they're the coolest bikes.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.200]   The larcidist thought has passed my mind, but obviously someone would know where you got it.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.200]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   It's got blue tires, green fender, yellow frame, pink.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   Oh, it's gonna be so cool.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   They should sell them.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   That's what they're supposed to do.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   That's what there's the solution.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   This is a credit on Wall Street Journal.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   Google is constantly hunting for missing bikes.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   At any time, there are around 1,100 of them on the campus.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.200]   That's so employees, because it's a big campus, can go from place to place.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   But each week, about 10% to 20% disappear.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:56.200]   Many of the other local lawns, roofs of local hotspots.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   Somebody spotted one in a TV commercial, one resident who happens to work at Oracle,
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   and he described the bikes as a friendly gesture to the community.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   Even Mountain View's mayor, that's the city of the Googles, and has admitted to taking one
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   of the movies off campus.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   Local police didn't want to help, so GPS trackers have been put on the bike.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   I hope they're trackers.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   They should provide free bikes.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   They should just provide free bikes for the whole community.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   How much can it cost for this bike?
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   They can afford it.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   100 bucks.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   The other thing is they have a whole staff that does nothing but rebalance the bike distribution
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   every night.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   Nice.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   They're testing a system that's kind of like the city bike system.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   You unlock it with your smartphone.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   The real problem is...
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   That feels so depressing.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   It's cool.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   You go to Google, and they're just there.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   In front, somebody just rode up, and you just hop on it.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   I always wondered, is it okay to just hop on it and ride off?
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   Or is the expectation that the employee who rode it there will be able to ride it back?
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   No, I've been told that you just pick one and hop on.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.200]   You can't tell them what part.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   They're all the same.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   There was a little problem earlier, and this may be why Google wants to lock it down with
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   bikes being dumped into the local creek.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   That looks bad.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   That's not good.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   That's mean.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   It's just bad.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   You know what?
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   You know, in Amsterdam, they dredge the canals periodically and take out thousands and thousands
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   of bikes.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   Other things.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   Yeah, and other things.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   Bikes are all over Amsterdam.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   That's one of the things I love about Holland, Denmark's the same way Finland's the same way
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   they're bikes.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   More people own bikes.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.200]   It's amazing how cultural is when I was in Estonia, when I was in...
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   It's also flat right on the water.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   No bikes.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   Didn't see a single bike.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   Really?
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   How one culture goes crazy with them and the one not far away doesn't.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   One other CES story I didn't mention.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.040]   Huawei, which is the big Chinese...
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.200]   It's the number three smartphone manufacturer in the world, not in the US.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:08.000]   They had made a deal for the Mate 10, their brand new high-end phone, to sell it through
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.600]   AT&T and Verizon.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.800]   So what happened?
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   Congress.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.000]   Yeah, can we know why?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Congress.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.040]   AT&T pulled out of the deal.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.640]   We think because right before CES, by the way, we think...
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:29.840]   Yeah, because remember, Congress had written a letter like two years ago saying, "Be careful
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:36.040]   of the Chinese-owned companies like Xiaomi, Huawei, and partly because Chinese military
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.120]   owns part of them."
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:45.480]   And apparently, the CEO of Huawei, who was speaking at CES, doing the demo of the Mate
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:52.360]   10, at the end, he goes off script and gets furious.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:38:00.160]   He says, "Hey, we worked really hard to get this phone successful around the world, and
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.560]   now here we are.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.560]   Everybody knows you.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.320]   Without carrier deals, you can't sell a phone in the United States successfully."
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.960]   And Verizon is apparently considering...
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.560]   Here's a little bit of his...
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   Oh, yeah, you can't...
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.080]   I'm sorry, this sound is too echo-y.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.080]   I won't play it.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.320]   This is from the Verge.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.960]   But Richard Yu, who's the CEO of the Consumer Products Division, spent according to the
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.880]   Verge, Vlad Zwav writing at the Verge, "An hour mumbling his way through an awkwardly scripted
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.560]   presentation of the Mate 10 Pro.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.680]   He stammered, he hesitated, he was obviously uncomfortable on stage.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:45.400]   But then at the end, he said, "Well, there's one thing I want to share with you."
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.800]   The teleprompter stopped showing any text, and he talked about the failure of the carrier
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   deal.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.960]   Shitting the earlier hesitation of his speech, Zwav writes, "He made the point that American
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.480]   phone buyers can't have the best and widest choice of devices if Huawei products, those
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.440]   are the world's third biggest phone vendor we're not on offer."
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.920]   Everybody knows in the United States market that over 90% of smartphones are sold by carrier
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.920]   channels.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.360]   It's a big loss for us and also for carriers, but the more big loss is for consumers, because
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.840]   consumers don't have the best choice.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.880]   Is it supposedly a security concern or is it a trade thing?
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.880]   Well...
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.120]   Probably a bit of both.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:28.280]   I mean, first of all, if you're asking Congress to tell you what the security issues are in
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.240]   a phone, you're asking the wrong person.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:39.000]   But the point's taken, we talked about don't buy Kaspersky antivirus because of their...
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.520]   But the phone's a little different because first of all, every phone you use is...
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.320]   It's an iPhone, it's made in China.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.320]   In China.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.320]   Now, somebody...
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.880]   I tweeted that and somebody said, "Well, yeah, but there's a difference between having
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.760]   assembled in China and the Chinese control of firmware."
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   Well, yeah, maybe.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:59.040]   If they're assembling it at Foxconn, there's nothing to stop Foxconn from.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.640]   I think if there were something going on in the Huawei phone, we would...
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:09.520]   I'm sure many a security pro has taken it apart and knocked on it and tried to figure
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.520]   it out.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.600]   I'm sure it's safe, but...
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.840]   I'm not sure I would use a Chinese-made router.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.560]   I would probably use a Chinese-made phone.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.560]   I agree.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.560]   Well, where are the routers?
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.560]   I don't know.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.400]   Where is this?
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   You can get...
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.040]   Well, I use TP-Link routers, but I think that's Taiwan, not China.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   So...
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.960]   I mean, look, at some point, everything's going to be made in China.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.920]   It's an interesting question.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.800]   I think a lot of it is trade policy.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.600]   And there is definitely a kind of climate in Washington, an anti-Chinese climate in
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:53.400]   Washington, backed out of TPP, which was a trade deal with China.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:59.160]   Not that I was crazy about TPP, TPP because of the IP restrictions.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:05.280]   But nevertheless, I think there's a strong point to be made that free trade with countries
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.760]   is good for peace, if not for economies.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.480]   I think it's good for both.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:16.120]   But a country that's making a lot of money trading with you is much less likely, I think,
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   to attack you, right?
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.400]   It's a good story.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:28.080]   Well, we lost negotiating ability because the main thing, the main diplomatic, for somebody
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:34.040]   on MSNBC said this today is the main diplomatic pressure we had on China was the economic pressure
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   trade.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.040]   Yeah, trade.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.200]   Yeah, I think it's dumb to unilaterally back out of it.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   You negotiate.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   You sit down.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   You negotiate.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.280]   In any event, I don't know whether it's trade or security.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.480]   The Mate 10 Pro is supposed to be a very nice phone.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:54.400]   It has a F1.6 Leica made camera in it.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.280]   And I think that there was going to sell, you can still buy it in the US, you just can't
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.040]   buy it from AT&T.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.800]   And apparently there's political pressure on Verizon also to back out of that deal.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:08.480]   It's a little disturbing that the government is going around pressuring companies like AT&T
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.400]   to do deals with this country, but not that country.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.600]   I guess that's not anything unusual though.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.400]   It's a funny kind of pressure.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.480]   It's not saying don't do it.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:22.560]   It's saying there are security concerns about these Chinese phones.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:27.480]   They are, you know, Huawei is apparently partially owned by the Chinese military.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.960]   And it's also, hey, that's a nice business you got there.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.920]   Hate for anything to happen to it.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:41.160]   I mean, there's a lot to be said about China's rogue nation in some respects.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.520]   Certainly intellectual property rights are not protected in China.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.480]   But again, if you walk away from the table, you can't, there's no good way to deal with
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.480]   that.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.680]   And I don't think you cannot deal with China.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.440]   It's a big, big market.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.200]   Yeah, no, but you got to do it in a savvy way.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   I don't know.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   I don't know.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:05.120]   Anyway, you could still buy the Huawei Mate 10 Pro because they're going to sell it online.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.200]   But most, as you know, most consumers don't take, people listen to this show take the time
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.400]   to find out what's available.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.400]   But most people just say, what do you got?
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:18.120]   And at a best buy, everything is carrier tied, right?
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.200]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.560]   The carriers wield a huge amount of power in this country.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   All the sites of that.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.560]   It's all sorts of things.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.560]   Getting bigger.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.480]   Even worse in Canada.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.800]   Londog says that's what they taught me in high school.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.000]   More trade provides economic dependency on the two countries.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.880]   And this is all part of being a global economy where every country would be tied to another
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.880]   country.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.000]   But what they didn't teach you says, Londog in our chatroom is that once you're dependent
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.920]   on this other country, you're sort of powerless to do anything against them also.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.480]   I disagree.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.040]   It's an interdependencies relationship.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   Interdependency, yeah.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.040]   It's a relationship.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   Right.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.480]   It's like saying, don't get every, never get married because then your wife is going
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.600]   to control you.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   That's not true.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.960]   It's a relationship.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   On the other hand.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   Hi for one.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.240]   Welcome my new master.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.000]   Speaking of which, speaking of which, the story that got me this week was the James Daymoor.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Okay.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Let's talk about it.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.400]   He's filing a lawsuit, a class action lawsuit against Google saying it discriminates against
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   white male conservatives.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   Oh yeah.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:33.000]   The more was the guy who wrote the very controversial memo saying that we probably should think
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.760]   about how we hire women because women really aren't suited to technical positions.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.320]   At the time, didn't people say to you, well, Leo, did you read the whole memo?
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.920]   He makes a few points.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.920]   It's all right.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:51.400]   It was straight out of this men's rights BS and showing his true colors.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.000]   Racist misogynist, there it is.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.720]   So it amazes me.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.480]   And I don't think it's gotten the kind of attention that I think it should get as a follow up
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.120]   to what the coverage of him was at the time.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:07.200]   He's joined by another former Google engineer, David Goodman, who worked on a query engine
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.200]   there.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.440]   He left the company in 2016.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.680]   You know, I am in the lawsuit says it's a class action suit representing all employees
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.680]   of Google who have been discriminated against due to their perceived conservative political
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.480]   views by Google, their male gender by Google and their Caucasian race.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.880]   Did you look at the suit at all?
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.880]   No.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.880]   No.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:34.080]   So one of the things he mentions is he's got emails that appear to indicate that Google
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:44.760]   had a blacklist of conservative or right wing people that were flagged whenever their name
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.120]   was entered into the system and then escorted off the premises.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.240]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.800]   I don't believe that.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   Hmm.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.640]   Well, we'll see.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:00.320]   I mean, I feel like he became a poster boy, didn't he?
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:06.040]   And I'm sure that's I don't know if he thought this up himself or if somebody came along
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:10.000]   and said, you know, let's let's foot this bit.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   Who knows?
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Peter Thiel, my thing.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.920]   The latter Peter Thiel might have said, Hey, I got a little extra money.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.640]   I saw somewhere that he had met with Peter Thiel.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.440]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:24.240]   But I did see a rumor to that effect asked.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.240]   They asked.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.240]   Let's see.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.240]   Who's this?
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:30.360]   Deimor's attorney is Harmeet Dylan.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.440]   He's a California representative for the Republican National Committee.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.520]   He was asked who's financing the suit.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.160]   And he told TechCrunch in an email, quote, nobody but my law firm is financing the suit
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.160]   at this time.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.560]   We may choose to seek funding in the future, but neither Peter Thiel.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:51.280]   I've been asked by others or anyone else has involved besides my clients and my firm.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.080]   Well, there you go.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.520]   I wonder how a court would treat this.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:05.320]   You'd have to you'd really have to demonstrate that there was a persistent pattern of this.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:11.600]   But if you could, that wouldn't be good.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.760]   But is but is affirmative.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:17.000]   See, I think this is kind of the conservative point of view of affirmative action in general.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.080]   Why every time you hire a minority, they're going to argue that it was it was discrimination
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.520]   against white Canada, right?
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   Which is certified as a class action first.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.800]   It doesn't have to get a court to agree that you have standing to launch a class action.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   That's right.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.840]   So this is early days yet.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.640]   Let's talk about AMP.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:45.000]   This is AMP as as you know, we've talked a lot about it, including we had the head of
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.440]   Google's news operation, Richard Gingreson, to defend AMP because I was even from day one
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.240]   thought, yeah, I'm not.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.600]   You were probably I'm not crazy about this idea.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:02.360]   AMP is designed to speed up mobile browsing by and by the way, my blog is has AMP because
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.240]   I'm on WordPress and that was just a plug in.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.600]   So I checked the box.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:11.440]   So if you load my blog on AMP, Google restricts certain image types, restricts all JavaScript,
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.800]   except for certain stuff coming from Google servers.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   They say it's open.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.000]   You can run your own AMP server, but I don't know anybody who does.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.840]   They also point out that AMP degrades well.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:27.720]   So if you don't have a browser that supports AMP, you'll get still the normal page.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.480]   It's not like they're cutting you off from the rest of the world.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:36.200]   But here's a letter from, well, I don't.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.560]   There's lots and lots of names on it.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.040]   I have not seen one yet.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.640]   I don't know if you have Matthew that looked familiar to me from our business.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.160]   You know, it's mostly developers and programmers.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.160]   Okay.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.840]   On behalf of the organizations, I don't see some media company people, but I don't.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:55.840]   Two organizations involved Article 19 and the Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:03.320]   I don't again know these people are, but it says we are deeply concerned about AMP
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:07.200]   because it keeps users within Google's domain, diverts traffic away from other websites for
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.200]   the benefit of Google.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:12.600]   And at the scale of billions of users, it has the effective further reinforcing Google's
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.000]   dominance of the web.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.520]   We acknowledge the problem of pages being slow to load.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.120]   Relative to alternative proprietary technologies like Facebook's Instant Articles and Apple
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.400]   News.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.920]   Publishers have always faced long and long faced difficult choices and poor incentives, leading
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.520]   to bad decisions and compromises, ultimately to terrible user experiences.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.880]   The AMP format is not in itself a problem, but there are two things they do say are a
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.880]   problem.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.120]   One of the things that opts in the AMP and the associated hosting within Google's domain
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.640]   is, and this is a problem I brought up too, is granted preferential search promotion.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.040]   And this is where I think they're most right, yes.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.840]   Because there's a bar, right?
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.240]   An AMP, you know, bar at the top of the search results.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:01.320]   And secondly, when a user navigates from Google to a piece of content Google has recommended,
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.640]   they are unwillingly still within Google's ecosystem.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.840]   And Google's addressed that, I think, with the URL.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:08.840]   They did.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.200]   They're not really, I'll quibble with that one.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.400]   You're not really in Google's ecosystem, you're just, you just have a Google URL.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:19.000]   It's not a Google page and the sense that Google puts ads on it or claims credit for
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   it or any of that.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.920]   But it has been a problem.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:26.240]   And Google did announce, maybe coincidentally with this, that they, I don't know how they're
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:32.760]   going to do it, but they had to change browsers to do this to change so the URL will stay
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.760]   in the publishers.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.760]   It's always been important.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:36.760]   They're right.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.920]   And the letter is, I think, has a really good point about the promotion.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.200]   And I've complained about this from the very beginning.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.240]   That it should not be, you should be promoted because you have a fast page, not because
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.480]   you have an AMP page.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.400]   So, so that's what Google says.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:54.800]   When I talk to Richard about this, he specifically said, the signals that Google looks at in
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.840]   terms of putting things at the top or in the carousel are speed.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:03.440]   So coincidentally enough, Google AMP pages are really fast.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.440]   That's.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.520]   And how else do you get such a fast page?
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.520]   Right.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.160]   So they've got to have an open way to promote speed on the web, which I think is God's
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.160]   work.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.160]   We all agree with that.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.680]   They've got to get rid of the URL, which they say they've done.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.000]   So I think they're making improvements.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.640]   They're listening.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:24.040]   His point was if you could speed up your pages yourself by using something similar, but not
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.280]   AMP, they would also show up high.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.480]   So it wasn't just the AMP, the fact that you were using AMP.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.400]   But is that possible, Matthew?
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.440]   That's, you know, is AMP is such a.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:38.600]   If you just had text on your pages, if it was a static page, it should load faster than
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.600]   anything.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:44.800]   Take out all the JavaScript, take out all the ads and then it'll load really fast.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.560]   I mean, they'll make the money, but yeah.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.560]   Right.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.640]   And the other, so the other thing they don't mention in there that I have heard as a criticism
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:52:00.000]   is that Google, it is technically open source, but Google is effectively directing it in
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.280]   their implementing ad requirements that effectively benefit them.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.800]   Right.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.640]   Which I agree with.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.120]   You can read this letter at ampletter.org.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:16.880]   And you can also read the Google response about the URL.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.360]   I just, I just went to a CNN page and it now is AMP.CNN.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.040]   It's already implemented.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:32.520]   It's a similar, I have a similar problem with Google talking about what it's doing for the
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:35.600]   web and the things it's doing that are good.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.160]   So for example, ad blocking in Chrome.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.480]   Blocking crappy ads is good.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.120]   It's good for users.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:46.400]   But presumably, no Google ads will be blocked.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   Right.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.320]   And so to have those measures implemented by one of the world's largest ad companies seems
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.800]   a little like a conflict to me.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   Yep.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.360]   They argued some time ago that the publishers should create an ad blocker and thus hold
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.360]   to standards.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.360]   But we don't do that.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.360]   And let's face it.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:11.200]   I mean publishers are to blame the reasons that AMP and instant articles could get so
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:16.840]   much traction is because publishers websites are terrible.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:26.960]   Google in a related story stops serving ads from a shady rehab clinic in the UK following
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:32.760]   investigative report after announcing in September a temporary ban on those ads in the United
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   States.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:41.680]   So, you know, the last line of the AMP letter really is the line that matters most to me,
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.000]   which is the web is not Google and should not just be Google.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.400]   And we're really seeing a salt in many directions on a free and open internet, a free and open
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.400]   web.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.400]   And you know what?
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.400]   Stop just Google.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.400]   I don't think just that.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.800]   I don't know if it's that or not.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:06.360]   I mean, if it has the impact of that, whether it's Google's intent, you start to say, Matthew,
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.360]   we see it somewhere else.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.360]   Where else?
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.360]   I was just saying it's not just Google.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.360]   It's Facebook too.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.360]   I mean, that's Facebook.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.360]   It's articles.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.360]   It's literally Facebook.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.880]   They don't even ever link out.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.800]   I mean, they blatantly don't link out of Facebook.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.800]   Right?
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:30.760]   In fact, they've spent a long time hiding links, making it difficult to see the canonical link,
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:35.920]   making it hard for people to click and move off the platform because they want to keep
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:36.920]   you within the ecosystem.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.920]   I mean, if you blame Google for doing something a little bit like that, you got to blame Facebook
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.960]   for doing something a lot like that.
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:52.480]   Well, I would say both are, you know, I've been critical of both and I do think we just
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.880]   need to be aware of it because it's such a great, the open web and the open net is such
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.720]   a great resource.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.720]   We need to defend it.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:06.120]   Obviously, we need to defend it against all attacks, whether it's from the FCC.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.640]   Did Ajit Pai give his speech at CES?
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.360]   No, no, he wouldn't go because he got death threats.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.080]   But then there was some thought he might do it by a Skype.
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.760]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:21.760]   That would be pretty funny, especially if it's got slowed down.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.440]   Yeah, especially if we got slowed down.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.440]   No, he didn't go.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.440]   He didn't.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.440]   He didn't.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.440]   He should have used the telepresence bot.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.440]   The little robot coming out.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.440]   I imagine Pai.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:40.800]   So he's not only did he see, so this kind of does put lie to the reason.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.600]   He said, "Well, I can't do it because it's not safe."
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.960]   But he didn't even make an appearance via tele…
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:47.720]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:53.160]   So what he doesn't really… what's not safe is he doesn't want to talk about it.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:56:03.360]   The session was a FCC/FTC super session with FTC Acting Chair Maureen Allhausen and Gary
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.840]   Shapiro of the CTA.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.400]   But nobody from the FCC.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.560]   There.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:13.640]   And of course, they talked about net neutrality.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:20.080]   Shapiro opened the event saying possibly no other session in CES history has gotten as
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:25.200]   much pre-show attention as this one.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:29.960]   But he said, "Ojib Pai has faced some horrible situations involving some personal threats
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.080]   to his life and his kids and his home.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   That's a shame.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:38.940]   Please, if you want to fight for net neutrality, don't do it by attacking a person or even
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:43.840]   worse their family."
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.240]   The CTA's position on net neutrality?
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.240]   That's tough, right?
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:51.600]   Because the Consumer Technology Association represents Verizon, among others.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:57.960]   This is a very complex issue in terms of nuance under any scenarios, as Gary Shapiro.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.760]   Republicans and Democrats agree on the most fundamental basic principles of being able
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.920]   to get what you should get.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.920]   Whatever that means.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:08.940]   The assignment here was write something as long as possible, no one will read it.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:09.940]   No sense.
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:10.940]   No matter what.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:11.940]   No idea what we have.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.860]   No matter which laws evolve over time, there's the backup of the FCC, the backup of Congress,
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.660]   and there's the bipartisan agreement on the basic fundamental principles, which I haven't
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.660]   stated.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:25.660]   But something like being able to get what you should get is the tautological fundamental
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.620]   principle.
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:32.780]   And you should have what you have, and you should see what you see.
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:34.780]   And you should say what you mean.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.960]   Oh, yeah, he left that one out.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.660]   Yeah, I understand.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:39.660]   Poor Gary.
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:46.680]   I mean, he's got to represent all the companies involved in this.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.260]   Mark Zuckerberg has a personal challenge every year.
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:56.940]   What was it one year he was going to hunt and kill all the meat that he would eat?
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.440]   And then last year, I think it was to create an AI that would run his house.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.640]   And he learned Mandarin.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.640]   He learned Mandarin.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:07.620]   Did that very, I would say arguably that was the most effective.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:11.860]   This year is is is challenge fixing Facebook.
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.060]   Good luck with that.
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:20.100]   Well, I admire him for saying there's something wrong with Facebook.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.100]   But what is it?
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.100]   Couldn't that have been his challenge last year or the year before or the year before
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:27.100]   that?
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:32.220]   Well, Harry Milberer on on MSNBC has been, I think, in some ways too tough on Zuckerberg
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.200]   and Facebook, but he did a good response to that.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.200]   And he said, good, Mark, good.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.200]   You know, you've done this.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.800]   He said every other one of your challenges has had a goal and a metric.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.800]   We don't see that here.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.800]   Yes.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.800]   What's the goal?
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   Excellent.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:45.800]   What's the metric for success?
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.800]   And I think it was a fair challenge.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.600]   How do you measure it?
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.120]   Two marks, Dr. Birkin, say, OK, identify what the problem is and tell us how you're going
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.320]   to see when you fix it.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.880]   I mean, I think that it's a it's obviously a very amorphous challenge in terms of saying,
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.120]   how do I get rid of bad actors better?
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.220]   And how do we support better community?
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.940]   That's pretty amorphous.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:08.900]   But I think Milberer has a point that that, OK, then let's start to make it tangible the
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:13.980]   way you engineers do and judge your success, your progress.
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:15.620]   Peter Drucker.
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.260]   I will invoke Peter Drucker.
[00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:24.580]   Great management expert who said all goals have to be smart, specific, measurable, achievable,
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:26.700]   relevant and time-bound.
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.620]   We've got time-bound.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.020]   We certainly have relevance.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:32.220]   Don't know about the measure.
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.680]   Oh, now I'm going to get a free 2018 light plant toolkit.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.320]   Thank you very much.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:42.120]   I don't know about measurable and achievable, but achievable, maybe a measurable.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.120]   How?
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.120]   That's the question.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.120]   How?
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.000]   I can't remember if it was Drucker.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.920]   Someone said culture eats strategy for breakfast.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.520]   It sounds like a Drucker.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.520]   So Facebook's culture is not going to change overnight.
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.280]   Very good point.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.180]   Well, and look, you know, Mark's capable of taking on big challenges.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.180]   This is a big one.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.180]   Yeah, the first thing is what's wrong with Facebook.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.180]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:14.240]   And I think it comes around to what is Facebook's public responsibility.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.040]   That's what I want to hold them to.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.480]   They are such a major force in the world now.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.080]   Then how are they being misused?
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.280]   How can they be better used?
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.960]   How can they have a positive impact?
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.360]   How can he mitigate the negative impact?
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.360]   They'll always be negative in fact.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.720]   You're never going to get rid of trolls.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.720]   You're never going to get rid of spammers.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.600]   You're never going to get rid of people who are going to exploit a system.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.040]   That's not going to be perfect.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.880]   But what are the goals for the company and how do you inculcate that?
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.640]   I think it's a fair challenge.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.720]   Well, one thing Facebook can't get rid of.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.520]   M, it's AI-consular.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.160]   Remember when they announced this?
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.000]   There's a big deal.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.400]   Remember when chatbots were the next big thing?
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.520]   I think it was even...
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.400]   I was excited at the FA conference where they were talking about it and it didn't take me
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.400]   more than a few days to go, "Ew."
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.560]   I wasn't alone apparently.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.400]   Chatbots have some merit if they're done right.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:16.840]   I still use a couple of chatbots, but in general, this is not a great user interface.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.400]   The interesting thing was M was mostly human beings.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.400]   Right.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.080]   It wasn't actually AI at all.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.880]   It was human beings pretending to be robots.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.400]   They wanted to bake at AI.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400]   But I think they never...
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.200]   One reason to kill it is probably expensive.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:41.120]   They're going to have M suggestions, which is a feature that benefits from all of the
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.760]   M conversations it's had over the last couple of years.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   Did you ever use M?
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.760]   No.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   Did you?
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.760]   No.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.760]   Was it just iPhone?
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.280]   No, I don't think so.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:02:00.760]   I think it was any Facebook messenger if you got approved for it.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.920]   Here's the example from BuzzFeed.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.360]   I don't know if this really is one.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.880]   M says, "How's your day going so far?"
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.560]   You say, "Not bad, kind of busy, and I'm hangry."
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.080]   Then M gives you a button to order food.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.080]   Okay.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.920]   I mean, I don't want to have that conversation, frankly.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.480]   I just want to press the button that says "Order Food."
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.360]   I could see chat functions.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:30.200]   Do you think chat functions will make their way into Google Assistant and Amazon Echo?
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   Wow.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.200]   No.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:40.400]   I'll tell you what I really want to see.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.120]   I'm going to start actively lobbying for this.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.560]   Because right now we have this Tower of Babel where you have different assistants, different
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.920]   commands, different capabilities.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.440]   What I want, and I think we were talking about this on Windows Weekly, Microsoft, given that
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:02.080]   they're Apple, given that they've lost the race, should pivot and say, "But we're going
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.880]   to give you a meta assistant."
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.960]   You talk to Cortana and it will figure out which assistant does the thing you want it
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.320]   to do and it will hand it off and say, "Do that for Leo."
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.800]   I don't want to talk to them all.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.160]   I don't want to remember the syntax for all of them.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.160]   Nobody does.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160]   It's too complicated.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.800]   It's like speaking French, German and English all at the same time.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:29.280]   I want one assistant who's smart enough to figure out how to do what I want.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.280]   That's kind of what M could have been.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.840]   Does that make sense?
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.440]   I think it's too bad that these things are creating effectively new silos.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440]   They're silos, yeah.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.800]   The same way we had with instant messaging that we need to have.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.800]   Is it surprising?
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.960]   I mean, that's what companies do.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   This is capitalism.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960]   Sure.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.960]   These companies do.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:58.560]   But I admit, I tried to use my Amazon Echo to play music through Google Play and it didn't
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.960]   work very well, but using Amazon Music worked fine.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.680]   Shopping.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.680]   Google.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.280]   I've been given what we just talked about how Google has just taken off.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.280]   I'm wondering, maybe it would be in Google's interest to say, "Well, because one of the
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.680]   things I like to do that Google doesn't do is listen to audiobooks for Monoble."
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.000]   If wouldn't it be great if Google could sum...
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.360]   Obviously, I'm not going to do a deal with Amazon because they don't like each other.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.680]   But maybe this is a way to solve this problem is just ask Google Assistant, "Could you contact
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:39.000]   Amazon to get my book and play it for me or something?"
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   I guess it's...
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.040]   They had a... in New York, John Borthwick's organization, had an event with voice companies,
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.400]   which I talked about on the show probably about nine to ten months ago.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.200]   There was disgust there.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.520]   You're going to have the cacophony of voices.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.760]   You basically just have to ask Meta and have it go and find the right thing in there.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.600]   There's work on that in essence.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.960]   Well, but that's the problem is that the opposite of what these companies want.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.280]   They want the social right.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.680]   They want lock in.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:15.240]   That's why it might be best to go to a Microsoft whose Cortana voice assistant is clearly way
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.360]   back and say, "Here's an opportunity that you could..."
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.040]   Yeah, I don't think Apple would do it.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.880]   It's just not an Apple's DNA.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.400]   It is interesting.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.480]   Amazon's Echo services are coming to PCs.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.280]   HP, Asus, and Acer are all going to...
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.400]   I think this is with Microsoft's cooperation.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.400]   Add Echo to the PCs.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:46.080]   Microsoft did do some sort of relationship between Cortana and Echo.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:50.440]   Maybe before you install an Echo, you should read this story.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:56.960]   Amazon coughs up record amount of info to subpoena happy US government.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.720]   Amazon received 2,000 requests for information from governments in the first six months of
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:08.360]   2017 and approved 904 almost half of them.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:15.240]   This is from their own transparency report they do twice a year.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:19.680]   1,936 of those requests came from the US.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.320]   75 from non-US.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.960]   Okay.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:28.360]   So Apple makes a big deal of because they don't rely on advertising.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.360]   No, we don't track you.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.560]   We don't know anything.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.440]   What does Siri know about you?
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.280]   What does Alexa know about you?
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.600]   The same things and don't you think Apple when approached...
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.600]   You can't fight these.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.600]   What are you going to do?
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.720]   No, you can't.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.440]   You can, but I mean...
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:49.880]   Don't Amazon and Apple both say they don't store your commands?
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.000]   No, Amazon absolutely stores your commands.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.360]   I know Google, Google, you can actually go to your dashboard and see them.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.360]   All of them?
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.040]   All of them.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.760]   Amazon, I'm pretty sure you can see some of them on the Amazon app.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.760]   I'm trying to remember.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.080]   I think you can listen back.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.880]   And I'm sure Siri does too because that's how they learn, right?
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.440]   I don't know.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.440]   This is a good question.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.000]   Chatham, can you work on this for us?
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.920]   Be my personal assistant.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:21.440]   What does Apple say about the stored audio from a Siri command?
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.440]   What happens to that?
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.960]   Wasn't there a case?
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:31.560]   Wasn't there a legal case where they were trying to get access to recordings of conversation?
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.880]   And Apple said, "We don't have it."
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.320]   Oh yeah, you're talking about the...
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.800]   That was Amazon.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.800]   So it started with the hot tub.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800]   The hot tub.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   What?
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.800]   It all started with the hot tub.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.080]   It always started with the word for hot tub.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.400]   It was the hot tub murder.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.200]   And the guy denied that he did it.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.200]   And so police subpoenaed Amazon in case.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.200]   I don't know.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.360]   But Echo, the murderer is...
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.360]   Or something.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.360]   I don't know.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.560]   No, they thought there'd be stray audio, perhaps.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.520]   Because you know, sometimes your Echo gets triggered.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.280]   And they said they only keep the commands.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.080]   No, Amazon fought it.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.200]   They didn't say we don't have it.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200]   They fought it.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.200]   Yeah, I think they said they...
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.640]   Then they gave up because the police gave up.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.640]   No, no, no.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.640]   I thought they said they don't keep the end up.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   They have the voices.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.920]   They have the actual voices, I think, because that was the point is who was there?
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.400]   I think they thought they did.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.960]   I think the police thought they did.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:32.960]   Well, but I think Fortune...
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.040]   I thought Amazon said they don't keep the ambient audio.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040]   Fortunately.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.240]   There is a way to look back.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.240]   Look at this here.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.240]   Amazon...
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.240]   It's only there was a global network here.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.240]   It's only there was...
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.440]   I mean, let's just point out, I'm miraculous this is.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.840]   There's no question that can't be answered with a Google search.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:55.400]   Amazon's pushing back against Arkansas prosecutors' demand for information from a murder suspect's smart
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.720]   speaker setting up another legal battle.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.920]   Oh, by the way, thanks to the internet.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.320]   We now have autoplay audio.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.320]   Autoplay video.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:08.600]   Boston County prosecuting attorney Nathan Smith hopes the voice activated echo which answers
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.600]   be blah blah blah.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.360]   We'll provide information about how man came to be found dead in 31 year old James Bates
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.000]   Hot Tub.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.160]   The defense attorney says there's nothing useful in the device.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.920]   It applauds Amazon for protecting privacy.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.920]   But I don't think Amazon, at least not in this article, said we don't have it.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.080]   They just said we don't want to give it to you.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.840]   That battle continued.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:35.600]   By the way, the prosecutor also subpoenaed the water records for the house.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:42.320]   And I think the guy got convicted because there was a big use of water like in the middle
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.160]   of the night.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.960]   And the presumption was he was using it to wash away the blood.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:53.400]   Anyway, I hope I'm not misstating that.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:56.840]   During the Amazon echo works by constantly listening for the wake word, then records
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.320]   your voice, transfers it to a processor for analysis.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:07.640]   The recordings are streamed and stored remotely and can be reviewed or deleted over time,
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.880]   presumably by the user.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.600]   So Amazon said that they do have those recordings.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.720]   So wait, they handed over the data.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:23.080]   No, they gave they they stopped the fight because the police stopped asking for it because
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.360]   they got the water records.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:30.600]   When was that when was that story from?
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.800]   This is from December 28, 2016.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.360]   Is this in March 2017?
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.400]   TechCrunch says Amazon handed over data from from the echo.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:47.560]   Oh, because the defendant agreed to allow police to review it.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.560]   Oh, that's right.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.000]   That's what I remember that now.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   Yes.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.320]   They checked OK's Amazon to hand over echo recording.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.720]   That's right.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.560]   That's they stopped.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:02.360]   They stopped because the guy said OK, so they handed over a record, but they refused
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.120]   to hand over the actual audio.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.560]   So like a transcript?
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.480]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.480]   Interesting.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:17.560]   Anyway, it just shows you though, between your water records, your echo.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.200]   There's a lot of data about what's going on.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.560]   What water records has nothing to do with the internet at all.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.880]   I'll just be clear about that because he had a smart water meter.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.600]   Not internet, but it was.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.800]   Yeah, the smart monitoring is his usage.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.960]   So I got into a Twitter tip this week with Tom Peters, the Peter principal.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   Oh, really?
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.920]   Because he went on about Facebook is the worst thing on earth and he compared it to
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.200]   the atom bomb.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.200]   Yes.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.200]   Come on.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.200]   Come on.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.040]   Well, I think the atom bomb has killed more people in Facebook.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040]   I think.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040]   And then he went off about how well, well, no, I don't fear the internet.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   I fear genetic manipulation.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   Is that Jesus?
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.040]   What is he?
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:07.200]   Well, was it was the Peter principle, the one where people rise to their level of incompetence?
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.200]   No comment.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.200]   It's kind of appropriate.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:18.200]   Oh, oh my God.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:23.400]   Number twenty seventeen, Arkansas judge drops murder charge and Amazon Echo case.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.600]   Oh, I'm just reading that.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.800]   The case was dismissed.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.080]   I can't stand in front of a jury and ask them to convict someone beyond a reasonable doubt.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.920]   So the prosecuting attorney, he filed the, he actually wasn't the judge.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.560]   It was the prosecutor who filed a motion.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.600]   If I be on a reasonable doubt, if I have a reasonable doubt.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.360]   So Bates says, I'm a hundred percent innocent.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.840]   The charges were dropped.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.840]   I did nothing wrong.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.840]   I'm not going to hide.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.280]   So my apologies to James Bates.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.040]   Innocent.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:01.640]   In that story, Amazon says that it listens for, so it's always listening, but it's listening
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.840]   for the wake word.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.840]   Right.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.840]   And only then does it.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.640]   So there's no, there's not a general, it's not like there's a bug in your house.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.640]   No, no, no.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   Right.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.160]   So if you're, that's true of your phone, that's true of all of these.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.160]   They don't, you would, they would use huge amounts of bandwidth if they're constantly
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.000]   streaming your, you couldn't store all that.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   You couldn't do it.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   You wouldn't want to do it.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.640]   And you can, with Google, you can look at exactly what it's kept like, what it heard.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   And you can change it.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.080]   No, but that's true of all of these.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.240]   And actually the, I think most people who are worried about the privacy concerns are merely
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:41.080]   saying yes, but with a, a FISA court order or a national security letter, the, the FBI
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   could turn on the microphone in your echo and stream everything without your knowledge.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.520]   That's what people are concerned about, not the, or that Amazon could be doing it, you
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.920]   know, selectively or whatever.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.800]   So there you go.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.000]   A tragic accident stemming from drinking.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.400]   And, and that's that.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.640]   Okay.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.840]   So I apologize.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.440]   Now that we've gone through all the, and that was just, that just happened a month ago.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.640]   So use an echo, but not a hot tub.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.120]   Well we know hot tubs are dangerous.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.520]   Hot tubs are like the atomic bomb.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.520]   No germs.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.520]   Worse germs.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.520]   Germs.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.520]   Germs.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.520]   Nuclear germs.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.520]   Germs.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:30.960]   You know, the state of California, I don't know how it is in Canada or New Jersey for that
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:36.400]   matter, but the state of California dictates that no hot tub can be hotter than a hundred
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   four degrees.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   What?
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.300]   And why?
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.000]   So you don't cook yourself.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   Carvoise.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.440]   But, but I happened to like a hundred five degrees.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.920]   So when we, when we got our hot tub installed, I asked the installer, can I hack this?
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.960]   He said, no, not with any, not with any ease.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.040]   It's built into the pit.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.040]   What?
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.480]   In the state.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.280]   And I bet because it's in the state of California, it's the same everywhere because if, you know,
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.920]   you want to sell hot tubs to every state.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.840]   It should be your right to cook yourself at whatever temperature you desire.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.400]   I could, well, and if I want my bathtub to be 120 degrees, I could do that.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.640]   There's no limit on the how hot my water here can get.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.280]   That's the freedom the founding fathers bought for.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.120]   And 104 degrees is tepid.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.120]   It's not.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.520]   No, it's not good enough.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.520]   Not good enough.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.520]   Not good enough.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.640]   I'm not as high as 106.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.320]   So I'm not a big, I, I'm not a big fan of the nanny state.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.800]   I think we should all have seat belts.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.360]   Hot tubs and spaws in the US.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.960]   Canada and most parts of the world have been regulated.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:40.960]   Canada too.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:41.960]   To vice versa.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960]   Hello, Canada.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.760]   Since when?
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:49.320]   Strokes could be caused by water temperatures of 106 or higher.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.560]   It's my right to have a stroke if I want.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560]   Right.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.560]   If I want to have a stroke, I should be allowed.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.120]   No, I don't want, I agree.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.600]   106 is a little hot, but 104 is a little cool.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.360]   I would like to see, I usually go 105, 106.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.360]   I do.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.200]   When I was a kid, that's how we set the hot tub.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.000]   On December 31st, 1970.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   Wait a while.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   79.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.680]   The Consumer Product Safety Commission issued advisory.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:22.840]   But it's not like I have friends and they put it 106 all the time.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.400]   Well, they must have a pre-1979 hot tub heater.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.520]   I don't think so.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.360]   They have a hot tub time machine.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.360]   Black market.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.800]   Got a black market.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.360]   I want a seriously long route to that.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.360]   I seriously wanted a hack.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.360]   I know.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:42.880]   I seriously want to hack my hot tub heater to go a little, just a little hotter.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.480]   It's just not hot enough.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.720]   How many people died in hot tubs?
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:48.720]   Really?
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.720]   Of the heat.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.720]   From the heat.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.720]   From other causes, maybe.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:53.880]   Okay, Google.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.760]   How many people have died from hot tubs?
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.720]   Didn't understand it.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:09.360]   It's always fun to ask Siri these things.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.000]   How many hot tub deaths were there in the last 20 years?
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.040]   Yeah, they're really thinking.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.040]   I can search the web for answers.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.040]   Oh, shut up.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.320]   That's okay, Google.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.800]   How many hot tub deaths were there in the last 20 years?
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.040]   I think the 20 years might be messing up.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:38.400]   The reason I used 20 years is because it's been 22 years that we have been using processors
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:44.480]   that could be easily hacked thanks to the meltdown and specter flaw.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:50.920]   Intel started using speculative execution in 1995.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.720]   This is still going on, by the way.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.000]   This whole issue.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:08.040]   I asked Paul Theradif, this was a Paul on CES because not just PCs, most modern processors
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:13.960]   sit for the simplest stuff like an Apple Watch or a Raspberry Pi are vulnerable and
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.040]   particularly shared processors.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:23.080]   He said it didn't seem to be slowing down the excitement over the processor controlled
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.080]   thermostat.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:29.280]   Did you see Scott Hanselman's discussion about explaining it?
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.800]   We talked a little bit about this yesterday in security.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.000]   I'd use it a couple of times.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.520]   Scott is a programmer at Microsoft.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.520]   He's smart.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.080]   Explaining meltdown in non-technical spouse.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.440]   So he's talking about, I guess, non-technical spouse.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.720]   You know how we finish each other's sandwiches?
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.720]   No.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:51.200]   This is but you guessed sandwiches and it was in your mind for an instant and it was a password
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.640]   and someone stole it while it was there fleeting.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.640]   Brilliant.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.640]   That is bad.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.720]   Brilliant and, by the way, exactly 280 characters.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.720]   And true.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.840]   Well, it's simplified, but yeah.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.840]   Very true.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.840]   Roughly true.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.840]   I don't know.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:14.120]   I don't really know how you explained to anybody except that there's a problem and this is
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.840]   going to be a hard problem to fix.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:24.280]   And now Intel and Microsoft are saying processors, the only processors won't be vastly slowed
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:28.520]   down by this are the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth generation Intel processors.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:34.480]   Haswell and earlier we can fix, but it will be really slow.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.960]   And I mean like really slow.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.600]   And that's bad news.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:45.880]   Epic Games published a graph which we showed yesterday on security now.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.000]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.400]   Oh, you're fast.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.400]   Look at that.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   That's from the Verge.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:58.280]   So this is the, what you're seeing, I'll explain it, is kind of the sine wave of usage.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.160]   You know, it peaks at, you know, seven p.m.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.080]   People get home to play this game called Fortnite.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.240]   This is their Fortnite servers.
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.600]   They applied the mitigation.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.000]   See that big spike?
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   Wow.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.760]   They applied the mitigation where that big spike is not the first one, but the second
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.960]   one.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:19.280]   And from then on processor usage was two and a half times higher.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.280]   Holy cow.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:23.280]   Didn't Google say that they are on their on their CPUs.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.160]   They've they've done something which had minor impact.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.000]   More modern processors apparently will have less of an impact.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.600]   It is important though you do this.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:39.480]   These shared servers have to do it because a rogue process could could see everything
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.840]   going on in the server.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.760]   So or a lot of what's going on in the server.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.240]   So that's a, yeah, that is bad.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.240]   That is bad.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:52.680]   There is the really the bad thing is the vast majority of Android phones will never be fixed
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.760]   even though they're vulnerable.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:55.760]   Right.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:56.760]   The vast majority.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.880]   The good news is it's not the easiest hack to implement.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.560]   And even if you do it, it's not one of those hacks that gives you like root access to the
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.680]   smartphone or a computer.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:11.840]   It's one of those hacks that some information is leaked and it could contain among a lot
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:15.120]   of other stuff passwords and credit cards or some other stuff.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.040]   But you you don't know what you're getting.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.440]   You're just getting a blob of data.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.360]   You'd have to comb through it, figure out what it is.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.400]   It's not the kind of attack I think that lends itself to a mass infection.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.960]   It's much more useful for a targeted attack.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:34.240]   If you were a bad guy or the NSA and you knew that Sony Pictures Entertainment was up to
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.040]   no good, you would send them spearfishing attacks and you'd kind of have some idea of
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.480]   what you're looking for in the data that you'd get back.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.040]   Anyway, it's going to be around forever.
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.560]   It's not, this is not going to go away.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.520]   Although it would be interesting because Paul Thorett speculated maybe this will be a big
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.800]   bump in new PC sales this year.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   God.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   "Warnedless phone laptop searches at the US border hit record levels."
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.640]   Do we cover this last week?
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.640]   Nope.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.200]   I don't think so.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.320]   Oh, Lord.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.720]   I was thinking that it had gone down.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:13.720]   It has not.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.200]   There was a story on the rundown last week.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.360]   We didn't talk about it, I think.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.880]   But yeah, it's scary.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:24.240]   Figures released on the first Friday of the month, which is what January 5th, reveal that
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:29.880]   customs and border protection officers searched 32,200 devices.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:35.520]   Weirdly enough, the majority of them people going out of the US, not into.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.520]   Weird.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.680]   That's really weird because you don't go through it, customs.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.680]   Why?
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.680]   When you leave the US.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.120]   Well, maybe I misunderstood.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:51.080]   It's a 60% increase over last year, 2,500 searches a month.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.680]   Remember, 400 million people across the border.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:23:01.440]   So it's a tiny fraction of total.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:11.160]   And of the searches, 32,000 searches, I think four out of five were US citizens.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.680]   Oh.
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:18.160]   So we've talked a little bit about this.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:27.720]   The ACLU says that there's a new policy, by the way, that this border patrol will only
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:34.880]   be able to access your phone and the contents of it, but they can't search cloud data or
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:38.520]   copy files without all reasonable cause.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.320]   Interesting.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.520]   That's a new policy.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:51.680]   However, my problem is if you lose control of your device, if they actually take your
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.160]   device and go in another room, you don't know what's been done to it.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.360]   Well, they didn't do it.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:01.840]   And so then that raises, it hasn't happened to me and you travel an awful lot, Jeff.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.840]   I presume it hasn't happened to you.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:05.840]   Not wouldn't know.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.120]   But then we're not brown.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.120]   Right.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.040]   But if it did, I think the prudence thing would be to throw away the phone in the floor right
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.640]   on that top, which I, maybe that's the prudence thing.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.640]   It doesn't seem like a very.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:18.640]   Is there anything they could do?
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:19.640]   Well, they do that.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.560]   Is there anything they could do that would affect your cloud stuff?
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:29.640]   Well, so I think it would be a violation of the policy, but they could just.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:34.840]   So the policy, well, first of all, it doesn't need a warrant.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.200]   It just needs probable cause.
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.760]   Right.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:45.520]   So only a court can decide then after the fact whether that was merited, right?
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.000]   They take it.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.160]   Now normally what they do is they attach the machine that just take all the data off of
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.160]   it.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.960]   That apparently requires probable cause now.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.520]   So I would imagine most likely to say, please unlock it, sir.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.160]   And you say no.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.440]   The ACLU says say no.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.480]   And then they'll say, well, okay, but you're going to have to stay here until you do.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:09.000]   And then you call the number that you have in your wallet for the ACLU lawyer who comes
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.440]   to spring you from airport jail.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.000]   That's how the ACLU says it should happen.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.480]   More likely what you'll do is say, Oh, look, I got to get home.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.000]   Just whatever.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   Unlock the phone.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000]   They take it and they, if they take it out of your presence, they could put a Trojan horse
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.160]   on it that would get everything forever.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.160]   That's the fear.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:32.160]   Well, what I'm asking is, so let's say you throw out that phone, but you remain on Google.
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:37.840]   Because they could one of the things they could have, well, you know, if they got your Google
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.480]   password, you screwed.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.240]   You should change all your passwords while you're at it.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.760]   I mean, they could get your one password, right?
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.360]   They could get your password.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.280]   One password is great because one password has a travel setting, which eliminates everything
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.400]   from your password vault until you get home and then you can re sync it.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.960]   But if they could get into your one password, that would be very bad.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:03.040]   I don't know.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.040]   So good news.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:10.080]   Senate Democrats have put together enough co-sponsors to force a vote.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:18.040]   30 votes necessary to force a vote on the net neutrality repeal at Marky Claire McCaskill.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.040]   There's a later number.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.240]   It's now up to 43, I think.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.800]   It needs needs to be 51, I think.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.960]   Well, yeah, but they pass the path.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.920]   They pass the number needed for at least they have to vote it on the floor.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:31.920]   It has to go.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:37.680]   Collins, and this doesn't make up for her last vote, is now in.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.680]   She's a Republican.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:39.680]   She's a Republican.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.680]   So I got that's a Republican.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.240]   Remember Doug Jones replaced Luther Strange.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.640]   So that's two.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.640]   So maybe it's completely, I mean, this is completely the right.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.040]   But that's just the Senate.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.040]   Right.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.680]   And you get in the house is impossible.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.680]   So never mind.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:03.920]   But it does, I mean, at least have the vote and protest against Ajit Pai.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:12.360]   Netflix, who was vacillating about net neutrality for a while, has said officially, "We will
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.120]   see you in court."
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.520]   They tweeted, "This is the new way of communicating with the world."
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:22.960]   In 2018, the Internet is united in defense of net neutrality for the FCC.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:23.960]   We will see you in court.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:29.600]   It makes it a lot easier to report these stories when there's under 140 characters.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.840]   You just read the tweet.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:32.360]   It took a while though, right?
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.440]   I mean, they even said initially, "Yeah, we don't have to worry about it.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.440]   We don't care about net neutrality."
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.440]   We don't care.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.720]   We don't worry about it.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:48.520]   Google shut down at CES booth because it's not waterproof.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.920]   There's apparently a lot of leakage.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:57.000]   The rain, they got more than an inch of rain in 24 hours.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.960]   That's half of the yearly rainfall.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.960]   That's it?
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:01.960]   Yeah, I know.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.960]   An inch.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.960]   An inch.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:04.960]   Big deal.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.160]   But you see all the tarps on the Google booth?
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.040]   So Google basically just didn't plan for the idea that it was Google.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.040]   Not Google.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.040]   No, not Google.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.800]   The ceiling of the convention center.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.320]   I thought this was an outdoor booth.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320]   Oh, it was.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.320]   It was two-level outdoor booths.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.320]   You're right.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.320]   That's a rough booth.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.120]   Not meant to withstand rain.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.120]   Wow.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.680]   Oh, all those devices getting wet.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.600]   All those guys in white suits have been mopping up.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.760]   What I didn't know is that's the first time Google's had an exhibit at CES.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:37.760]   Really?
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.760]   Wow.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.600]   This is one of the things that if you...
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.440]   I remember Microsoft doing this one year.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.920]   They built a house in the parking lot.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:45.920]   It was like the Wizard of Oz.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.120]   It just dropped a house in the parking lot.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.360]   It was to show off tablets.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360]   This is way back when the...
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.360]   Microsoft was...
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.520]   Bill Gates loved tablets in the early 2000s.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.520]   This might have been context.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.360]   I don't even remember what show it was, but it was in the parking lot.
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:06.320]   You go in the house and there was a room in each house and there was a person in the
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.200]   room that represented the room like, of course, the wife was in the kitchen, the husband was
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:19.760]   sitting in front of the TV, junior was upstairs and they all had a Microsoft tablet.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.760]   So Google did the same thing.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:31.480]   They built a structure in the house with, among other things, a slide.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:36.160]   A huge video wall and now it's wet.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:41.520]   Oh, geez.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.320]   Here's the slide, by the way.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.360]   Oh, Google.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:51.040]   Yeah, this is...
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.040]   But they were really...
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.160]   This was all about Google Assistant.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:30:00.520]   They were very much there for Google Assistant.
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.880]   Anything else you guys want to talk about?
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:02.880]   We can...
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:03.880]   Oh, let's see here.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:04.880]   Did you hear all the rad?
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:05.880]   I don't know what you're about to do that.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.880]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.360]   HTC shows a new pro version of its Vive.
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.920]   Lots more resolution.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:17.840]   So it can make you even sick.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:21.120]   The first standalone Daydream headset.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.120]   This is...
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:23.120]   You know, Daydream...
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.120]   The Google...
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.960]   Daydream requires a smartphone, but Lenovo and Google are making one that has its own
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:34.880]   computer built in and they have announced new VR180 consumer cameras, 180 degree consumer
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:35.880]   cameras.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.800]   I don't know if that's related.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.960]   Lenovo and E technology, E makes the cameras, I'm sure.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:44.880]   I have a E action cam.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.440]   Oh, I get it.
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.760]   VOR180 is what is the name of this.
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:52.640]   The content is VR180.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:59.120]   So the headset which is made by Lenovo is called the Mirage Solo with Daydream.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:04.960]   It uses Google's world sense motion tracking technology to sense when a user is doing things
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.840]   like crouching, dodging, leaning.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.840]   Normally these...
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.400]   Like the Vive and the Oculus, they have cameras.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.240]   Sensors, they know when you move.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:15.000]   It's a Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAMS.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.760]   It's kind of like a smartphone in there.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:22.640]   Seven hours on a charge according to Lenovo.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:23.640]   I think...
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:24.640]   Paul Thorett was talking about it.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.440]   I think he tried it and said he liked it.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.480]   But maybe he was excited about it.
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.480]   So now you...
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.480]   I don't...
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   You know, I have a Daydream.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.480]   I don't think I've ever used it.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.480]   Ever.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.480]   Who's that?
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:38.480]   Oh, who's that?
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:41.480]   Oh my God.
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:44.720]   Stacey Higginbotham as I live and breathe.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.720]   Hello from CES.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:46.720]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:47.880]   We're rather from Michael Hotel Room.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:48.880]   Oh, thank you.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:49.880]   We asked...
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.560]   I asked Carsey to see if we could get you to join us.
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.640]   How nice to see you.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.640]   Nice Stacey.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:55.640]   Stacey.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:56.640]   Stacey.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:00.480]   So this was an IOT CES, right?
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.480]   It is.
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:02.480]   That was the big theme of the show.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:06.160]   If I'm pushing anything, it's all IOT all the time.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.160]   Like a Michael...
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.640]   Mike Multikooker with the assistant built in.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:12.000]   Okay, let's not focus on the assistant.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.040]   The big focus, everyone's like, "Oh, voice is everywhere."
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:20.680]   What's really awesome about it is the fact that voice is everywhere means we finally
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:23.200]   stop talking about standards.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.120]   We're never going to get there on standards, but we found a way around it.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.520]   You mean like Zigbee Z-Wave and all that?
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.120]   All of that, yes.
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:34.880]   In even things like device schemas, which super nerdy, but like saying things like, "I'm
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:35.880]   a light bulb.
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.200]   I can do the following things."
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.960]   Like my hope was there would be like a universal protocol that does all that.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.680]   We never got there, but now because the Amazon Echo and Google Assistant and all are trying,
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:49.240]   they're building that for us.
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.240]   So it's not ideal.
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:53.240]   I would rather have it be more open, but that's where we are.
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.240]   Hey, cool.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.240]   Did you tell...
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:59.360]   Tell us about some of the devices or things you saw that you thought were interesting.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.360]   Okay.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:04.960]   So you guys are going to be so mad at me, but I haven't had much of a chance to walk
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.960]   the show floor.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.720]   I've got a couple things that are...
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.000]   Are you been doing meetings the whole time?
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.560]   I've been doing a lot of meetings.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.440]   Kevin is the guy walking the floor.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.440]   Okay.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:15.680]   But I do have some cool stuff.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:18.840]   I would never call Kevin a floor walker, but okay.
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:21.320]   Oh, that's what he excels at that.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:24.160]   He walks through and he's just like talking to a floor runner.
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.160]   He's a floor runner.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.160]   Exactly.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:27.160]   Well, that's true.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:29.160]   Kevin Tofel?
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.160]   Matthew.
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.160]   Kevin Tofel.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:37.440]   It's my partner.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:40.320]   I know.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.320]   It's awesome.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.320]   No, it's fun.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.320]   So the floor is thing.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.320]   Okay.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320]   I'm trying to decide.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.320]   Okay.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.320]   One for normal people.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:54.880]   I love the fact that both Kohler and Delta are doing faucets with not just Amazon Echo enabled,
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.560]   but are doing it to add additional values.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:02.480]   So you can tell your faucet dispense a cup of water and it will do it.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.280]   Exactly a cup.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.280]   Exactly a cup.
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.160]   Or you can even train it like my spaghetti pot.
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:10.920]   I can train it like fill the spaghetti pot and that means fill this much water.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.920]   That's cool.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:12.920]   And then later on I can do it.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:13.920]   So I love that.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.480]   I also saw some cool.
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:22.920]   This is super geeky, but Bosch was showing off a MEMS projector that basically is this
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:26.240]   tiny 30 by 70 millimeter module.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:33.760]   And what it can do is it can project a display at 480 to 720p.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:38.160]   It can even run video and you can actually interact with that display on any surface,
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.960]   including your skin.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:46.120]   So your couch, your skin, your kitchen table, like an Amazon Echo like device could project
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.480]   it, an image of the people walking up to your door or you know.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.520]   So you don't need a screen.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.320]   It almost could just appear.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.320]   Yes.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.320]   That's exactly it.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.320]   I like that.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.640]   It's awesome.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:02.200]   Is that available this year or is it a concept or?
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.360]   No, it's an actual working, it's a MEMS product.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.720]   So that's a semiconductor product.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.000]   So people will have to build that into their devices.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.440]   So you won't see that for another, I don't know, 18 months to two years.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.440]   Who knows?
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.040]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:17.600]   Low power.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.480]   It's relatively low power.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.880]   What's unique, the most unique thing about it is its form factor is now small enough.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.800]   And it can project on any surface without messing messing things up.
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.280]   Oh, look, you found it.
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:32.920]   Look at you finding these things.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.920]   That's cars.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920]   Good.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.920]   He's the best.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:36.920]   It can do video.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:37.920]   It can show video.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:46.440]   Actually, I don't think this is actually, that's the accelerometer.
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.440]   But that's okay.
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.440]   I did learn about the accelerometer.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.640]   I can tell you why that's cool if you really want to know.
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.520]   They use MEMS for that as well.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.680]   Yeah, MEMS are, I always explain MEMS to people like MEMS are the hidden heroes of the Internet
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.680]   of Things.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:04.560]   Because MEMS are these tiny things that take the analog real world signals of every day
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:09.080]   and they convert it to digital for the computer streets.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:14.680]   So you've got the real world meets the computer in this one tiny little device.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:17.080]   This projector uses lasers too.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.080]   It does.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.080]   Which is cool.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.080]   Lasers.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.080]   Lasers.
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:22.080]   Lasers.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:27.720]   We were talking about this Bosch bathroom because they've got a toilet, they've got a shower,
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.640]   they've got a tub, they've got a faucet.
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:33.280]   I do like the idea of, you came up with it.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:37.880]   I mentioned, well, the idea is you tell it what temperature you like the shower to be
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:42.720]   and have it warmed up and ready for you and that kind of stuff.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:46.880]   Now you know that the Central Hall has had a complete blackout for about an hour and a
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.880]   half.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:48.880]   It's just now coming back.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.280]   Kevin told me that.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.440]   He's like, I had to move.
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.080]   What would happen to your fancy bathroom if you couldn't use it?
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.080]   It's a powerful sound.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.640]   Alright guys, here's what happens.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.640]   It reverts back to state.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.640]   So I have a faucet.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:04.640]   Okay.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.640]   So it has a faucet.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:06.640]   It has a faucet.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.360]   Yeah, I have a faucet that's a capacitive touch faucet.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.840]   And when the power goes out, then I use the hands.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.720]   You just have to live like a...
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.240]   Yeah, it's like a savage.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.720]   Like a savage.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:22.200]   We actually can't use anything.
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.520]   Now we can't because we have a generator, but we have well water.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:28.040]   So if we lose power, we lose a lot.
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.040]   We lose a water too.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.040]   Right.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.040]   Yeah, that's bad.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.680]   So it's like when an escalator breaks, it just becomes stairs.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.680]   Exactly.
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:37.680]   What else?
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:38.680]   What else?
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:39.680]   What else?
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.080]   Come on, you're our eyes and ears in Vegas.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.080]   Okay.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:44.080]   More cool stuff.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.080]   More cool stuff.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.080]   You put...
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.400]   Okay, how long have you been there?
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.400]   When did you get there?
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.400]   Monday.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.400]   Okay.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:51.400]   Okay.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:57.720]   Go to our Instagram and I'm not doing that to advertise, but I'm doing it to offer like
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:01.720]   it's Stacy on I, it's Instagram, whatever slash Stacy and IOT.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:07.120]   Because then you'll see everything that Kevin and I have seen basically.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.120]   Okay.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:13.560]   So you saw these little Sony smart speakers with Google Assistant.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.560]   Nice.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.960]   Those are not exciting.
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.960]   Not exciting.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.040]   Here's the Samsung smart thing refrigerator.
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:25.840]   So that's a really big deal in like Samsung three years ago.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:28.520]   Samsung was like, IOT is going to happen.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:29.520]   It's going to be open.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.920]   It's going to be awesome.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:35.200]   And it was very kumbaya and Kevin and I made total fun of it along with the rest of the
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:36.440]   industry.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:41.960]   This year, they actually are making that happen and they're doing it at a higher level.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:46.760]   So three years ago, they talked all about like, Tizen and stuff like that.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.240]   Normal people were probably like, yeah.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.280]   Now they're basically, they've integrated all of their like 60 some odd apps into the
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.520]   smart things cloud.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.960]   They built all of their back and cloud stuff is now smart things.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:03.280]   And this is the TV showing this.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.280]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.960]   So your TV is going to be able to control all these crazy devices and it's going to have
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.720]   the same interface across all Samsung products.
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:13.440]   So it's a big freaking deal and it doesn't have to be just Samsung.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.480]   I see we have an Arlo camera on here.
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.000]   We have an air, fire, lights.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.080]   They have so many devices are already in a great.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:27.960]   Kevin and believe it or not, this looks like a selfie, but no, he's looking in the mirror.
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.920]   This is a smart mirror.
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.160]   Oh, see, it's got the temperature.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.840]   Oh, I want to know the music.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:36.840]   So you're in the bathroom.
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.320]   You're looking at the mirror.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.320]   Nice.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.520]   So you're connected to a scale and a skin sensor.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.000]   So you can see that's from higher.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.560]   That's kind of cool.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.160]   I'm getting a smart mirror ship to me.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.200]   I think next week, so I'll bring it on the show either next week or the week after.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.640]   I love this.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.640]   I would get a smart mirror.
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:55.640]   I want to build one.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.320]   How do you do it?
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.560]   Is it like something behind the mirror that shines through?
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.560]   I guess it is.
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.560]   Oh, the screen on the mirror?
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.560]   Yes.
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.560]   I don't.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:11.120]   Even in a hotel once it had a mirror, but when you turn on the TV, it was shined through
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:12.120]   the mirror.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.080]   This is like one way mirror or something.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.120]   There was a Google engineer who built one with a Raspberry.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.320]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.320]   Yeah, we talked about it.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.320]   Yeah, right.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.320]   Higher.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.320]   I'm sorry, Huawei.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.320]   You can't use these because they're from China.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.320]   Has a bunch of sensors, cameras, motion detectors.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:35.400]   I'm just going through TDK sensors.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:36.800]   There's tons of sensors.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.640]   Everybody has a smart home section.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.680]   I mean, I don't know what else to say about that.
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:47.480]   Lenovo, I'm sure we'll get there eventually, but Lenovo has a very nice Google Assistant,
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.640]   the Echo Show for the Google Assistant.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.680]   We talked about that and I'm excited to say it won't be out till the summer.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.680]   It's beautiful.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.680]   It sounds good.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:55.680]   It's affordable.
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:56.680]   Oh, you heard it.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.680]   Yeah, it's got a 10 watt speaker in it.
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:40:59.680]   Nice.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.400]   Yeah, the big ones, $249, the small ones, $199, I think.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.120]   That's a very competitive price.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.040]   It's basically an Echo Show, which is a seven inch screen.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.040]   Mm hmm.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.040]   I like that.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.680]   It looks good.
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:17.040]   I think in Google, I do believe Google will probably win this race if you start thinking
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:18.040]   about what needs to happen.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.680]   They're starting to pull ahead.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.880]   You hear you are at the WeMo booth and of course, WeMo announced a home kit compatibility
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:29.400]   across the board, which is a big deal because Apple HomeKit has been very slow off the block.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:32.360]   But I notice a big hey Google sign in the back there.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:35.000]   So obviously they also work with Google.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.760]   Yeah, and I'm kind of down on HomeKit.
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:41.080]   There's a lot of HomeKit compatible stuff as usual.
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:45.800]   Apple is not here, but I just found out that earlier this summer, I'm trying to get rid
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:52.160]   of that blue line there, earlier this summer, Lenar had partnered with Apple for HomeKit
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:56.160]   enabled buildings like smart new builds for homes.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:59.960]   And they actually switched over to smart things now.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:03.200]   So I was like, oh, that's no good.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.560]   You saw the Gebo there.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.840]   Now I have to say my Gebo failed.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:11.440]   And it's I have a dead Gebo, which is really the real thing.
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.640]   But I wasn't too unhappy because I'm sure there's a way to turn this off, but I couldn't
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   find it.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:17.640]   Gebo snored.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.640]   I'm not kidding.
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:19.640]   It would just.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.640]   I bet it was a totally a cute thing.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:28.440]   It was the first time.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:33.360]   It didn't sound like it would just like make little sounds every once in a while, which
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360]   was disconcerted.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.360]   That's to comfort you.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.360]   That's to comfort you.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.520]   It didn't comfort me.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:40.160]   It was creepy.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:42.960]   So I was kind of glad when it died.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.560]   I have to I have to contact the Gebo folks.
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:48.360]   And I don't know if I want a replacement or I might want my money back on it.
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.640]   How much was the Gebo 500 bucks?
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:53.680]   Oh, that was a special Indiegogo price.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.400]   I think it's more than that now.
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:58.040]   There are kind of robots here.
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:42:59.040]   Are there?
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:02.640]   Did you see the curry that we was our advertiser?
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.640]   Are they there?
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.640]   I didn't see the curry.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.080]   I saw I want to say it was the Aurelius maybe a you.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:13.080]   I was supposed to be out by now and I'm worried that they are out.
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:14.800]   It's hard to build a good robot.
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:15.800]   It's hard.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.760]   Stacy, did you see the Chloe video?
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:19.760]   LG?
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.640]   That didn't work.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.560]   LG was trying to show their.
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:24.560]   Yes.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:25.560]   Yes, I saw that.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.720]   I saw that after the fact.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.200]   The guy couldn't get it to respond at all.
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.960]   So I was very interested.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.360]   I don't know if you saw this.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:39.240]   Johnson Controls has a beautiful thermostat that's a glass.
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.160]   The $319 Cortana thermostat.
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:44.000]   Yeah, GLAS.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000]   I loved it.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.560]   Did you see it?
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.560]   I've seen it.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:48.560]   It's pretty.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.240]   Go look for it because it's there.
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:51.240]   Gorgeous.
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:52.240]   No, no, it is gorgeous.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:58.200]   I'm hoping that technology comes down in price because that really that changed the game in
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.840]   the way NEST didn't quite and making a thermostat look like a luxury object.
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:03.840]   Yes.
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:04.840]   Here's the solace.
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:10.080]   My home solace 250 Google Assistant or Echo enabled.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.320]   This controls everything.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.320]   These are everywhere.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.320]   Everything.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.120]   This is a very common category.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.160]   Panels of stuff with little tiles on them that control all your devices and have a bajillion
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.160]   radios.
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:24.160]   Yes.
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.160]   The FIBARO, I like the name smart plug monitors anything.
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.920]   Yeah, with the USB charger and that I like that because I was going to have to rip out
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.080]   all of my outlets and put USB chargers and I could just plug those in.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.840]   It's like a smart plug in from FIBARO.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:40.960]   The Blink doorbell.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:41.960]   Mm-hmm.
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.880]   Battery powered front door.
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:46.720]   So it competes with our sponsor ring.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:47.720]   Looks similar.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   It does.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.720]   Amazon bot ring.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.840]   Amazon, sorry, Amazon bot Blink.
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:55.320]   Oh, so this is Amazon's company now.
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.720]   Now this is like, I think it was, was it Christmas?
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:01.320]   Like the 23rd or something is when it came.
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:03.120]   You're right.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.880]   And they don't charge a monthly fee for this storage.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:06.880]   It's not.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:07.880]   It's a storage fee.
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:08.880]   That's a big problem.
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:12.520]   I think with a lot of these devices is that they all add up.
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:13.520]   Yes.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:15.080]   It's the storage fees.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.080]   You get pretty soon.
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:17.080]   It's true.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:21.560]   Here's the Netatmo smart home bot.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.560]   It's like Lighthouse.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:23.560]   Okay.
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:27.360]   But without the video, it's talked to it like a human being and then it does it.
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:28.360]   Could you switch the lights on?
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:30.360]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.360]   I'm just going through.
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:33.440]   Oh, the spire.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.440]   I had a spire.
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:36.400]   I did too.
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.600]   And I was kind of like, eh, on this, but it's actually.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.560]   It's supposed to make a breeze.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.640]   The new one is an activity tracker.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.640]   Mm-hmm.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.640]   So activity, respiration, heart rate.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.640]   Wow.
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.800]   I feel like something else.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.440]   And the coolest thing about this is you buy them in a pack of like eight or ten.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.440]   Oh, this is a good idea.
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.440]   Stick them in your underwear.
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:56.440]   And they're washable.
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:57.440]   That's a good idea.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:59.360]   Because that's the problem with all of these things.
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.360]   They're easy to lose.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:01.800]   If you wash them, they break some.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.760]   The one on the right is the original spire.
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:06.000]   So they've replaced it basically with a.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.200]   Wait, I think this is an additional because the original spire didn't have all those features.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.200]   Right.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:12.200]   Right.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:13.200]   Right.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.720]   Did you say, did you say stick it in your underwear?
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.440]   Yes, she did.
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:18.680]   That is where you're supposed to stick it.
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:21.560]   Did that excite you, Matthew?
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:22.560]   Not exactly.
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:23.560]   No.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:27.560]   Wait for your tape, my age.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:33.600]   No, when you get to your age, the underwear sticks you.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.120]   This is the Kevin, which is named after your co-host.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.400]   Indeed.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:42.720]   What does the Kevin do?
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:43.720]   I don't know.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:49.680]   Because when you leave home, it automatically makes sound and eliminates randomly.
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:52.800]   Oh, it makes people think you're home.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:53.800]   Right.
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:54.800]   OK.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.080]   I have an app that does that on my wink.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.080]   Who's home?
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:46:59.080]   Kevin Phillips, you.
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.080]   We left Kevin to take care of the house.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:02.080]   That's what they call it.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.080]   So it simulates arguments.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:06.880]   I told you to take out the trash.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:11.040]   It plays the one from last night.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:14.520]   As you point out, as we've talked about, Google is everywhere.
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.920]   Google Assistant is-- what is this?
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:18.320]   A gumball machine that you say, "Hey, Google, too."
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.320]   What is this?
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:20.320]   So this is in the stands.
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.320]   It's a gumball machine.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.800]   You tell it, "Hey, Google, do this," and it does it.
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:26.600]   And it's just-- it's eye candy.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:32.800]   And then over at the Las Vegas Convention Center, they have a slide in a big-- not a
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:33.800]   booth, whatever those--
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:34.800]   Yes.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.800]   But they had a closet because the rain--
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:36.800]   They had a closet.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.800]   Yes.
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.360]   So it's a water slide.
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:43.480]   And there are the people in the Google outfits that we were mocking with the little "Where's
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:46.720]   Waldo" hats and the white jumpsuit.
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:47.720]   They're everywhere.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:48.720]   Good lord.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:49.720]   Oh, it's kind of-- I guess you--
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.720]   Yep.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:51.720]   That's creepy.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:58.960]   It's-- that-- what would be creepy is if they had random facts memorized and when you
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.840]   said, "Hey, Google, tell me this."
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.880]   If they were human Google Assistant, that would be funny.
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.280]   That would be awesome.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.720]   Actually, Google totally could have done that.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:10.880]   It could have been an assistant using their voice kit thing.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:11.880]   And then when you talk to it--
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:12.880]   Oh, you put it in there here.
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:13.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:15.880]   I'm thinking.
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:19.280]   Could you actually get gumballs, though?
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:23.360]   I don't know if you could-- I did not stop to try to get a giant bowling ball-sized gumball.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:26.800]   Here's that Lenovo Google Assistant speaker we were talking about.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:27.800]   This is cool.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:30.000]   This view is good because it shows you how it stands up.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.560]   It's kind of curved back.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.720]   And it's bamboo and it's so pretty.
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:35.440]   That's kind of cool.
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:39.200]   You know, people hated how the Echo Show looked.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.360]   And there's a million of those.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.880]   Oh, the other thing on this is it has a camera cover.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:43.880]   I think that's really important.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:44.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:47.640]   And I found it interesting coming from Google, which is not--
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:51.840]   Yeah, I generally make fun of camera covers, you know, because apparently-- but in that
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.640]   case, I absolutely agree.
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:59.120]   Well, you know that Echo spot that I showed before I left the alarm clock with the camera
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.120]   on it?
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.040]   When I got home, it was face down.
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:03.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:08.800]   And so I moved it out of the bedroom because it probably shouldn't have a camera in the
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.800]   bedroom.
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:10.800]   It's in my closet, though.
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.960]   There's not much to see in there.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:15.160]   It's usually dark.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:20.480]   Here's another Google Assistant speaker from JBL, 8-inch link view, nice screen, high-res
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.520]   audio and video.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.360]   Video calling as well.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:26.840]   Does it use Duo when they do these--
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:27.840]   It does.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:28.840]   OK.
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.480]   So you can call any phone there.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.240]   Oh, now Duo makes a little bit more sense.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.520]   Because it's the phone-- well, who is going to use it, right?
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.640]   But now it makes sense because if people have a Duo speaker, they could call you on the
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:44.640]   phone.
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:50.200]   Wasn't there a report that Facebook was going to make a video screen calling to us?
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.200]   Yes.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.240]   Here's that-- oh, this is a Delta faucet.
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.960]   You have capacitive touch on your faucet.
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:49:59.960]   So this is--
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:04.560]   And this one has Wi-Fi and talks to the Echo and dispenses and does all the magic stuff.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.560]   OK.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.560]   All right.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.560]   Obviously--
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:11.760]   I'm trying to convince the guys at the booth to retrofit my faucet with the Wi-Fi module.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:18.040]   And finally, a very cute picture of the two of you.
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:22.600]   The TOEFL and the HIGGIN BOTHAM, the IoT podcast team in action.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:23.600]   The HIGGIN TOEFL.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.600]   The HIGGIN TOEFL.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:28.200]   Or the TOEFL BOTHAM.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:30.200]   I--
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:32.760]   HIGGIN TOEFL is better.
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:33.760]   I like HIGGIN TOEFL.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:35.760]   I'll see if Kevin goes for that.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:36.760]   Stay safe, so--
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:37.760]   You can do good.
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:38.760]   I'm so glad you could stop by.
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:39.760]   I really appreciate it.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.760]   And now you surprise.
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760]   Yeah, it was a great surprise.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:44.760]   It's no nice to see you.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.960]   And thank you for taking time out.
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:47.600]   I know you're probably crazy.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.640]   Well, I'm crazy all the time.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:52.480]   It's crazy busy, I mean.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:55.920]   So I'm glad-- yeah, because we missed you last week, so I'm glad to have you.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:56.920]   You want to stick around?
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:57.920]   You don't have to.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:02.260]   a fire, where you I would leave. We're about he was about to go to the debate, so wrap
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:04.420]   it up. It was perfect time. It was perfect.
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:06.780]   Fabulous. I miss you all the time, Stacey.
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:09.980]   Yeah. About five minutes, you might've been calling it
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:12.760]   and nothing. Yeah, no, no, no. Cars don't well.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.980]   Carsten wouldn't let me do that. Carsten new. Okay. Well, I am going to run
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:19.680]   because I want to hit the show floor before we have something. Have fun.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:28.060]   But thank you guys. I'll see you next week. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye from C. Yes.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:36.100]   Stacey Higginbotham, Stacey Higginbotham, and of the IoT podcast. Our show today brought
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:41.560]   to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans, Quicken Loans. I was reading the story of
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:44.380]   Quicken Loans the other day because I was curious, well, is there a relationship to
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:50.140]   Intuit? And there was for three years, very briefly. Dan Gilbert created
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:55.460]   Quick and Loans as I think was called Rocket Mortgage. Now the name Rocket Mortgage kind
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:52:01.640]   of makes sense and sold it in '99 to Quicken. But he didn't like what Quicken was doing
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:05.760]   with it or whatever. So three years later, he bought it back.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:11.740]   He bought it back and but kept the name Quicken Loans. But Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:15.100]   now kind of makes more sense to me because it was rock investments or something like
[01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:21.380]   that. In the intervening years, they've become the number one mortgage lender in the country.
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:28.220]   Number two in pure size, $92 billion in loans last year. But number one in your hearts for
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:34.060]   eight years running 2010 through 2017, number one in customer satisfaction, according to
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:41.140]   JD Power. And that's in mortgage origination. And then from 2014 to 2017 in mortgage servicing.
[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:45.220]   And they just got it again for 2017. I'm sure they'll get in 2018 and on and on because
[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:50.060]   they really are customer centric. They want to create a mortgage approval process that's
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:57.500]   simple, transparent, modern. And they've done it with Rocket Mortgage. It's a client focused
[01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:02.260]   technological revolution. No more going to the bank, no more going through your bankers,
[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:07.460]   boxes or your basement or attic to look for paperwork. You could do it all on your phone,
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:12.980]   your computer, your tablet. And you could do it like in real time because all they need
[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:16.900]   is you and answer a few questions to identify yourself. And then they go out, they get because
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:20.260]   they have trusted partners with all the financial institutions. So it makes it easy for you to
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:23.980]   share your information with them at the touch of a button. You don't have to go through
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:28.620]   those boxes and look for stuff. They get what they need. They run the numbers and based
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:33.420]   on your income, your assets and your credit, literally in a minute, they come back and say
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:37.540]   these are the home loan options for which you qualify. Down payment is yours to choose,
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:43.820]   same with the term and the rate. You pick the loan that's right for you and bada boom,
[01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:49.100]   you got it, you got it in minutes, you could do it at an open house. It's that fast. Rocket
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:54.900]   Mortgage. That's the other reason they call it rocket because fast and it lifts the burden
[01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:59.020]   of getting a home loan. Rocket mortgage from quick and loans apply. Simply understand fully

[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:59.980]   It's really not Google stuff, but I thought it was really kind of interesting. You read
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:03.220]   the story of Sarah Silverman's response to this. That's the one thing I wanted to talk
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:09.500]   about. I think it said me too. Why don't you tell the story first? Silverman sent out a
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:14.020]   tweet and a guy, you know, unknown to her as often happens on Twitter responded with
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:21.660]   the C word was just nasty one word. But her response was very interesting. She said,
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:27.420]   I believe in you. I read your timeline and I see what you're doing and your rage is
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:31.740]   thinly veiled pain. But you know what? I know this feeling.
[01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:41.540]   PS, my back sucks too. I'm cutting some of the bad words. Apparently when she read his
[01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:46.500]   timeline, she realized he had a bad back. PS, my back sucks too. See what happens when
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:53.540]   you choose love. I see it in you. The troll responded, I can't choose love. A man that
[01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:57.740]   resembles Kevin Space, he took that away when I was eight. I can't find peace. If I could
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:01.700]   find that guy who ripped my body or stripped my innocence, I'd kill him. He messed me up
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:07.980]   and I'm poor, so it's hard to get help. So she had read in his profile that he was an
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:12.180]   addict. She said, you use heroin? Do you want to get clean? He said, no, no. I smoke weed
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:18.860]   and I take prescription drugs. She says, good, well, I want to kill him too. So I can't imagine
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:25.100]   your rage. All I know is this rage. And even if you could kill him, it's punishing you
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:28.340]   and you don't deserve punishment. You deserve support. Go to one of these support groups
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:31.700]   who might meet your best bros there. This is, I should say, Sarah Silverman is a very
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:37.540]   well-known comic, great, talented comic and a very interesting response to being really
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:43.620]   amazing. She ended up helping, getting him help back. He said, I'll go. You know, and
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:48.460]   she said, keep me posted. She then said, Hey, San Antonio, because that's where he's from.
[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:52.060]   Are there any kick ass back or neck care specialist willing to help my friend Jeremy?
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:56.300]   He's several slip discs, no insurance. Can't work because of severe pain. Let's get him
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:01.140]   back on his feet. Lots of response. A spinal clinic in San Antonio reached out, offered
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:08.420]   help. Air roasty, A-I-R-R-O-S-T-I. And just to let you know, we've been in contact with
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:14.140]   Jeremy. We're on it. They said this was on New Year's Eve. Just amazing.
[01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:22.540]   It really shows something that you hope for more of. It's a moment of empathy. It's hard.
[01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:26.620]   I mentioned this to a woman I work with and she said, Oh, great. So all women have to
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:35.580]   be moms to trolls. I said, fair point, absolutely. But as a model of how to rethink the behavior
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:42.060]   we have socially on the net, Sarah Sullivan, bless you. That's a major step for civility.
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:46.420]   Yeah. And either way, don't expect her to do it again necessarily or others to do it.
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:48.220]   No, no. But it's just an amazing moment.
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:56.180]   Yeah. I wish more people on Twitter particularly would try and take a minute to think about
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:58:01.940]   the person behind the tweet. I know it's hard sometimes. But sometimes there is a human being
[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:09.940]   that is, that is, that you can reach out to. Not always, obviously, but sometimes.
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:13.100]   Yeah, really. Thanks for including that one.
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:22.100]   Yeah. Just to kind of, and it wasn't just a drive by either as Bill Murphy's pointing
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:27.300]   out in Enki. It was, she took the time to find out about the guy. She got involved. She did
[01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:34.300]   something about it. It wasn't just like, I feel your pain, man. It was really, yeah,
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:35.860]   it's a good for everybody.
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:41.100]   All right. From one heartwarming moment to the next. Yeah. You probably all saw that
[01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:48.620]   amazing video of the dog pulling the sled up the hill and then writing down. Yeah. The
[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:52.900]   video was taken out and put in news stories all over. But if you go to the woman's young
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:58.140]   woman's Instagram feed, this is the most amazing dog on Earth. So, so we knew you might want
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:03.240]   to show the dog video again. Sure. The original dog video is there. It's there. It's there.
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:08.100]   It's 50. Yeah. Here it is. Because I mean, I'm faking a number here. She says the dog
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:11.560]   must have gone up. No, no, no, no, no. Go to that one. Nope. Nope. Nope. We don't want
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:15.540]   to buy it. Go to the one I'm on the run down. The today show daily click. You didn't want
[01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:21.740]   to do that one. How was that? Go to the water. Okay. It's in the rundown. But where in the
[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:26.260]   right now in my number? It's my number. Oh, Instagram. Should I start with the Instagram?
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:31.020]   Start with that one. Okay. People who haven't seen it. So here's the amazing wonderful dog
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:36.660]   pulls the little sled up the it's one of those plastic.
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:41.660]   Incidentally, that dog is almost identical to the one I'm dog sitting right now. Really.
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:46.900]   Oh, so looks like a border collie, maybe or border. Australian. They're the smartest
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:50.860]   or Australian shepherd. They're the smartest dogs. Look at that. That is pretty cool. Is
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:54.220]   he going to? Is he going to? Is he smart enough to get it and go back? Oh, yes. Wait.
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:59.220]   Yep. So she says the dog did like 50 times that day. I think the cutest thing I ever
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:03.900]   saw. Isn't that great one now? Well, this is the service. A lot of people saw this video
[02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:11.500]   videos, make the person click on her account. My Aussie gal on Instagram. 17 years old. The
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:16.940]   relationship with this dog is incredible. And just go to some of the videos here. So there's
[02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:21.140]   a quiz one with a dog. So the dog standing up on the dog with a Christmas tree. The dog
[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:28.860]   is decorating the Christmas tree. Like that. Australian shepherds or border collie, whatever
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:33.420]   it is, they're very smart. Look at that. He's throwing that. This is shepherd, right? Yeah.
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:44.140]   She has the dog train to put away laundry. She dances with the dog. The dog is unbelievable.
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:50.380]   So when you have a bad day, you have a rock day, just go to this fee. She's does yoga with
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:01:00.380]   the dog apparently. Let's see. This is upward dog. I think they call this. Wow. Wait. Yeah.
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:10.220]   Oh, look at that. Oh, he's doing a handstand. That's not even. Okay. Now I want to get an
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:15.900]   Australian shepherd. And just go to the videos long. This is a little break. He can mop the floor.
[02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:21.260]   Yeah. And oh, paint too. He paints your she secret is the dog's name.
[02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:27.180]   Secret adores, Mop. She she was so excited. She bounced into it. I think she likes even better
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:35.500]   than vacuuming or sweeping. Well, she obviously loves her owner, my Aussie gal. Oh, oh, just phenomenal.
[02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:40.860]   You want to have one of these? It's just amazing. Where's the
[02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:45.180]   hanging up laundry? You go down for a ways.
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:57.100]   Hey, paint. You know, it's funny because I've seen all of these like here and there. I just I
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:05.020]   didn't put it all together. I know it was one dog, one dog, one amazing owner. Wow.
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:08.860]   The relationship with these two. So anyway, so I just wanted to do that to brighten everyone's
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:13.900]   day. This is this is so I'm going to get a border collie. That's all there is to it.
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:19.580]   They're smart, but you still have to train them. I mean, is that right? I mean, yeah.
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:25.580]   They won't just do this spontaneously. Is it the dance?
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:33.900]   She's I wonder is she a dog trainer or she just? She's a teenager. She's a teenager.
[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:37.260]   The relationship she has with his dog is just clearly pure love. Yeah.
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:41.420]   Well, I pity the guy who gets it between her and the dog. That's for sure.
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:48.300]   This is it. That's it. Very nice. That wasn't your number, but I like it.
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:53.020]   Well, 50 50. The dog went down the hill 50 times 50 times. I'll give you another number.
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:03:00.300]   Two billion dollars. Dogecoin. How much does coin does Robert have? Father Rob. This was a joke
[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:07.900]   currency, a joke cryptocurrency that isn't even an act of development. But just because Bitcoin
[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:13.740]   is so hot now, anything that's cryptocurrency Kodak just introduced Kodak.
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:18.460]   I didn't even know Kodak was around. I thought they were long gone.
[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:25.180]   Introduce. My favorite was Long Island. I see. They renamed their name. They renamed the company
[02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:29.020]   to Long Island blockchain. Oh, yeah. Right. Because they were getting sued or so.
[02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:33.260]   Anyway, yeah, Long Island blockchain. It has nothing to do with blockchain, but boy,
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:38.860]   it was good for business. So if you have any dogecoin, you might want to.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:43.420]   So now. Well, I hope you didn't forget your password. Let's just put it.
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:49.260]   I made them mistake of telling my wife that I had some Bitcoin many years ago and sold it or
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:59.020]   lost it or. I have a word story. I have a worst story, Matthew. I have 7.85 Bitcoin in a wallet
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:04.380]   that we created. They were donated by tweet listeners for a while. It was taking donations
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:11.660]   in Bitcoin. And I can't remember the password I used to encrypt it. But I have it. I have it open
[02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:15.900]   to my desktop and every day I try for how many times are you allowed to try in a day? There's no
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:21.340]   limit. Oh, it doesn't tell you all. It's a local wallet. It's local wallet. I see.
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:29.500]   Okay. Well, yeah, I think so because I didn't generate a password and last pass and use it.
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:34.300]   So it's not in last pass. So that means I use something made up. It's something I know that I
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:39.580]   made up. You know, like that I used a variation. And so I'm just trying all the variations. It's not
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:44.220]   good. Well, good luck. 100. What is it worth now? It's a hundred some thousand dollars.
[02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:50.620]   Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's down a little bit today. I think I had I had about 100, I think.
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:57.580]   You had a hundred Bitcoin? Yeah, because they were worth like 35 cents at the time.
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:04.300]   Jesus Matthew. Well, it was a long time ago. What does your wife say to you now?
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:10.380]   Jesus Matthew. That's like that's like a million and a half dollars with a Bitcoin. Yeah, I know.
[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:14.860]   You could buy a lot of canoes on the lake for that.
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:24.060]   By the life life hacker says don't get into Codex cryptocurrency, Codex knowing. Of course not.
[02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:27.980]   Yeah. In fact, according to Jacob,
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:32.380]   Jacob climbing a life hacker, why Codex Bitcoin scheme is a scam. You should avoid.
[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:39.820]   It's usually. Oh, they're selling a Bitcoin miner. Isn't Telegram doing a big ICO?
[02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:43.420]   Yeah, that's when I thought was kind of interesting. They're going to use it as their payment system
[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:50.940]   on Telegram. And I see that strikes me as, but again, I'm not sure they want to do a big ICO,
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:55.900]   a lot of money. That's an initial coin offering for those of you who have
[02:05:55.900 --> 02:06:02.860]   haven't been sucked in by this crazy bubble. And by the way, the guy who invented dribble,
[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:13.900]   is it dribble? Ripple. Ripple, yeah. The Ripple founder is richer than Mark Zuckerberg,
[02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:22.060]   at least in Ripple. Or was briefly, maybe not. His Chris Larson was number five on the
[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:29.740]   richest people in the world list. Number five, the problem is his three point is,
[02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:39.020]   I'm sorry, 5.19 billion ripple coin. Oh, I'm sorry. He has 5.9 billion worth roughly $60 billion on
[02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:46.700]   paper more than Mark Zuckerberg. But the value has tumbled. And he's now no longer one of the most
[02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:51.980]   rich men in the world. He's just a billionaire. Just just a billionaire.
[02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:58.620]   We're going back to the next one. By the way, now clearly, it's done. He's not not going back
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:05.260]   and forth with Gates. He's over $100 billion. Chase, I actually wrote, I wrote about a journalism
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:09.900]   startup called Civil. Have you heard of them yet? No. Are these ICOs?
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:17.180]   So they're going to do an ICO. It's basically a marketplace for journalism
[02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:24.460]   and distributed newsrooms. And they're going to payment structures going to be based on their own
[02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:33.100]   token. I just, be careful, folks. It's so tempting because there seems to be so much money involved.
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:37.660]   And I just worry that people are going to, that it's just really, they're all big pyramid schemes.
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:41.740]   I think after after the bubble, it's going to be really interesting.
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:47.500]   Like things are going to get interesting. But when will after the bubble be soon?
[02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:50.700]   Okay, maybe I better keep entering passwords then.
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:08:01.740]   This must be your story because the headline that you wrote, another tech executive sees
[02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:05.020]   damn burning bush. That was me.
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:06.940]   Exactly. No, I know. I know.
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:08.700]   I know. Ex-appable. Oh, this is Tony Fadel.
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:13.660]   I'm just sick of it. It's just constantly these guys get incredibly wealthy and they say,
[02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:18.220]   oh, it's like Oprah. It's like Oprah saying, oh, no, no, I'm going to be virtuous after I ruined
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:22.700]   television. Yeah. They're woke. Fadel. Yeah, he got woke after he made billions. He
[02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:28.700]   invented the, or designed the iPod, then started Nest. Yeah. Yeah. The most important thing that
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:32.700]   there was, now the old technology of Dix people is this bad. Come on. Come on.
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:36.380]   Now he says adults are addicts. Not only kids, Google needs to help.
[02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:42.060]   This is in response to the Apple, active investors, Janna and CalSTRS
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:48.140]   begging Apple to do something about iPhone addiction, even though they own Apple stock.
[02:08:48.140 --> 02:08:56.300]   How about you, Mr. Jeff? We got Jeff's number. How about you, Mr. Matthew Ingram? You got a pick
[02:08:56.300 --> 02:09:02.620]   or something you'd like to plug or mention before we sign off? Actually, believe it or not,
[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:08.140]   I was going to do the service overman thing. So we've already done it. Nice. I stole your thing.
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:14.140]   Nice. Well, this has been a lot of fun. It was very nice to have.
[02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:20.460]   Stacey stopped by from Vegas. Great to see Stacey.
[02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:27.340]   Great to see you. Are you, is your baby sitting, the dogs at your son and daughter,
[02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:31.580]   son in law, you like saying son in law, your new son in law in daughter's house. Is that in Toronto?
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:35.900]   No, it's in Hamilton. Okay. In nearby Hamilton.
[02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:41.980]   Nice to have you, Matthew, all the way from Hamilton. I appreciate it. Always a pleasure.
[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:46.220]   Matthew is now a writer for the Columbia Review of Journalism. You can find out more about
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:53.420]   him at Matthew Ingram dot com slash work one T in Matthew at Matthew I on the Twitter.
[02:09:53.420 --> 02:09:57.500]   It's always a person makes that mistake once. Why is there a
[02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:01.980]   then Matthew lets you know when no uncertain terms. There's always no one.
[02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:07.900]   One. Yeah. Well, I learned. I learned only one. I did not do it again.
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:17.500]   You hate to dispel some of his name. And Mr. Jeff Jarvis spells it completely normally
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:23.500]   buzz machine dot com at Jeff Jarvis. And of course, don't forget, he's got lots of great books,
[02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:30.620]   including what would Google do public parts? That's not riffs and fire and fury, which I was
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:36.780]   going to briefly. I was thinking he missed the boat. He could have called it the worst in the
[02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:44.220]   dimmest playing off David Halberstom is the best and the brightest, which apparently Steve Bannon
[02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:51.020]   gave everybody in the White House. What the best in the brightest? Yeah. Really. But it's not clear,
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:55.100]   but I think Steve might have missed the point of the book, which is you can have the best of the
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:11:00.700]   brightest and still get into the quagmire called Vietnam. But maybe he did. Maybe that's the point
[02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:05.660]   he was making. I don't know. I don't know. You know, everyone regas. Empire. Yeah. No, I don't.
[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:06.780]   Who's Evan Rodriguez?
[02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:12.380]   Aedle Rodriguez is the illustrator. He did a lot of the Spiegel and time covers that are really
[02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:18.220]   so good. Yeah. And he if you Google him, he did an alternative cover for fire and fury,
[02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:22.060]   which I think is great. Oh, let's see. See, I'll put it up on that.
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:23.980]   See, yeah, I like his work.
[02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:29.820]   Apparently there's another fire in the fury book that's selling out. Yeah, it's a 10 year old
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:38.060]   author has nothing to do with it. Selling very well. He's quite happy. All right.
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:41.900]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this weekend politics.
[02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:47.740]   Full of sound and fury and signifying nothing.
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:53.820]   We do the show every Wednesday, 130 p.m. Pacific. Oh, here's the book. Here's the book cover.
[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:59.580]   Well, no, but that's how is that? It's just fire. That was pretty. He did that.
[02:11:59.580 --> 02:12:01.980]   It's pretty. Well, you can't see it because actually it's Trump's face.
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:05.740]   That's the hairstyle. I get it.
[02:12:05.740 --> 02:12:11.900]   It shouldn't have cropped that. They cropped it. They took away all the point of it.
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:16.540]   Yeah, let's let me see if I can see the mouth there. Yeah.
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:22.780]   Should I start wearing my Oprah for president pin now?
[02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:29.340]   So you know who's going to be in Davos? Oh, who Oprah Trump? Really?
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:31.180]   He's going to Davos? Yeah.
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:33.900]   When's the last time an American president went to Davos?
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:39.980]   Clinton first like first term. Wow. So somebody suggested to me that I should get a
[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:41.980]   hat made that just as big Davos great again.
