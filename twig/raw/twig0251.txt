[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It's time for this week in Google to show the covers Google the cloud the Google verse.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Ladies and gentlemen Jeff Jarvis is in an aeroplane otherwise he would be here but filling in for him at quite ably.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Our new director Mr Mike Elgin host of Tech News today every Monday through Friday on the network
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   it's good to see you and I thank you.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Rabbit Google plus her.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   You can just call me Jeff Jarvis and I'll try to support the Chromebook Pixel and rip Verizon.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You like Chromebooks?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I love Chromebook pixels.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   But you're using a Mac?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I was on the fence. I needed after trying Chromebook Pixel for a month I went on the Chromebook Pixel diet.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Right.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I just couldn't give up that high quality screen. So I was between a MacBook Pro retina and Chromebook Pixel.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   What about the retina?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And now I regret it.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It's a tough one.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   You regret it?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Kind of.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I long for the simplicity and assurance of knowing everything's in the cloud.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Mike has 3.3 million followers on Google plus.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Wow.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Popular man.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Wow is right.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   A little point about that that's kind of interesting because there's been controversy about whether Google plus is waning
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   whether they're going to kill it, all that kind of stuff.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I sort of measure the rate of getting new users as a metric for incoming new users for the service itself.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Right.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Because I'm on the, what do they call it, the suggested user list.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   The suggested user list.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Right.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And it hasn't changed a bit.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's the same number you get every week.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Exactly.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I get 2,000 additional followers, circle friends or whatever you want to call them, a day.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And that's been consistent, give or take a couple hundred for 2 years.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Wow.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And in recent days it hasn't changed at all.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Wow.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Still getting new users.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And those are people not accidental users.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Those people who are signing up to get the follow people.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That's the key because somebody's not going to circle you unless they're actually actively going to try to use Google plus.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You have to take action as a knowing user to do that.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Right.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Wow.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So I'm going to start her, Gina Trappani from smartawear.org.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   She's of course at ThinkUp.com.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   They're in the offices right now.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And we will talk the Google, if you don't mind, starting off with, well, there's a couple of interesting stories.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   But it's really interesting.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Everywhere in Google plus you saw pictures of the self-driving car.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Yes.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   The one without the new one, without the steering wheels or brakes where you sit in the back seat.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   There's no driver in the front.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And I thought, you know, I'm seeing this line on Google plus.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Let me just check.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I wasn't on Facebook at all for me.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   So it's something Google folks are very interested in.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Everybody reshared it.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Cara Swisher got a ride in the car.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And there's a video, a promotional video that Google has put out as well.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Did you see anything on it on Twitter for you, Leo?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I saw a few of my friends on Twitter talking about it.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   They were actually referring to the car.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And there was one of my friends made up a little symbol for it.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It was like, you know, zero underscore underscore underscore zero.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And, you know, uniformly on Twitter, people were making fun of the design and uniformly on Google plus.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Everyone was just like, want, want.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So it's so interesting to see how different communities respond, particularly to Google.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I think particularly Google is, and they're sort of Google X products are very polarizing, I find.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I think it's almost too soon.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Because the first reaction I have, first of all, it's Cara called it a clown car.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's a tiny little two-seater.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And the first reaction I had is, that looks just dangerous.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yep.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I think the idea of an actual human sitting there with his hands near the wheels, I can handle.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   But you're sitting in the back seat.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   This is straight out of the TV show Silicon Valley.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   You have no control and no override.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So this particular prototype has no controls.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   The real prototypes, which are coming, they're going to build about 100 of them will have controls.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   They'll have breaks.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   This is just a demo vehicle.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah, I think that's probably more complex to have dual controls.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And they all have a bunch of safety features.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   For example, they limit the speed to 25 miles an hour.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Yeah, it looks like they were just driving in the parking lot, pretty much.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Yeah, they're in the parking lot.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I found the video kind of fluffy.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I'll be honest.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   They're in a parking lot, driving around 25 miles per hour.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   They had a young kid and an older couple and someone sight impaired, vision impaired.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And it just felt like, I mean, it was certainly a marketing video, but there was no explanation
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   about, my question was like, oh, so no one can hit the break or who's programming where
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   they're going.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   There was no interaction with the car.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It's a ton of us.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   This is not...
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   There's nobody at the controls at all.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   But to Gina's point, there isn't even an obvious mechanism for people to say where they want
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   to go.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.800]   There's a single button which starts it and stops it.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.800]   And that's it.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.000]   So it's like, okay, go.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Now, I've ridden in autonomous vehicles at CES.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Chevy, I think it was Chevy, had some urban...
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.640]   I don't know what it was, they urban assault vehicles, but they were designed for crowded
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.920]   urban areas.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.720]   They were same thing kind of a pod.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560]   It was a one person, maybe it was a two, yeah, I guess it was a two person pod.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.560]   You had no control.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.080]   The hood came down over you.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.960]   And the idea was they could daisy chain them.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.280]   One could follow another and you'd say, go to school and so forth.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   And that didn't scare me because we were in a parking lot.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.840]   This, I don't know there's something about, 25 miles an hour is not...
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.880]   If you get in a wreck with a tree at 25 miles an hour, it's not safe.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.240]   Well, in the defense of the car, what they're actually trying to do here is accelerate the
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.200]   development of self-driving cars.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.400]   So right now, if you put this electronics, this radar and lasers and stuff, that circular
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.880]   thing on the top, on top of a Lexus, so it's a half way point.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.800]   With a car like this, a purpose built car, you can have sensors built into the sides.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.320]   The front of it is very snub nose, like the front of it just goes down immediately.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.600]   That actually has a safety benefit and a navigation benefit because the sensors can
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.200]   see right down on the road.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.080]   So they're trying to sort of step ahead of where self-driving cars are going to be so
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.960]   that they can accelerate the development of it.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.040]   So that's a laudable goal.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.280]   They shouldn't be raising expectations that these things are going to be on the road in
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.720]   a couple of years.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.840]   But I think part of the goal here is to sell this to lawmakers and to the voting public.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.440]   Well, like I said, all I got was queasy.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.520]   And by the way, it wasn't a cara, it was a ride along, it was Liz Gaines who called it
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.520]   a clown car.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.960]   She's messing up the metaphor though.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.080]   Clown car is a car where lots of people get a small car.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.640]   Yeah, it's the opposite of a clown car.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.560]   This makes me think of when they inevitably have a recall, all the cars are just going
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.720]   to autonomously go in and mass back to the mothership.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.000]   Somebody in the chatroom said, "Of course you don't tell it where to go.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.560]   People already know where you want to go.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.600]   They just find the Google Now card and steer the car that way."
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.200]   She just tells your phone, like Google will drive me to work.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   Yeah, they know.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   It knows.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   All right, you, it makes me queasy.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.040]   It's kind of an obvious idea at the same time.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.040]   The fact that there's no overrope.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.040]   We're wanting things onto cars.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.840]   Why don't we just create cars that are self-driving from the start?
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   So it's kind of interesting.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   It's also a dual-force.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.040]   It was the fictional comic idea they had in Silicon Valley, of course, where in that
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.000]   scenario, Hoolie, which is the fake Google, the guy got in the car and he ended up in
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.080]   a shipping container and then ended up in the middle of the ocean.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.520]   They said, "Let me get your car.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   We'll take you home."
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.280]   He got in the Hoolie car and he says, "Home in the car."
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.960]   He says, "Okay, here we go."
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.840]   Then all of a sudden for no reason at all the car says, "Whoa, wait a minute.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   We're rerouting."
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.840]   It does a big, huge turn.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.000]   He gets in a shipping container.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   He can't get out.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.160]   Something on an island that the Hoolie founder is building is actually probably reflects a
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.600]   little bit of the real world thinking about the autonomous--
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.800]   The fear, the fear, the fear, the fear about the robots taking over.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   Yes.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   That's the thing.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.040]   That's a huge cultural uphill battle from a marketing perspective for Google to get
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.920]   consumers to accept this and get excited about it.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.640]   I think the kind of video is the beginning of that.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   I don't know.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.480]   They have a lot of work to do.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.760]   The reason that works is comic writing is that we've all had that experience with Google
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   Maps.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   We feel that way.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.760]   How many times does Google Maps let you in the middle of the ocean or something like
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.760]   that?
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.480]   You think, "Well, it's a good thing that my car isn't directly tapped into this thing."
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.960]   Anyway, I'd be mighty wet right now.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.640]   I like the idea.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.280]   What Ford always said to me is, "Well, we're going to start by driver assist and we're
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.600]   going to get you used to it by helping you."
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.440]   In fact, that's what Alan Malawi said.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   People like to drive.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.280]   We're just going to give you tools to make you a safer, better driver.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.720]   My car does that.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.280]   It knows when there's somebody in the blind spot and it tells me if I try to go in that
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   lane, things like that.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.160]   I think that's good.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   That's useful.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.600]   I just don't really like the idea of it not having any pedals or there's just no override
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   at all.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.400]   Presumably, a real self-driving car would have that.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.680]   That was the thing about the scene in Silicon Valley.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.640]   When you were saying, "No, stop."
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:04.040]   Clearly, any car that does this would be designed to have some sort of override by the person.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.440]   I had the impression that the person back at Hoolie had said to the car, "Okay, now
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.840]   we're going to the island."
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.640]   Then it changed route and he wasn't able to override that.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.640]   Whatever.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.440]   I was like, "This is really not how it is."
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   There's no humans there.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   It's all robots.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   It's all just Android.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.440]   It's all Android.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.160]   You can't get home.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.600]   Here's a 25.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.320]   Somebody sent me a Chevy Camaro crashing at 25.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   That's a Volvo.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.560]   Crashing at 25 miles an hour.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.560]   That's not terrible.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.560]   You're not dead.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.120]   You're not dead, but you're pretty hurt.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.360]   You're a front of front end is pretty smashed.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   You're not happy.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.680]   Yeah, pretty smashed up in the front wheels.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.600]   We had a conversation about this with a BBC reporter who wrote about this on Tech News
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.520]   Today this morning.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:59.160]   Hoolie is actually designing the navigation and the crash features to maximize human life,
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.440]   whether it's yours or someone else's.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.120]   Theoretically, their system will deliberately kill you if it saves a gaggle pedestrian.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   No, really?
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   We talked a little bit on this.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.120]   Exactly.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.320]   Shoe, if there's a driver with a motorcycleist in the left lane with a helmet and one without
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.640]   a helmet in the right lane and you have to quickly swerve, do you go for the guy with
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.960]   or without the helmet?
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.480]   You're saying there will actually include programming.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.680]   But what they seem to, they're vague about it.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.880]   But what they're saying is that they take into account all the people around pedestrians.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.680]   How many people will die exactly?
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.400]   How many people can we save?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   But what's the idea?
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.600]   Will they kill you to save a lot of other people?
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   Apparently.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   If my car, I should survive.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.400]   See, is that the answer to that?
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.280]   I paid for this car.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.440]   I should survive because I'm in the car.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.720]   But that's the decision people make when they get an SUV.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.520]   That's essentially what they're saying.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.960]   If we're, this is a crash, we're living.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.880]   Every human makes that decision.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.280]   That's why people buy big cars.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   Exactly.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.280]   They want to win.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:02.640]   That's why people aren't buying smart cars because it looks like you'd lose, for sure.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.960]   So the, I guess the, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   it's the premium non ad supported version.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   That's right.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   That's right.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   That's why I love it.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.240]   I expect that you prioritize my life.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   That's right.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.960]   I'm willing to pay more for my car to prioritize my life.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.240]   Wow.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.000]   We're just, by the way, this, we're being silly, but these are the kinds of things that are
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.200]   going to crop up more and more as we get towards an artificial intelligence world where the
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.480]   machines are going to start making ethical decisions.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:39.240]   And what's funny about that or what's actually not funny about that is the fact that we're
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.880]   comfortable with the status quo.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.560]   We're comfortable with the fact that cars are so dangerous because people are such bad
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.560]   drivers.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.640]   We're willing to sacrifice those victims.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.800]   But when a machine is making those decisions, even if fewer people die, we don't like that
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.440]   and we don't want it.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.200]   This is thanks to the chat room and Wikipedia.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.040]   This is called known as the trolley problem.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:12.080]   Thought experiment ethics first introduced by Philippa foot, 1967.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.480]   The general form of the problem is this.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.040]   There's a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks ahead on the tracks.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.080]   There are five people tied up and unable to move the trolleys headed straight for them.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.840]   You're standing some distance off in the train yard next to a lever.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.200]   If you pull the lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.360]   Unfortunately, you notice there's one person on the side track.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:43.440]   So you can either hit with a one person or do nothing and the trolley will kill five people.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   That's the correct choice.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.200]   See, most of us would do nothing.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.120]   I'm not going to choose.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.560]   They need to pull a rendition on snidely whiplash.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.200]   Why are people tied to the tracks?
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   Why are people tied to the tracks?
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.800]   Actually, that wasn't the original formulation they had to do with a judge and jury.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.760]   I mean, if humans tend to empathize with the individual, right?
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.000]   Yeah, that's tough.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Right.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.640]   And you could just do nothing and say, well, that's what was about to happen.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.560]   That's what I would do and say, hey, I'm washing my hands of it.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:18.320]   But you know, because this was this problem was expressed in the 60s, they weren't dealing
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.680]   with it's even a greater level of weirdness when you're writing algorithms to make these
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.680]   decisions.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.680]   Right.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.840]   If you're actually preemptively, I mean, if you're in a trolley and you have to make
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.080]   a quick decision, that's one thing.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.080]   But if you're writing--
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.280]   The algorithm is easier because it's detached from the reality of it.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.080]   So you can write an algorithm that says optimize for minimal life loss.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.360]   And that is ethical and rational and nobody's losing a life when you're writing the algorithm.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.040]   And you can see in advance what it's going to do theoretically.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   I guess.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.960]   Just maximize for minimal life loss.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   And then hackers are going to go in there.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.400]   And you have soldiers at war make this decision all the time, right?
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.640]   I mean, people commanding people in combat have to make decisions about--
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.640]   Oh, crap.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.640]   Apple just bought Beats.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.640]   Did they?
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.640]   Did they?
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.640]   They did.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.920]   3 billion, not 3.2.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.080]   It's just crossing the wire now.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   Wow.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   Wow.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.400]   You couldn't have done this during Macbreak Weekly.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.560]   I was wrong, wrong, wrong.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.440]   This is from Peter Kafka who works at Recode.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.680]   And there's the link to the Recode article.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.120]   Is there an Apple press release?
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   That's what we really want to know.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.560]   Financial Times also has the story.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.120]   Yeah, they were the ones who broke it.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.360]   Is there any confirmation from Apple, Chad?
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.720]   Do you see anything there?
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.640]   Actually the Financial Times broke the story.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.440]   And yeah, it's--
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.400]   You know, I really don't know.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.280]   The Verge says Apple has confirmed it, but I want to see Apple's confirmation.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.880]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.440]   The thing that Beats provides us is a head start, says Tim Cook.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.160]   We could build about anything that you could dream of, but that's not the question he said
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   in an interview.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.840]   The thing Beats provides us is a head start and it provides us with incredible people.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.320]   Kindred Spirits.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:02.120]   Apple says it will keep the Beats hardware brand intact as well as the Beats Music Streaming
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   Service.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.720]   It also says Beats Electronics co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre will join the company
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.920]   as full time employees.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.920]   Wow, I would have never guessed that.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:18.280]   In fact, I just didn't believe it at all, but apparently it is true and Apple is confirming.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.080]   What was that article from?
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.840]   Chad, was that the Verge?
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.680]   That was Recode.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   That was Recode.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:30.960]   I don't see it on Recode's front page.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   I hope we're not being--
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.960]   Here's the full press release.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.840]   I hope we're not being punked.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.560]   No, on the-- well, I mean maybe.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.000]   There it is.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.640]   All right.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:47.920]   I want to see this on the Apple site for I'll submit for I'll give up.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.480]   You know, the thing is we've talked about this story for what, a couple of weeks now,
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.960]   at least two and a half weeks?
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960]   Three weeks.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.800]   And there isn't much more to say other than it appears that the price is $3 billion rather
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   than $3.2 billion.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.640]   And that's actually what the leak last yesterday, the day before said, is a little less than
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.640]   they said.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:13.960]   Apple probably got a little bit-- got a cheaper price because of the video, the tireies video.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.640]   Actually the story was that because Apple found out that there were only 110,000 subscribers
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.440]   to the Beats Music streaming service, which is very small compared to, say, the 10 million
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.640]   of Spotify.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.840]   So it's interesting.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.000]   One of the things, if you search for Apple buys Beats, you find the April Fool's joke
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.440]   in the left sets letter, which is a great letter for people who follow the music industry.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.440]   Apple buys Beats, but that was apparently a joke.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.680]   This is not a joke, at least as far as we can tell.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   Apple has bought Beats.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.680]   There's been a lot of that.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.680]   I'm surprised.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.680]   I really am surprised.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.920]   And now it made sense that they would confirm this before WWDC so that they could bring Dre
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.360]   up on stage.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.760]   Here's the press release from the Apple website.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.360]   Apple to acquire Beats Music and Beats Electronics.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:09.920]   A total of $3 billion consisting of a purchase price of approximately $2.6 billion and approximately
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.640]   $400 million that will vest over time.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   Those are the handcuffs that keep Dre and Iovine in the employ of Apple.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.760]   Jimmy Iovine said, "I've always known in my heart that Beats belonged with Apple.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.320]   The idea when we started the company was inspired by Apple's unmatched ability to marry culture
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.120]   and technology, Apple's decou...
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.720]   to music fans, artists, songwriters in the music industry is something special."
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Wow, that's a shocker.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.520]   I really didn't believe it.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.520]   Music is...
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.520]   Eddy Q.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.240]   Music is such an important part of Apple's DNA and always will be.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.680]   The addition of Beats will make our music lineup even better from free streaming with iTunes
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:51.600]   radio, which already existed to a world-class subscription service in Beats and of course
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.880]   buying music from the iTunes store as customers have loved to do for years.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:03.400]   Subject to regulatory approvals, Apple expects to close in fiscal Q4, which is the next quarter
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.000]   calendar year.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.200]   That would be sometime in the third quarter calendar year.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.800]   Walter Isaacson, who Steve Jobs biographer predicted that...
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   He said it would happen.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.760]   Jimmy Iovine would run Apple's content business and that acquiring Jimmy Iovine was a major
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.120]   reason for this and he also pointed out that Iovine and Steve Jobs were friends and kind
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.960]   of had a shared vision for music.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:33.080]   The reason for that was that Iovine, when the music industry was choking on the growing
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:39.720]   dominance of the iPod and iTunes in the early days, Iovine was saying all along that Apple
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.320]   is the future of music and that's the right way to go and that's the way to monetize music
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.320]   and so on.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.520]   He kind of won over Steve Jobs for that reason.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:54.840]   He supported the iPod and iTunes in the very earliest days.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.160]   I frankly did not...
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.160]   I'm shocked.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   I didn't think it was going to happen.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.320]   I thought it seemed like a very odd marriage.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.960]   It's the first time Apple's ever bought cool instead of inventing it and it is the biggest
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.240]   acquisition Apple has ever made.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:18.000]   Another piece of news is that Beats Music iOS app just dropped their yearly pricing to $99
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.240]   and now it's a free trial.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:26.120]   So in other words they dropped the paid subscription on Beats.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.560]   But is that only on iOS?
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.320]   Let me see if I can get a free Beats subscription on the Android here.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:38.600]   They lowered the price from $1, 1988 to $99.99.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   So it's not free?
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.480]   I think there's a freemium version but then they have a subscription upgrade.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.160]   So this was part of the story.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.520]   Of course Beats is the newest streaming music service.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.920]   Beats acquired MOG some months ago which was a very good streaming service but they hadn't
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:58.080]   really gotten much traction even though AT&T offered it as a family plan for people who
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.920]   bought AT&T phones.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.320]   $16 for unlimited users on a family plan.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.360]   I broached that with my children and they said no way.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.360]   We got Spotify.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   We don't want Beats.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.360]   It's interesting.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   Interesting.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.400]   And of course Beats is on Android.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.840]   I just don't know if the deal will extend to Android.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.240]   That would be an interesting move by Apple to say.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:28.440]   Yeah we're going to make this cheaper if you're using iOS.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:34.840]   Apple's paying for the deal with $2.6 billion in cash and for him million in stock.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.440]   The New York Times is confirming that.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.440]   Right.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.280]   Well there you go.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:46.480]   I guess we'll cover this tonight on Tech News Tonight and as time goes by maybe we'll get
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.400]   some people on who can comment on it.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   Very interesting.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   I'm surprised.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   I didn't think that was going to happen.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.400]   I didn't think it was going to happen.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   I didn't think it was going to happen.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.400]   It's going to happen from day one.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.280]   It just doesn't make sense from my point of view but obviously it makes sense to Apple.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.240]   I have what you said about it.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   Go ahead play it.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.560]   We recorded this because I knew I was wrong.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   Here we go.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.680]   That's the exchange law.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   There we go.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:17.160]   It was a rumor created by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine in an attempt to sell headphones and
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.360]   stock or whatever.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   This was 17 days ago.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.760]   I got some interest in a company that is actually failing.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760]   Failing.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.760]   All right.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.760]   All right.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.760]   No need to rub it in.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   Too far.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   Actually I asked to make a recording because I thought you know if it really does happen then
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.000]   you can mock me endlessly.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.560]   Like certainly a different Apple than the one a group of this great post on during fireball
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.600]   about how like back in the day I guess it was like 2000.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:49.880]   There was a leak about an ATI radian getting included in the new Mac at the time and that
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:55.520]   jobs was so incensed and Apple was so upset that they basically ripped every single mention
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.080]   of it from the keynote at WWDC.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.080]   Yes.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.000]   They took it out of the machines.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.200]   They were punished terribly for just the leak.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.360]   So then someone the leak happened and then all that time passed I was like oh this maybe
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.640]   this really isn't going to happen.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.480]   But Leo you didn't think it was going to happen because you don't think that Apple needs to
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.000]   buy cool or that Apple wouldn't buy cool.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.360]   I don't really understand what the benefit to Apple is.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.480]   It's not the headphone business.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:28.840]   Although the revenue for Beats headphones was $1.3 billion last year.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.240]   It's not the streaming music business because it's a crappy streaming music business nobody
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.200]   would say that Apple couldn't duplicate 110,000 subscribers streaming music business.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   Easy.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.000]   In fact Apple's always eschewed streaming music.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.040]   They've had this opportunity for years and always turned away from it.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.360]   So it ain't the headphones and ain't the music business.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.920]   It's got to be Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre and whatever brand value Beats has and I guess it's a very,
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   very successful brand.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   It's a great balance.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:02.280]   But I don't know how it enhances does it enhance Apple's brand.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:07.800]   On Sunday on Twig, they said, "You're too old Leo.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.320]   You think Apple's cool still, but young people, people in their 20s and earlier don't think
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   of Apple as cool.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.560]   They think of Beats as cool."
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.800]   So this would make them think Apple was cooler because they own Beats.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.200]   I find that very hard to believe.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.760]   But I also have to point out that a number of companies have owned Beats and dumped them
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.320]   almost immediately.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.640]   HP owned Beats and dumped it.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.600]   HTC owned Beats and dumped it.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:39.360]   If it's such a great deal, why did HTC and HP get out of the Beats business?
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.240]   It doesn't make sense to me at all.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.160]   They're probably concerned about the future of Beats.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.720]   But being owned by Apple means that Beats has a really bright future.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.480]   They have obviously the most successful retail store chain ever.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.480]   Apple does.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.920]   And they'll continue to sell Beats in those stores but now more tightly associated with
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.080]   Apple.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.120]   They own 65% of the high-end headphone market.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.720]   That's the kind of position that Apple likes to be in.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.600]   And you say, "Does this make Apple cool?"
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.040]   Well, Apple is now Beats.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.240]   Beats is now Apple.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.120]   It doesn't make the Apple brand cool.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.520]   It means Apple is now in possession of the cool Beats brand.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.480]   So I think that's the next best thing to a halo effect.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.520]   Financially it doesn't matter because this is a pocket change for Apple and it pays
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.600]   for itself in three years.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.520]   And I just think that it's kind of a no-brainer.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.920]   It's highly profitable.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.360]   These things are extremely profitable.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.080]   You can build these headphones for $15 and sell them for $200.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.280]   So business-wise it's a fantastic business.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.480]   It's a really good point, Mike.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.960]   Here's my problem with it.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.240]   Apple has never done that.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.480]   It's always, and to me this is a sad day for Apple.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.240]   Apple has always said, "We're not building products to be cool.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.040]   We're not building products for high-profit margin.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.400]   We're trying to build the best products possible."
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.200]   And I don't think anybody can argue that Beats headphones are in any respect a good
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   product.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.440]   So to me it's a complete mismatch.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.240]   And I don't think Jimmy Iovine or Dr. Dre, I mean it must be for that.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.920]   And I don't know how much they bring to the table.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.480]   Surely any deal that Jimmy Iovine negotiated with the music industry is off the table as
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.120]   soon as Apple becomes a part of it.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.600]   That's a very different deal.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.280]   Apple dominates the music industry.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.880]   The music industry hates iTunes at this point because they're terrified of them.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.800]   They've been trying to make content deals with Comcast and other television companies.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:33.240]   And there's some supposition that maybe Iovine can walk into those boardrooms and make a deal.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.640]   I don't think these companies are swayed by personality.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.840]   I think they're swayed by the business.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.120]   And if the business doesn't make sense, they're not going to do it.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.960]   However much they love Jimmy Iovine.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.200]   So it remains to be seen.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.120]   I mean, just because a company buys a company doesn't mean it's a good idea just to witness
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.240]   Time Warner AOL.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:56.680]   I think I got to believe that there's something to the idea that what they purchased was membership
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.320]   in the tight knit community of the music business.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.880]   Iovine and Dr. Dre are now part of Apple.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.120]   And these folks are the, these people are inside the music.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.440]   They're way insiders.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.440]   Right?
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.840]   So that comes across in two ways.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   First of all, when it comes to making deals, it's not just the fact that Iovine himself
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.160]   can negotiate deals, but it's the fact that, you know, these Apple people are one of us
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.520]   when they go in, you know, this is the perspective by the music business.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:32.720]   The other thing is that I believe that Beats Music is viewed as some of the dynamics of
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.040]   a social network.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.320]   And if you look at how Twitter, you know, part of Twitter's secret sauce is that so
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:44.200]   many celebrities, so many famous people are constantly referencing Twitter.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:50.720]   And I think they want to have the celebrity obsessed music service, streaming music service
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.600]   and social streaming music service.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.720]   So not the Apple I know it.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.040]   This is not the Apple that is all about surface, that it's all about appearance, not the Apple
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.560]   that's all about quality.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:07.000]   Look, how quickly Apple changed when they fired Steve Jobs and when Steve Jobs left initially
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.560]   and how quickly they changed when he came back.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:15.240]   This is actually a very, very subtle change, but the Apple that you know is Steve Jobs's
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.640]   Apple.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.080]   And he's been gone for a few years now and this is the new Apple.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:26.520]   So just to repeat, the breaking news is Apple has bought Beats for $3 billion, $400 million
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.080]   of its stock options that will vest over time.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.760]   Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre will become Apple executives with the deal.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.920]   They expected to close pending regulatory approval in the third quarter of this year.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.800]   We know what we'll find out on the, of course, Apple's got a big event coming up on Monday.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   We're going to cover this live.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.600]   You and I will be here in the studio and Andy Anaco and Renee Rich.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.480]   You'll be at the keynote at WWDC and then come up here for Macbreak Weekly.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.200]   So Monday we'll be covering this starting at 10 a.m. Pacific.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   That's where you're going to see doc.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.440]   I think the reason they've announced this is you're going to see Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:07.160]   take the stage along with Angela Arance, maybe Jay Blonick, the new team, right?
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.920]   The new Apple celebrity star power team.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.360]   Maybe Johnny Ivel step up there as well.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.360]   And is it too much to hope for Eminem?
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.400]   Who Dr. Dre produces?
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   He does.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   He discovered Eminem.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400]   He discovered Snoop.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.400]   50 Cent.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.480]   Bring Snoop and 50 up.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.400]   Although don't let Fittie show a throw a baseball ball.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.560]   No, no, whatever you do.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.280]   Because that guy, he's wild.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.760]   I think it's a terrible, terrible idea.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.960]   I'll be very, there may be some interesting stuff that we'll learn later that makes it
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.400]   make sense, but I just don't think it makes sense at all.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.560]   Well, do we think Beats Music is better than Ping?
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.360]   No, it's all the, oh, Ping.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.120]   It's not better than iTunes Radio.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.360]   It's not better than any of the other streaming services.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.800]   Basically, I think all of them are seen as commodity services.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.480]   When Jimmy Iaveen launched the Beats Music service, he said, oh no, this is going to
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.840]   be all about recommendation.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.680]   We're going to get major celebrities and their playlists.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.880]   And I didn't see any of that happen with Beats.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:17.280]   It was no better or worse to be fair than Spotify, RDO, Rhapsody, all the other services.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.600]   I subscribe to Google Music.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.040]   I'm sure you do too, because we got that 799 deal.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.440]   Same 20 million songs.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   In fact, I like the Google service because I've uploaded 25,000 of my own records to it.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.600]   So it knows my music as well as all of these other songs.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   I think it's a better service.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:41.600]   I just don't see why, I guess if it's Apple branded Beats, Apple's been doing iTunes Radio
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.560]   for how many months, and no one knows about it.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.560]   That's right.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   It has no presence.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.640]   Yeah, I haven't even tried it.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:53.400]   I launched iTunes recently after a long time, and I was, I didn't know how to use it anymore.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.000]   I had to un-lump the desktop app.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.920]   I was like, I don't, what is this?
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   It just changed a lot.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.920]   Things are buried.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.800]   It was hard to find playlists.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.760]   So yeah, I didn't, I haven't tried iTunes Radio.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:09.000]   I didn't realize it was a new thing, or a relatively recent one.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.160]   Very odd.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.000]   Very odd indeed.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.160]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.680]   We're going to come back and then get the Google change log here for you.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.120]   TrueCrypt is gone.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.840]   And there's a very big story there, which we'll talk about.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:27.520]   And a whole lot more as we continue with this week in Google, which is really about anything
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.040]   we want to talk about at all.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.840]   Our show today brought to you by Hover.com.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.680]   I just registered a bunch more domains names with Hover.com.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.280]   I love Hover.com.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:46.400]   Hover is domain name, registration and management made simple, main clean, main clear.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.920]   I love, I'm a big fan of Hover.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:54.000]   As soon as I could, I had Hover, I transferred all my domains over to Hover.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.360]   They actually have a concierge service, which I should have taken advantage of.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.040]   That'll do it for you if you want to move over to Hover.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.600]   Then the domain management is as simple as it can be.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.000]   They do allow you to do email, which by the way, if you say, "Well, I'm never going to
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   want a webpage.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.800]   What do I need a domain name for?"
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.920]   You need a domain name so that you can have a professional email address with your business
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.560]   name or your family name, that you can then forward to Gmail.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.960]   You're not giving up Gmail, but you could then forward to Gmail.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:27.520]   If you decide someday that Yahoo! Mail or some other mail is better, you never have to change
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   your address.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   It's your address for life.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.160]   That's a very good reason to register a domain name at Hover.com.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:40.080]   Right now, Hover, of course, they've got all the top domain name extensions.com.net.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.040]   They've also just got the .club, which I really like.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:51.340]   If you're the international order of odd fellows here in Petaluma, you could have Petaluma
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.520]   Odd Fellows.club.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.360]   I think that's cool.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.120]   I'll tell the rest of the members.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   GinaTripanyFan.club.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.120]   Mickey Mouse.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   .club.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.120]   Don't plan to do that.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   Mickey Mouse.club.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   I love it.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:14.600]   When you register a domain name, they do not give you that 50-click upsell or anything.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.600]   They're going to give you who is privacy free on every domain that supports it.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   That's really important.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.640]   Most people want that, and they know that.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.160]   They've got great service.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:28.280]   They're no hold, no transfer phone service means when you call a live person is ready
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.840]   to help and is empowered to help and get you on your way without putting you on hold.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.840]   They're really great people.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.200]   They're Canadian, of course they're not.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   Hofer.com.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.280]   I want you to register your domain names there.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.800]   Get that new .club domain name, Florida Rotary.club.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.760]   Instead of Floridarerotorclub.com, that's cool.club.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.440]   I got a bunch of .clubs the other day.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   What do you got?
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.440]   Let's see if we can get Twit.club.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.440]   Oh, a TwitFan.club.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   I like that.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.440]   TwitFan.club.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.440]   .
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:03.440]   Maybe Seals.club.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.440]   Stop that.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.440]   I love it.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.440]   Is there a TwitFan.club?
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.440]   No.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.440]   There's TwitAddict.club.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.440]   TwitAdmirer.club.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.440]   I like it.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.440]   TwitFo.com.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.440]   Hey, one other thing I tell you if you decide to buy, please do me a favor.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.440]   Use the offer code TWIG and the number five and you'll get 10% off your first purchase.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.440]   Hofer.com.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.440]   Play the trumpets, my friends, unless we use the trumpeters up.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.440]   Because it's time for the Google Change Log.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.440]   Lot of buttons to push for chat.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   First take down the hover.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   The Google Change Log.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.440]   We'll fix it in post.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:48.440]   And now Gina Trippani has the latest from Google.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.040]   Just a couple of things this week.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.140]   Google finally launched a mobile web version of the Play Store.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.220]   So if you navigate to play.google.com and any mobile device, you'll be able to actually
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.400]   navigate the site instead of getting the big stretched out desktop version on a small
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.400]   or touch screen.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.840]   Of course, normally on an Android phone, for example, a Play Store link would launch the
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.440]   native Play Store app.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.520]   But the mobile web interface comes in handy if you're on a non-Android device or if you're
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:19.240]   looking in an app or an item that's not compatible with your current device.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.760]   The new mobile web version looks really nice and pretty long overdue.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.760]   Gotta say.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.700]   Google releases Virus Total Uploader for OS X.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:36.100]   This is a virus scanning app which Google acquired I think back in 2012.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:41.980]   And the uploader for OS X, Google's hoping to get more malware submissions to beef up
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.980]   Mac security.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.060]   Basically, you download the app onto your Mac, you run it, you can drag and drop a file
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.340]   to the virus total uploader in order to scan it.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.660]   Over 50 enter virus solutions, you can drag and drop a folder.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:37:00.440]   You can drag and drop a Mac application or you can do the open with and beef up security
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.600]   on your Mac desktop.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:09.680]   Finally, Google is, the Chrome team is taking a hard line against malicious extensions,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.600]   speaking of malware, for Windows users.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.620]   Google is now blocking Chrome extensions not listed in the Chrome web store for only for
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.400]   Windows users and only Windows users.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.280]   And they're disabling current extensions when these users have installed that aren't listed
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   in the web store.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.440]   Yeah, this is a little crazy.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.440]   So you're a Windows user, you've got Chrome installed, you've got an extension installed
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.000]   that's maybe local or you didn't get from the Chrome web store and it'll be disabled
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.840]   in the current, the stable version of Chrome.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.280]   So this new policy only applies to Windows users running the stable and beta versions
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   of Chrome.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:48.120]   It doesn't impact people using Canary or Dev or Mac Linux or Chrome OS users.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.440]   So just Windows users.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.080]   So I don't know, we're all safer for it.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.440]   If you're a Chrome user on Windows, do check out your extensions and make sure that nothing
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.440]   got auto disabled.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.440]   Thanks Google.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.440]   I use it.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.480]   Google is encouraging developers to upload their extension to the web store.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.480]   Chad?
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.480]   Go ahead Chad.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:10.160]   Yeah, I'd use an extension called YouTube Center because for our job I need to download
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   a lot.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.160]   It's like a third party.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.000]   Yeah, you go and you download it off of GitHub and then you can drag and drop it onto your
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.520]   extensions page and it'll install but it's only currently risky though.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.120]   I have to trust the source.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.960]   I guess they just don't trust users to do that anymore.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:32.200]   I wish that it had an Android like trust unknown sources checkbox that you could say, hey,
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.600]   look, I know what I'm doing.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:40.760]   Let me run this because I mean, look, I don't know, there might be a reason why a developer
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:46.800]   might not want to upload their extension to the web store a legitimate reason, for example.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.440]   So Chad, what did you do?
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.480]   Did you wind up installing like the Dev, the Canary channel?
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.880]   Well, this is actually the first time I've noticed when I normally have to do this on
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:02.000]   Fridays for a show that I do and it's I'll have to deal with that on Friday to figure
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.160]   out how to get around it.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:10.720]   Probably installing canary is what I'll have to do and yeah, work around it that way.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   That's all I got.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.600]   And that's the Google change role.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.520]   Leave the drums slowly.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.560]   Thank you, Gina, Tripp Annie.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.200]   I don't know what to make of this.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:28.560]   I don't know if this is a hack or if something serious has gone on with true crypt.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.840]   We've recommended true crypt, whole disk encryption and file encryption for a long
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.720]   time as the best choice, open source choice for disk encryption.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:45.000]   In fact, there was a crowd funded project to audit true crypt for security, which has
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.840]   already got underway a little bit and phase one is complete and there is a report true
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.680]   crypt because it's open source.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.160]   I've recommended it as a long, a long favorite choice for encryption because you can see
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.000]   if the NSA or anybody else has a backdoor in it.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.200]   But if you go today to true crypt.org, you're going to be very surprised by this notice.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.120]   And there's two possibilities.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.840]   One, that this is a legitimate notice from true crypt or the other is that it's been
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.640]   hacked.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.120]   And I don't know which is the case and nobody's reporting this yet.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:24.800]   Warning, using true crypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   This has to be.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   What?
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.880]   But this is source forage.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   Could it be hacked?
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.960]   The development of true crypt was ended in May 2014 after Microsoft terminated support
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.320]   of Windows XP.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.440]   They're encouraging to migrate from true crypt to Microsoft's closed source bit locker.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.280]   I have to think this is a hack.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.880]   But it's something we're going to watch with interest.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.360]   Steve Gibson is tweeting about it.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.920]   He says he's seen an unsubstantiated rumor that it has something to do with tonight's
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.640]   interview with Edward Snowden.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.880]   Brian Williams has an exclusive interview with the NSA Leaker.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.240]   I've got to think this has been a hack.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.040]   This just doesn't even look right.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.800]   Because Snowden has talked about true crypt.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:20.480]   He's recommended that as have I, as has Steve for years, I think this is a prank.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:27.440]   But I'm just going to point it out and we'll wait and see with interest what happens.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.000]   It doesn't seem like if this is how an open source project would terminate itself with
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.280]   a recommendation to use bit locker.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.800]   I think this is almost certainly a prank.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.480]   It's not very funny.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.480]   I'm not laughing.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.440]   There have got to be other places where true crypt is true crypt.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.520]   Have a Twitter account or another page.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.520]   Yeah, let's see.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.200]   The truth is that org redirects to source forage.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.200]   True crypt.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   That source forage.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.560]   That's a good question.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   Let me see if there is a Twitter account because maybe they're saying something on the Twitter
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   account.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.400]   Is true crypt audited yet?
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.760]   That's real.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760]   That's actually a real site.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.400]   That's the crowd source project that we're talking about.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.320]   They say import.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:23.620]   There is a thread going on at Hacker News where people are talking about it in order
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:27.440]   of likelihood to face site time to screw up a big announcement.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.200]   Rogue code maintainer or face to have audit turned up something rather bad.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.340]   I don't think it's the case.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.200]   I think it has to be a prank.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:40.240]   There is a new binary on there which I would not recommend downloading.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.780]   It's a .exe file.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.780]   Do not.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.780]   It's dated yesterday.
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:50.260]   But the signature matches which is a little concerning.
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.140]   It's not how an open source project would terminate things however.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.240]   No, no, it doesn't.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.240]   They've been hacked.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.680]   I would almost certainly say.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.520]   Which is kind of sad.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.580]   Could it be you're an open source expert Gina?
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:13.080]   It could it be a bad commit that would include a page change?
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.240]   You know, I haven't used source forage.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.080]   I'm not sure how that works.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.460]   I know that on GitHub, you can manage the site.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:26.620]   You can manage the actual pages for the user facing website in GitHub.
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.820]   So yes, on GitHub that would be possible.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:34.900]   Someone could, if they got gained commit access, commit master access to the repository, could
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:39.220]   actually update the website to say, you know, use BitLocker instead.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:44.900]   Steve's pointing out, as I mentioned, as is mentioned on Hacker News, that the .exe
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.520]   is signed by the same key as the normal true crypt sign.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.080]   The signature is correct.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.680]   But that means just more a bigger hack.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:59.560]   If you ask me, I don't think that that's, I mean, I don't know what this means.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:05.480]   This is not how things would normally enter.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:10.840]   But with any open source project, you know, things can go south in odd ways.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.480]   We'll follow this.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   Any software project.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.220]   Any software project.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.220]   Wow.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.740]   That is just weird.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.740]   We'll follow that.
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.060]   Continue to follow that with interest.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.620]   And again, so now there's two big stories for tech news tonight.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:29.620]   If you want to go to breaking news, Mike Elgin, please be my guest.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.460]   Wow, what a day this has been.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.660]   What a weird, weird day.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.380]   Let's take a break while people can gather their thoughts and we can figure out what's
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:42.900]   going on here and come back with more.
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.980]   We'll have some Google stuff.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:45.980]   I'm sure.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.980]   We will.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:51.140]   Although the next big story is Yahoo planning YouTube rival.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.760]   Okay, that's Google.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.660]   It's an anti Google story.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.160]   Our show today brought to you by personal capital with personal capital.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.980]   You finally can get everything about your financial life in a single spot.
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:09.180]   Know exactly where you stand personal capital.com/twig.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.140]   And you can find out more about it.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.140]   Here's the deal.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.300]   I need to kind of explain this.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.980]   I've talked to personal capital folks.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.740]   In fact, I've known them for two years when Ed, I'm sorry, Bill Harris, the founder of
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.980]   personal capital was on triangulation.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:26.660]   He was on triangulation to talk about a lot of things, including money, authentication,
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:30.580]   Bitcoin, all of that stuff, former PayPal CEO and Intuit CEO.
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.900]   And he mentioned just kind of offhandily and I'm starting this new thing, personal capital
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.220]   and we talked about that.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.700]   I joined it at the time.
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.460]   There's a couple of routes you can follow if you're planning for your future.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:46.300]   And most of you probably do this, I hope you invest money.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.300]   You save it.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:52.060]   Maybe you have a brokerage account with one of the big online brokerages and you just
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:53.060]   kind of do it yourself.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.700]   And I bet you don't pay as much attention to it as you auto.
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.260]   The other choice people have, of course, is to go to a bank or to one of the storefronts
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:03.780]   and get a broker and let him tell you what to do.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.860]   Ever went for that myself?
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.580]   I'm kind of like to do it myself.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.140]   But in both cases, you may not be getting the best advice.
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.260]   You may not really be managing your money right.

[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.940]   And this is really important and let's not gloss over it.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.460]   Allocation of your portfolio.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:41.460]   That's very important.
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.060]   How much is in equities, international equities, United States equities, how much is in bonds.
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.700]   You'll learn all about that with a single click of the mouse.

[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.340]   your 401k.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.340]   You don't want to do that.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.540]   A mutual fund fee calculator and a lot more.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.420]   Now here's how they make money.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:12.180]   They are certified financial planners and not everybody will get this treatment.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:16.580]   But if you wish you can have advice from them, they're not selling anything.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.580]   They're not salesmen.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.460]   They're there to give you that advice.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:23.340]   But if you want to just use the software you can, it's kind of the best of both worlds.

[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.860]   tw I
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.520]   G we heard this rumor before
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:58.180]   that Yahoo was going to build its own YouTube
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.820]   at age is now
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.260]   confirming it because
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:07.680]   Yahoo, I guess is approaching creators and advertisers. So you can't keep this kind of stuff
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.780]   Secret for too long. What do we know about Yahoo's YouTube?
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.940]   anything
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.620]   Well, we know that they are expensive
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:22.500]   The ad rates are 50 to 100 percent higher than YouTube. Yeah
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.260]   YouTube is not expensive
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:27.960]   According to Tube mogul, which Chad always is recommending
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.940]   The cost per thousand is under ten dollars
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.140]   for YouTube
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.980]   Which is actually
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.300]   That's what radio is it's not what we are. We're a lot more. We're about seventy dollars
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:46.780]   Yahoo's not commenting of course, but they have been apparently approaching
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.700]   some big names on YouTube saying hey
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:55.220]   You know when you want we could give you more money if you come over here because along with that bigger ad bill
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.860]   They would also be able to pay more
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:03.700]   They're ramping up talks according to ad age with video producers plan to debut this summer
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:10.940]   They wanted to do an upfront in April. That's where you go to advertisers and tell them what you're going to do and
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.740]   Sign up long-term contracts. That did not happen
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:20.860]   They're telling YouTube creators more generous revenue sharing deals or fixed ad rates that are higher
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:26.500]   So you know exactly how much you're going to make creators will be allowed to establish their own channels
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.580]   Host their videos in Yahoo. Just like YouTube
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:34.580]   And just like YouTube Yahoo's video player will be embeddable on other sites
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:44.660]   Publishing dashboard Chad you're YouTube guy. Yeah, would this be compelling and the key is it's not exclusive
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:48.300]   I think right it would have to not be exclusive especially in the beginning
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:56.340]   Unless if someone wants to take a really big risk the the biggest issue that I see is YouTube is just the portal that a lot of
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:02.180]   People a lot of younger people that's where the people are that's where they are they they go to it like
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:09.860]   Like their homepage they they show up there almost like Netflix to find out what's going to entertain them today and
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.340]   Getting and changing that
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:20.420]   Behavior is by far the hardest thing that Yahoo would have to do. I'm excited to hear that there might be competition
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:27.300]   Right now the on on the YouTube creator side YouTube takes 45% of revenue
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:34.180]   And if if Yahoo is to come in and say not only are we charging our advertisers 20 to 50% more
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.060]   You're also going to get 20 to 50% more
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.820]   from us from from our
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:43.820]   ad revenue that that would be some amazing competition
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:51.100]   Yeah, it seems like that's the opportunity right is to treat creators better than YouTube has been treating them and but then it's just but then like
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.500]   Like Chad said getting viewers to switch over
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:58.900]   Right because people like because you viewers aren't finding their videos embedded on web pages, right?
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:06.660]   They're going to do yeah. Yeah, yeah, and of course there are gonna be a lot of creators on YouTube who feel like they're just not getting any traction
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:11.140]   They're not getting the traffic they want. I mean there are a few stars and we always focus on the big stars
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:15.420]   But for every star there's a hundred thousand people who are not able to really become
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:20.900]   Famous and they'll be happy to jump ship and try to become stars in the new network if this in fact happens
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:27.060]   Of course Yahoo failed acquired daily motion for 300 million dollars some time ago Marissa Mayer has
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.660]   Basically been talking about building a YouTube like
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:36.700]   Presence for Yahoo for a long time and you know essentially before Yahoo her only job was Google
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:43.020]   So she's been sort of aggressively trying to recreate Google Yahoo to a certain extent and this is a big big part of it
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:50.380]   Funny how she's just doing the Google roadmap one after another that's probably why they hired her because every time Yahoo tried to
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.860]   You know
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:57.340]   Compete in the new world where portals are no longer a relevant cultural phenomenon
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.420]   Google is always there eating their lunch
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:04.820]   So I think that to a certain extent they failed with multiple CEOs and when they went with Marissa Mayer
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:08.740]   They basically said you know, let's let's be the new Google
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:12.860]   Let's let's compete with Google on its own terms and she's been aggressively doing that mostly
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:18.980]   Using the old model which is just keep buying things and keep shutting things down and that's gonna be the problem
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:23.540]   She's got to face that reputation when she goes to creators and says please come here
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:27.340]   As long as it's not exclusive I could see people doing it
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:32.660]   They're not gonna lose their YouTube presence and they have the potential to make some more money one thing Yahoo has that
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.020]   Is pretty powerful tumbler tumbler tumbler exactly
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:40.340]   There's a huge network of a lot of young people and it's a distribution network
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:46.420]   That's got a pretty good reputation among certain crowd of people and it's viral. It's it's highly
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:51.980]   It's a highly highly viral social bloggy kind of a service that is perfect for
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:58.980]   For video you can't right now. Can you post video on you done a tumbler? You used to be able to you can't still
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it works with a couple different sites
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:07.540]   I'm sure that there are plenty of people out there who would love to make their living making videos
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:13.580]   And if Yahoo can enable who maybe couldn't you know couldn't do that with the with the YouTube deal with it any deal
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:15.780]   They get with YouTube if Yahoo can offer that to them
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.020]   And you know, I don't know that I don't know that
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:22.460]   Meyer is really building Google. I mean this makes sense because it's content, right?
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.260]   And that's what Yahoo is its content
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.980]   It seems like she in the company is is committed to making great content
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:32.540]   And this is this is what this you know this seems like that's this is the direction. It's going in
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:39.300]   It does fit what Yahoo's been all along which is a contact right right right and boy
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.820]   There's no better way to you know play the game than to create
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:47.940]   Video site although let's not forget that yahoo brought broadcast
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:52.940]   Dotcom which was also many moose and go from our Cuban made him a billionaire and
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.340]   Shudd it shuddered it within a year
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:03.100]   Well, you know a good like you said Chad let's have some competition nothing wrong with that. Yep a
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:08.340]   Great idea and speaking of competition Google. I have to admire Google
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.260]   You know when they started Google fiber they always said this isn't a business for us
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:16.220]   We just want to show the path and what's happened is in almost every market where Google has announced gigabit fiber
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.820]   The other incumbents in the market have said oh
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:26.020]   We can do that a first the reaction was who is that from time Warner? Oh, we don't think our customers really wants nice like that
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:28.460]   Yeah, but now everybody
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:35.340]   Cox is gonna start its gigabit rollout in in Phoenix Las Vegas and Omaha, Nebraska
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.660]   AT&T is starting gigabit
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:45.820]   Rollouts as well. This is good Google did the right thing. Yep. They they kicked everybody in the behind
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:53.380]   And they have the best service out there. They really Google fiber is if you're in a Google fiber area
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:57.940]   The cost per speed or whatever would no matter what metric you use
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:03.500]   They just have the very best service and it's just fantastic to see them driving competition
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.180]   I just hope that they get into all these cities
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.900]   There's a long list of cities that they intend to get in as of today
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:13.980]   They're only in two cities, which is Austin and Salt Lake City. I believe I'm sorry. No, it's Kansas City
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:19.860]   Right Kansas. They started in Kansas City and Provo you then they moved to Provo and they're looking at Austin
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:23.940]   They're Austin's probably next on the ball though Austin now has a number of choices according to Brian
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:27.540]   Right T and T. Yeah, exactly. So exactly as you're saying
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:32.700]   But there's really bugs me because all of these companies have said all we can't do that it'd be too expensive
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:37.540]   Nobody wants it and as serious Google comes in the market wait a minute we can do that
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:41.780]   Well, but to their defense essentially what AT&T's position was is that
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:48.380]   All these companies have wanted to lay fiber wanted to do all kinds of things and cities have been dragging their feet saying
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.620]   Well, you have to go through this process
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:54.340]   You have to go through that process and Google did something really bold. They said we're having a contest
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:56:00.180]   We're having tryouts make it make it fast and they had everybody competing against each other and that competition
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:04.380]   Behind the scenes of that competition was city government saying you know what?
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:08.660]   We're just gonna green light all this stuff that normally we're gonna get rid of all the red tape for you and we promise you
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:15.420]   We're not gonna give you any obstructions and then Google cherry picked those markets and once they've got those those
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:20.900]   All that red tape swept away other companies can then come in and say well if that's how we're doing it
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.020]   Then we'll do it too
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:27.820]   So Google I think the genius of this was the sort of DARPA grand challenge approach where you have a contest and you have
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:32.300]   City governments competing with each other and the city governments woke up and then they're gonna do the same thing
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.660]   I presume for these other gigabit providers now
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:39.940]   Maybe Google will do exactly the same thing for open internet for net neutrality. They've said
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:45.540]   publicly at Google fiber we don't charge for peering and we don't have fast lanes
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:48.340]   That we think this is good for customers
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:54.380]   We from the blog post we don't change we don't charge because it's really a win-win-win situation
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:57:00.740]   It's good for content providers. I'm gonna raise my hand here because they can deliver really high quality streaming video to their customers
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:05.580]   It's good for us because it saves us money. It's easier to transport video from a local server
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.060]   Oh, they're talking about caching local caching right a co-location
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.260]   and
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:16.780]   Netflix has offered this the open connect system for some time now. We had a great conversation
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:22.380]   I want to point people to the conversation we had yesterday on security now Steve Gibson brought in
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:29.180]   Brett Glass who you probably know we've all known for years. He was a longtime writer for you probably worked for you a PC world
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:31.940]   I think he definitely wrote for us. Yeah
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:36.100]   He's also worked for info world and he I think he writes for PC Meg
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:41.740]   But he's also a internet service provider. He does a wireless internet service in Laramie, Wyoming
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:45.460]   Yeah, I'll Larry it done that and he was very adamant
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:51.420]   That any kind of internet regulation would be a bad idea not just for him, but for customers
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:56.940]   And that the idea of net neutrality cannot in any way be pursued
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:02.780]   Reasonably by the FCC without causing huge problems and he actually I think he made a very coherent case why the
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:07.180]   Title II regulation that we've been calling for the telecommunications act
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:13.260]   Regulation that would say the FCC declares the broadband providers common carriers
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:18.020]   He said that's gonna the kinds of regulation that would bring in would really become a problem
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.280]   Then you got the government really with its hands in the gears
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:27.340]   So he made a good case there. I'm not sure he made such a good case for why internet service providers should charge edge providers as well as
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:31.440]   Its customers, but it's a good conversation. I highly recommend
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.940]   security now yesterday
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:38.100]   For that and I and and thank you Google for making the
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:40.700]   Making the world a little bit better place
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:46.420]   Well, you know, it's funny that they as you know, they they step forward in a blog post as an
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:52.460]   ISP Google fiber as an ISP and said, you know, we don't believe in this payment for
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:57.580]   Access because guess who the number two is it's YouTube, right? They're the right
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:04.660]   Right and that's a much bigger equation kind of what Brett said is it's very easy for them to say this as an ISP
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:09.740]   But you know what frankly their business is right on the other side and they've never admitted to paying
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:13.260]   But it's all they almost certainly have to they have to and they do believe in
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:19.220]   Location, which is where you essentially mirror everything you mirror everything that Netflix has in your service to deliver it to the last mile
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:24.740]   And that's a good thing for everybody and and we need to constantly remind people that whenever we talk about net neutrality
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.900]   We're talking about the last mile. We're not talking about peering relationships at all right
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:33.020]   It's about your drive way. We're talking. That's right
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:38.100]   The information you covered this I'm sure on tech news today a couple of days ago
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:43.780]   Yep, the information said that Google is thinking via its nest division about buying drop cam
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.820]   We love those drop cam the wireless cameras. We have them all over the studio
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:52.660]   They're Wi-Fi based they're good to be a nice appliance to add to but
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:59.660]   Do you think it would raise Gina any issues with people to have to know that you have a Google owned camera in your house?
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.660]   Oh, good heavens
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:07.940]   You know with nest and whatever I'm now I have a child of the age where I'm now we're now talking about nanny cams and that kind of thing
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:13.860]   Drop Cam you'll love it. Yeah, it's a great product. Yeah, you can see our drop cams
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:17.380]   I don't know how many of them are up. Let me see twit.tv/dropcams
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.260]   is the website and
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:29.060]   Let's see if any of them are up because it what we take them down right because why because they break no we don't take them
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:34.260]   Oh, okay. So you see we have there's only one offline. That's the my office
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:38.820]   I think somebody comes in and unplugs that but you can see chat at work here
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:42.700]   You can see we actually we use it to monitor our reception
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.140]   Desk because we don't always have some a the front desk
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:50.300]   So we we monitor the front door, you know the once again Google tends to
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:57.660]   Line up with the rational argument and expects the public be rational which they never are so it's an emotional argument to say that
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.820]   We don't want Google cameras in our house in fact. We all have them already
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.500]   Who's looking at us right? You got a camera
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:12.580]   You have an Android phone you have a tablet these things have cameras in them. They're already pointed inside your house
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:22.460]   So it's you know, it's but you know this is this is gonna be a great couple of years from now for the next couple of years
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.620]   And coming up on Google I owe and WWDC we're gonna hear about this
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:32.500]   We're finally getting to the point where we have consumer level home automation and that's gonna involve cameras
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.580]   It's gonna involve sensors. It's gonna involve gadgets. It's gonna involve
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:42.580]   You know API's full and that's what really I believe we're gonna hear about at WWDC and also Google I owe
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:48.980]   Lots and lots of API's remember like two years ago Gina was at three years ago two years ago when Google was talking about Android at home
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:53.060]   And then and then and then silence right nothing
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:56.220]   So I'm certain that that's coming back this year
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:02.620]   Everybody's gonna be talking about home automation. This drop cam is a play for home automation now drop cam also makes a little inexpensive
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:06.340]   Device that you can just attach to anything and it's a motion detector
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:10.180]   So if that little device moves you get a notification and the notification can tell you
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:15.900]   Anything you wanted to tell you so you you it has a sticker so you put it on a window when the window opens
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:20.220]   You get a notification said somebody open the window or you put it on you think this is great
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.980]   You know it's sensors I you know of course
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.300]   We heard the rumor that the Apple would be announcing something on Monday at WWDC
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:31.300]   Yeah, I can do with home automation. I think that's gonna get overshadowed a little bit by the new news. Yeah
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:36.660]   Maybe they will do that maybe they won't do it that but I think a lot of attention is gonna be paid to beat in the press
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:40.660]   But that's a developers conference and the developers won't care about the people care about beats at all
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.660]   They very want to hear about the mission exactly
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:47.980]   Mary-Miecker could just I'm gonna put on a wig here and just call me Mary
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:53.340]   Every year Mary-Miecker does a presentation. She's with the Kleiner Perkins Cofield buyers
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:57.540]   She is considered as before that she was a Wall Street analyst
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:05.020]   She's considered probably the person to watch when it comes to internet prognostication today
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:09.260]   She did her annual state of the internet speech and
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:13.140]   Thank you, Mary-Miecker for she puts her slides up every year
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.940]   She's I'll tell you these are the slides
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:22.420]   They're rich with content. So I haven't had a chance to look at these they just went up
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.300]   But I'll we can we can talk a little bit about them
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:32.060]   The high-level user usage trends the big one to me mobile data traffic is up 81%
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:37.140]   Hugely accelerating growth and he she says the video is the driver here
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:42.660]   That's it to me interesting. It's interesting for our business, but it's interesting in general. Yeah
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:49.300]   Tablets 52% early stage wrap-it unit growth. She says tablets are very hot not a surprise
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:55.220]   Although I predict we're gonna see a drop-off in tablets. I really think that we're not already seeing a drop-off
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.860]   I thought Apple did Apple did they did okay Apple did but that was one quarter
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:06.380]   So I don't know if that's enough it's shifting away from the high-end Apple disposable income people to the low-cost
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:13.140]   global, you know inexpensive Android take away from that slide is mobile usage growth is very very
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.780]   strong
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:19.140]   81% over the year smart phone users
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:24.580]   Only at now in the US it's something like 80% are smartphone users
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:31.780]   But notably only 30% of the potential 5.2 billion mobile phone user base only a third is
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:36.420]   Smartphones, so there's a big upside, but the upside is not in the US
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:40.780]   And you can see the trend is really strong speaking of the US. She has an interesting
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.820]   Interesting stat here. She says that 97% of smartphone
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.420]   market share are made in the US
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.700]   Operating systems like Android iOS
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:57.660]   When interesting and so on 97% remember when the Nokia is a US company
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:01.500]   That matters not that their market share is a
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:10.540]   Other platforms are pretty big. Yeah, it's true. That's true, and they're now also in the look at this look at these tablet
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.580]   sales
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:18.620]   Graph the green line is desktop PCs going down blue line networks
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:25.740]   No book PCs going up, but the yellow line the one that just appeared all of a sudden in 2010 is already
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:33.020]   Growing faster than PCs ever did 50% of the markets tablet. We're definitely in a post-PC era
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:37.580]   I wonder though in the next three years what that graphs go like if it might just look like a spike
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:43.860]   Yeah, you know and I think the reason I say that is because I think I agree with her mobile is where it's at mobile phones
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:49.500]   Or the that's where the big growth is going to be but she says tablet has a lot of growth ahead of it
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:55.620]   She says 66% which is two-thirds of tablet owners surf the web all watching TV
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.380]   Two-thirds of tablet that's true in our house. Yeah, yeah
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:05.020]   Two-thirds of us watch when they I'm the only one sitting and actually watching the TV
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:12.500]   Isn't that true? It's true. I watch the show. They're doing their tablet thing and everyone's a while. They say what happened?
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.060]   What was that? What just happened?
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:19.740]   How about at your house Gina? Yeah, a hundred percent hundred percent
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:29.540]   So disconcerting to me and now I know I am old because nobody pays attention to anything anymore, you know
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:36.340]   Gina that's not true your baby isn't using a tablet this two-thirds of your house - she is not but she demands Elmo song
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.340]   On my phone
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.140]   She sees my phone she demands Elmo Wow
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:46.440]   Internet advertising growing and mobile is 40% is up 47%
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:53.260]   Still a lot of room for growth there. That's huge growth. Oh, and that was the question was it
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.300]   How do they monetize mobile? Well, apparently somebody's figured out. Yeah that
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:01.820]   Print remains way over indexed. I think that means it's not good
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:08.740]   Mobile app revenue still trumps mobile ad revenue. You want to make money on mobile sell an app not an ad?
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.740]   68% of mobile revenue is apps
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:15.300]   She talks a little bit about cyber threats
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.660]   Which this is depressing
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:25.860]   A vulnerable system placed on the internet today will be compromised within 15 minutes
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:31.660]   95% of all networks are compromised in some way
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.860]   Oh
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:37.340]   Let's move on shall we
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:41.020]   Then she's talking about this is this is a really great slideshow
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:46.060]   You've got to kind of parse through it and there's as you can see she loves dense slides
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:51.100]   I would love to be at that event and see how long she spends per slide. I think she goes whizz whizz whizz
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:56.620]   I'd like to see Edward tough to review her. Yeah, no Edward did not be happy not be happy
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.340]   Just talking about education. There's reason for optimism eight and ten
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.980]   Americans say they care about education
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:07.660]   Graduation rates are rising from high school. That's good
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:16.620]   Online courses making a big difference here for instance year-to-year econ Academy's YouTube channel has grown 69%
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:21.940]   iTunes you open university downloads up 59%
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:30.620]   Seven million students enrolled in Coursera courses. This is good. That's that's really makes me makes me happy
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:37.100]   Here's comparing Duolingo, which is a language platform. We highly recommend with Coursera
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:44.060]   It's very much international. The red is North America on both these pie charts and you can see that
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:50.780]   29% of international of users for Duolingo are in Latin America
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.860]   30% are in Europe 11% are in Asia
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:02.780]   And it's actually pretty well distributed in Coursera. This is kind of cool that yeah, 25% of Coursera users are in Asia
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:09.340]   23% are in Europe 11% are in Latin America 6% are in Africa. Oh, she uh, that's pretty neat
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:12.380]   Yep, although they're wasting their time the technology
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:19.260]   What the technology for a simultaneous translation is getting so good and you see that Microsoft demo the Microsoft did
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:25.820]   At recode. No. No, what was that? Yeah, they they all play it for you. Yeah, they and I'll I'll sort of
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:33.420]   Give a preamble to it. Microsoft demonstrated a future version of Skype that they said is coming out soon that simultaneously translates
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:41.500]   What's your your conversation? So you talk in one language and you say okay translate this into German and within a second the translation is on the screen
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:47.660]   And then it's read by a computer and then that person talks in that foreign language and it's read back in English now. Don't feel
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:53.660]   Bad Google lovers because this is uh, I'll skip ahead a little bit
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:57.580]   But don't feel bad because you know that google is going to show something like this at google
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:02.380]   Because google's got this core technology. That's right, but this is very cool. Go ahead and turn up
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:07.740]   And that's a gentleman who demoed it for over a decade. See this is not the demo and I I want to find it
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:11.180]   But he's talking to a German colleague. He's speaking English
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:16.300]   She's speaking German and Skype is simultaneously translating it. Let me see if I can
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:24.300]   This is not the clip that I thought it was uh, the demo recode is perhaps better than this. Let me go back and uh, find that
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:31.260]   Um, yeah, but it's it's it's it's we're entering into a new world of translation where so many different apps are getting
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:38.060]   Really great translation technology. It's still not perfect. Even this isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn good and very fast. Yeah
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:43.740]   Yeah, yeah, so I'll show you jina because you you'll want to see this. Let me get out of the ad
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.540]   There's a don't advertising there's a microsoft ad. I
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:52.220]   Don't you hate advertisements?
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.460]   Here you go. Yeah, so um, he's uh, he's speaking
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.860]   Hello, the honor
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:02.620]   Vidia. Oh, wait a minute. Now that's that's that's actually the translations. Let's go back a little bit
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:06.540]   Right. He's going to speak to his German colleague in english. How are you doing?
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:12.700]   Hello, the honor vidia. That was about a second second and a half
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.820]   Hello, my point
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.900]   Hello, my friend. Even I understood that
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.780]   It's kindergarten German. That's right
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:28.060]   There's there's actually some complex sentences that little later on and it actually the english transcription isn't perfect
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:34.940]   No, and the Germans in the audience said that the German wasn't pretty it wasn't perfect, but understandable. That's the key right? That's right. Yeah
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:37.500]   Yeah
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.420]   It's still going to be better than if you take, you know six weeks to learn a foreign language
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:50.060]   Can you imagine us doing shows with international contributors who don't speak english sometime in the near future? Wouldn't that be amazing?
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.900]   We should do that
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.900]   It's on purpose
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.180]   They say this will be available in a beta test later this year
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.580]   We are off of their port to Belosstrasse
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:07.100]   Her German on the other hand is excellent. Yes. Yes, very clear. Camden town
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.820]   Wouldn't it be fun? Yeah, but really I mean we're 10 years from now
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.060]   I mean come on it's going to be so great to have all this you know on the one hand
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.940]   It's gonna be great to be to be able to translate everything on the other hand
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:23.260]   It's really going to suck the wind out of everyone's motivation to learn a foreign language
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:29.900]   Because what's the point? You know, that's that's really cool. That's really cool. I have to say but you know doing a show like that
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:33.820]   I mean there's a reason why on tv they edit it so that the translator is speaking
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.340]   You know kind of over the person right because it's just so slow
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:41.340]   There's those long awkward pauses if there was any cross talk whatsoever. It would get weird
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:45.100]   That's why I really like that app that the I don't know if it's a glass app or if it's a phone app where you
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.420]   Pointed out, you know word lens
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:54.860]   Were word lens changes it and it's in the same file like that feels really seamless and magical to me like that skype demo was pretty was pretty cool
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:58.220]   Um, but that's that would be a long tedious conversation
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.340]   Right, of course google just bock a word lens and I think I think google if anybody as well
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.100]   The best situated to do this. That's right google translator is already phenomenal
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.740]   Yeah, and I imagine they'll have this kind of capability
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:14.460]   You know, I believe in a category of computing that is really just barely getting off and I call it
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.540]   Herable computing
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:21.100]   Uh, where you essentially have an earpiece where everything is language. So you talk to it. It talks to her
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.740]   Yeah, exactly
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:25.740]   But but this area
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.900]   I haven't seen it yet. It's on my list. Oh
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.660]   My god, I know everyone loved it. That's why it's been on my list. I'm just having a good time
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.820]   That's where we're going and try think about that for translation. You talk and it tells you
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.860]   So kiano kiano reves. I'm sorry
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.900]   Phoenix walking
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:47.420]   His brother walking phoenix is uh, uh, attractive good looking guy
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:52.860]   Yes, he wears high water pants, but apparently everybody in the future will so that's okay. I'm the most depressing fact
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.500]   Yeah, well, we're gonna be wearing high water pants
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:59.500]   Uh, but uh, he is a little lonely. He's just gone through a divorce
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:03.260]   And he buys the new operating system o s one
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:08.380]   And you turn it on and it's it you you boot it up and it says hi
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:13.660]   And you say hi and then and it's amazingly enough sounds just like scarlet joe hansa
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:18.380]   Which I personally would like well and she's very cute and breathy and he does things like he says
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:23.660]   Why do you do that? She says what you you take a breath in between you don't need to breathe your machine said
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:27.740]   What do you you're pissing me off?
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:35.100]   She says I that's how humans communicate that's that's right and uh, he says you but you don't need to breathe
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:39.260]   She's why are you you're hurting my feelings eventually? She does in fact become more and more human
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:41.980]   He falls deeply in love with her and then it turns out
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:45.260]   He's not alone. His neighbors are falling in love
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:48.460]   Everybody's falling in love with their os1 computer
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:53.420]   There's a whole business apparently of surrogacy. We were getting to that later. Yeah, but uh,
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:15:00.140]   I thought it was fascinating the issues it raises are fascinating and the UI is great because you're just talking with it
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.020]   Right. That's exactly because that's the human. That's what I mean
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:07.580]   That's the new earpiece and these that's user interface, but basically imagine traveling
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:10.700]   You were recently traveling and in in turkey and elsewhere
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:14.300]   It's like about the bablefish now. Yeah, so exactly so imagine being in turkey
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:18.940]   And and just talking just saying out loud, you know computer or scarlet joe hansa
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:23.100]   Whatever the command is to wake it up and say translate from turkish
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:26.700]   And then you walk into the bakery and you say, you know, it tells you what to say
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.580]   And then when the person talks you hear the english in your ear
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:32.380]   That's a fantastic user interface for translation
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:37.500]   The thing that they got wrong in her is that yeah scarlet joe hansa is the default voice
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:41.660]   But in the future we'll be able to easily choose any voice including scarlet joe hansa
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:45.740]   No, he has uh, didn't he get a choice at the beginning of did he? Yeah, I think he did
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:48.060]   You get the you know, so yeah, would you like a man a woman?
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.380]   But you know ways he didn't get the choice
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:54.700]   Man a woman, but you'll be able to choose from any celebrity in fact
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.820]   We were um ways has a feature where he can choose elvis
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.620]   Yeah
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:02.700]   As the person and we were using it the other day and it's like a common up on the right turn left
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:07.180]   And it's like I did not spoil her for anybody believe me. That was not a spoiler in any way
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:12.540]   Yeah, I didn't I pitched this movie to my wife a few times like a dude falls in love with an operating system
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:15.980]   He's like no, you gotta see it. No, no, no, no, no, it's a beautiful movie
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:18.940]   I mean, it's really a beautiful. Yeah, I mean it looks beautifully shot and yeah
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:21.660]   I just gotta watch it on my own. I just don't think it's gonna happen
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.060]   Adjointly did you like at least and at least I didn't like it
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:27.500]   But she was working on her iPad the whole time. Yeah
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.020]   Life is part of the 66 percent
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:38.220]   No, no, you thought it was a little slow a little slow and boring pressing and it is to you know what it is depressing
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:40.460]   Yeah, she she found it very depressing
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:44.940]   It's depressing because that sort of thing is definitely going to happen there are gonna be a lot of in fact
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:47.420]   It already happens to a certain extent. I want to know where I sign up
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.860]   Yeah, guys marry their pillows pillows and stuff like they carry them around on the subway and that's a little weird
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:58.620]   Yeah, that's weird, but you know, it's people are lonely people will have options
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:03.180]   I guess I thought it was great and I didn't spoil it because there's a lot more after that
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.220]   In fact, it gets even really weird
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:10.700]   And by the way spoiler alert apple bought beats. Okay. We're moving on now
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:16.380]   Let's uh take a break when we come back our tips our number actually each before I do that any other stories
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:22.700]   There were a lot and we didn't get to cover all of them, but uh, I know jina wants to uh get out of here and
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:28.220]   I've been I've been combing through the true crypt source here, uh, which has been very depressing
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:32.060]   I think this is almost I'm gonna absolutely say it's a hack
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:36.060]   Uh, there's just no way this would be how it ends for true crypt
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:38.620]   um and uh
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:43.260]   Uh the fact that it's signed with the hash that works just just means it was a deep hack
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:49.580]   Um, yeah, I mean that certainly the latest commit. I mean the source the source code was changed
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:56.060]   I mean there's just a bunch of a board process in secure app. Absolutely do not download right that
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:02.060]   Yeah, it's a lone exe file as we know true crypt works across many platforms including of course linux
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:06.140]   And mac and tush. So the fact that I think there's something bad happened here
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:10.620]   Uh, it could be just a could just be one of the one of the
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:19.020]   I don't know what the committer rules are for uh, for this project, but presumably there are a few trusted committers if one of them went rogue
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:24.060]   That's usually the case, right? But there's a couple of good trusted committers. Yeah. Yeah
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:28.380]   What's weird is we're not hearing from anybody about this in effect
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:36.300]   Uh the guy who uh, he's a cryptographer at john's hopkins has been tweeting about it. He says he's immediately contacted
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:39.820]   Uh the developers of true crypt and has not heard back from them
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.380]   So there's a mystery here
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:48.140]   And uh, we'll continue to cover that very strange if you go to terry's trange really weird saying
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:56.540]   And uh here is a picture by the way. Uh now crossing the twitter of dre and iovine, uh riding the
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:00.060]   Uh one infinite loop elevator with tim cookin eddy q
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:04.220]   So there's some happy people and wraps first billionaire
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:11.500]   Uh dre has a quarter of beats and so that means uh, he's just got 750 million dollars
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.860]   It's good to work if you can get it nice work if you can get it
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:23.100]   Um, wow, but is he a billionaire does well. He already have yeah, he has several hundred million. Okay. Oh ready. There you go
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:28.140]   Yeah, all right. He was it was tyreese. It wasn't him who said that but I think it's probably pretty close
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:33.980]   And by the way, he doesn't get all 750 million route away because there's 400 million in unvested stock
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:40.540]   They'll get after sitting in a few board meetings. I just can't imagine him as a full-time employee
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:46.780]   He's gonna at some point because he it's been fun, but I get back in the studio. Don't you think?
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:50.620]   Yeah, does that those seem what I mean less range
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:56.620]   You know, what's he he's gonna be eating in the cafeteria and you know, no, I love this the chat room says notice
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:59.260]   Tim cook covering his wrist
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:02.140]   Huh?
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.860]   Technology and where is eddy q's right hand?
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:15.260]   Oh mallek just tweeted google has cars without drivers apple has beats by dre
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:23.420]   I don't know what it means, but there you go. That's that's today's show in a in a headline
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:27.820]   Oh must be watching
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:33.900]   Uh, and what is what is what is dre have on his wrist? It's a nice watch, but it's not a I watch I guarantee you

[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:42.940]   They would have taken their watches off. Yeah
[01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:45.660]   They're not gonna be photographed, especially Tim
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:51.420]   Yeah, you're right. There's all there already all kinds of things flying around little tidbits around this this announcement
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:56.140]   one of them is that the official title of iovine and dray are
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:59.020]   iovine's title is going to be jimmy
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:07.180]   And dr. Dre's title is going to be dray. Yeah, that's that's their official title. Is that a joke or is that true?
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:13.660]   I think i'm seen. Yeah, exactly. What are they gonna be director of engineering and director? I mean, what are they gonna call them? Yeah

[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:52.540]   Gina trapani time for your tip of the week
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:56.940]   Android now has touchless reminders
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:24:03.980]   So when you activate voice and you say okay google, you know remind me to feed the dog at 4 p.m
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:07.500]   You can now say you know google kind of pops up a
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:13.660]   A confirmation box that you can you can tap and say yes remind me well now you can just say yes
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:18.540]   And the reminder will be set so fewer taps you can control completely by voice
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:24.060]   And this I guess was kind of a silent rollout but is is working for uh should be working for most users now
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:31.020]   I just love google now gets better all the time all the time and I just got the new google plus
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:36.700]   App on android. That's amazing. Isn't it? Yeah, it's beautiful. It took me a little while
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:39.420]   Used to it. I couldn't figure out how to use it
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:42.380]   Like how to get to photos
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:44.780]   If I know they kind of they wrote
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:49.500]   Change things around and you know what no more hamburger and I think that the hamburger is now deprecated
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:55.100]   Like the hamburgers on its way out. Yeah, I keep seeing designers say oh, no don't don't ever use a hamburger
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:59.820]   Nobody knows what it means. That's nobody even knows when we mean when we say hamburger. Yeah, you taught me
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:03.580]   It's or the base makes those the lines where you slide
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:08.780]   Yeah, facebook uses it still on there app, but it's truly uh on its way out there too
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:12.620]   And man those photo stories are amazing. I really love the one that you posted Leo
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:16.220]   Yeah, it came out really nice. Thank you google
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:21.500]   I know I know I know google's gonna take over the world and we're gonna be really sorry
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.540]   But I for one am welcoming our new over here. I just love them
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.500]   Yep
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:31.180]   I just can't get enough google and by the way the performance of this app is really good too the new google plus
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:35.340]   Android yeah the google plus app for android much better than the old app. It's gorgeous
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:38.380]   um
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:43.180]   And because of google now, I know know that the giants are five innings into a no-hitter with the cubs
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.140]   So there there's that
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.940]   Nice
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:55.180]   What do you want to share with us my normal app you got an app all right you have an app google
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:58.460]   Within the last hour updated its google camera app
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:04.540]   And has a bunch of new feature for android the google camera app for android. Okay. Uh, it's available now in google play store
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.300]   It has a new fish eye lens mode, which is really cool
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:12.860]   Cool. Yeah, you can set a timer now. They used to have a timer function
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:16.940]   I believe they took it out now they put it back in so you can say you know in 30 seconds take a picture or whatever
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:19.900]   Uh, it's actually a three second or a 10 second not 30
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:23.740]   Uh delay so that you can get into the group shot or whatever
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:30.140]   Um, and again that that was used to exist you can also capture landscape scenes with your left hand
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:36.140]   So and you can choose between 16 by 9 or 4.3 aspect ratios
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:41.260]   Um, and there's a new creative panorama mode of wide ankle and fisheye
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:44.300]   So the fisheye mode actually simulates a fisheye lens
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:50.140]   So this is a variant of like a photosphere where you essentially end up with a circle rather than a 360 degree thing
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:54.220]   That has to be viewed in a special mode. So it's really a kind of a nice
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:57.420]   Update if you're already using google camera, of course, it'll
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:00.380]   Um, you know, you'll be using it anyway, but if you're not using it
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.780]   You might want to give this a try because it looks really cool
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:06.780]   It's already a great little app and it looks even better with a few unique features
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.740]   Very cool
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:14.140]   The thing I liked about the google camera app is that it was a lot simpler than the built-in android camera
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:18.140]   So I hope that all these new features they're adding doesn't turn into that like halo
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:23.100]   Menu effect where you're like sliding up and down, you know huge hierarchy of menus
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:26.220]   Uh, but those cool days. This sound like really cool new features. I'm excited
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:30.060]   I guess we'll get that soon. I mean, I don't think I have it yet
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:36.620]   Yeah, they announced it around two o'clock. Oh specific. Okay, 44 minutes ago
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.180]   Yeah, I should have gotten the change log. I'm glad you got the mic
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.500]   You couldn't have gotten it. You just announced it
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:48.220]   Um, I got a couple of kickstarter or actually crowd sourced projects to talk about everybody's been saying you got to talk about love r
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:53.820]   Burton's kickstarter project to bring back reading rainbow. I did not grow up with reading rainbow
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:59.900]   You did not grow up. Maybe jina did chad deflow she didn't grow up. Yeah. Yeah, it's ch
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.900]   Chads
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.020]   Go
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.620]   Anyway, oh dear
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:11.420]   It was a it was a pbs program that was very beloved lvar Burton taught a lot of kids to read he said you know what
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:17.020]   Millions of kids in the united states are still illiterate one out of every four children
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:20.700]   In america will grow up illiterate. That is just
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.700]   wrong
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:26.220]   uh reading rainbow was 1983 to 2006
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:32.460]   26 emmy's a p body award, but pbs canceled it in 2006
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:37.580]   He wants to bring it back. He did bring back the reading rainbow app. We've we've we talked about that
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.700]   But he says it's not going to be tv anymore
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:42.460]   so um
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.180]   What he wants to do is reading rainbow in the classroom
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:51.660]   He wants to raise a million dollars to do that and lo and behold. I mean they just started this today
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:57.180]   I think it's already the three quarters of a million dollars and going up fast. They'll reach their goal in minutes
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:02.860]   That's great. Yeah, six for him good for him. Yeah, and if we can help put that over. I would love to be that
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:04.940]   You know, let's try to get lvar
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:10.540]   I'll call bret because I bet we can live our internet triangulation. Yeah, get him on and talk about that
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:13.740]   We've talked to him before he's just he's a great guy
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:18.460]   Uh, the other one is uh something that jeff jarvis asked us to talk about his friend bill gross
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:23.740]   He's been on the show has a new affordable 3d printer on indy gogo
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:26.380]   the matter mod t
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:34.060]   A 3d printer that would go for just around 250 bucks. That is an elegant piece of kit right there
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:37.660]   Amazing this thing looks really really cool. Isn't that neat?
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:41.260]   And it's not only that it's a 3d printer that's really affordable
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:46.140]   But they want to make transmitting designs as easy as installing, you know an app on your phone
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:52.220]   Wow, it's like an apple product. Yeah, so i can send you a really cool coat hanger
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:57.820]   You know just as easy as sending you an sms and you can just print it out right there on your desk and like you got it
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:00.460]   And it's teleportation, you know, really kind of in a way
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:06.940]   Um, and uh, yeah, I mean, you know, look I I love maker bot and and and um, you know, like I I mean
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:10.780]   I love printing but this this one seems like it's really kind of even within range of a
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:16.220]   Kind of a normal person and if and if a lot of people have these then sending designs and making designs
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:21.900]   I think it'll just be a lot more prevalent. Um, this is a really cool project. It's a pla printer. It would
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:25.820]   be able to print objects at six by four by five inches
[01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:31.500]   Frog design designed and you will I believe this if you look at it designed the printer itself
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:34.140]   Beautiful plexi case and so forth
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:40.860]   So I just wanted people to go or to know about it and to visit indigo go they're trying to raise 375,000
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:46.460]   Uh, they're more than halfway there 35 days left. The campaign started today
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:51.420]   So this is another one where people are just going crazy for it. That's crowdsourcing is just
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:58.780]   It's great. Incredible. Uh, if you search indigo go for m o d dash t. That's the name of it the mod
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:00.940]   t
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:04.140]   printer that will now be able to teleport coat hangers
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.940]   Thanks to jina trapani
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.100]   I'd like to send you a coat hanger not wire
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:11.740]   Not wire pla

[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:41.020]   redesigning it so that it is just

[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.700]   Twitter analysis tool ever
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.260]   I wish there were some way to get google plus into this
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:20.460]   Yeah, we're working on that we're working on that instagram google plus four square. Yep. Yep. It's not easy though with google plus is it
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:24.940]   They don't make it easy. No, there is a read api. So I guess you could read it, right?
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:31.580]   Yeah, yeah, we can we can read it we can get comments and stuff that their api is not as flushed out as as twitter's and facebook's but um,
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:36.860]   But yeah, we're still working on it. You can only also only get public shares, right? So that's less than half of it
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:38.780]   That's right
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:41.580]   That's right. Yeah, well, that's really less than half is yeah
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:47.260]   It's public that's what they've said in the past and you know, I we talked a couple of weeks ago with when kevin marks was here
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:52.620]   You know, he's big on the indy web project and we talked about this new with the known used to be IDNO
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:59.660]   The publishing platform the design of which is you publish to your web your blog
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:02.780]   And then it publishes it out to four square facebook and twitter
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:06.060]   But of course it can't do it to google plus because there's no right api
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:11.260]   And Ben word melon said he sent me up. So i'm gonna have my i'm gonna move my blog to that
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:16.620]   Soon, but I you know we get I wish we could do this with google plus two anyway think up
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:19.180]   Dot com. These are the insights
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:25.260]   Leo the port really inspired conversation replies outnumbered retweets
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:28.300]   Leo the port has a real potty mouth. Yes
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:31.420]   25 times a day you
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:35.420]   You still have uh, oh, this is facebook. This is fixed now two weeks
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:42.540]   We gotta fix that data there leo sorry about that one chart. Yeah, that on the right
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:49.820]   The right three right points are correct. This is the ones on the left that are correct. I suddenly had a great week
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:54.540]   Seven fourteen thousand friends a week i'm gaining
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:57.900]   We switch from tracking friends to tracking followers
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:02.220]   And so that's the I apologize that is a bug and which i don't care
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:05.340]   I have a lot of followers not so very many friends
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:09.980]   Not so very many we're still in beta and we're making lots of improvements
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:11.580]   We're launching new insights every week
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.740]   And we're gonna have a free trial soon
[01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:18.300]   So if you're not quite sure if it's right for you soon in the next cut next few weeks a lot of free trials

[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:29.260]   67 percent of my tweets last week had I me mine and myself
[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:31.980]   Fifty two points
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:36.460]   Only I don't talk about myself, but I just felt like I had to this week. It's all about me
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:41.500]   Had to share it's all about you leo. That's a good thing. Own it. No, I don't know. No judgment
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:45.500]   No judgment. I don't I don't think about that. I only tweeted seven times last week. It's not a fair
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:48.140]   Stacked. Yeah, no, that's true. That's true
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:55.180]   Uh, okay. You wanted it. I'm gonna do it. I was wrong about beats. Okay. You're happy now. You're happy now
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:58.220]   We played the video
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:04.620]   Uh, I why did we record that because I knew there was a pretty good chance I would be wrong about beats
[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:11.340]   But uh, I wanted I wanted to be wrong about it. It would have been glorious if you'd been right because everybody said it was gonna happen

[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:46.780]   And of course the best way to do it was to get one of those great twit apps on the iphone on the android
