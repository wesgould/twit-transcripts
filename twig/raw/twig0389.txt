[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   It's time for Twig this week in Google's Stacey, Jeff and Matthew Ingram are all here.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.200]   We're going to lead off with a discussion of our new chairman of the FCC.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.040]   Will he run rough shot over net neutrality?
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.160]   I'm not so sure.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.760]   That and a lot more coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.720]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google will show where we cover the latest news from the Googleverse, the internet, and life.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.320]   Joining us at his own peril, Matthew Ingram, who is on death's door, at least he sounds that way from Fort Tack.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   No, not at all.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   But you're feeling fine. You just sound like you're... you sound like you aged 20 years.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.320]   Our friends to the North are suffering from a very cold winter this year.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   Cold and damp, right?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   Yeah, it actually hasn't been that bad, but this flu has been going around. It's really, really bad.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.320]   Yeah, it's a nasty flu.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   Also, Jeff Jarvis, he's back from Davos. He's not in Japan.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   No, he's in the hospital. He's fine.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   He's fed his affairs.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.320]   And here he is.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.320]   I should learn on Facebook when you say, "Oh, yeah, I was in the hospital because it was a long time ago.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   It's fine. The outpouring is wonderful."
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   But it's like, "I'm not dying. It's okay. I just want you to know what's going on."
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.320]   Well, you know, when you get to a certain age with Jeff and I are at,
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   and you start seeing people pass away younger than you,
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.320]   you start to realize that
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   this isn't going to go on forever.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.320]   Nope.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   Feels like it should.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   Donald Trump gave him a fib.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   That's the story.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.320]   And he's sticking to it.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.320]   Also, here from Austin, Texas, she's the queen of IOT,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.320]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   Stacey on IOT.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   Hi, Stacey. Look at that smile. See, everything's better when Stacey's here.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   I don't know. You just called me bitter. So I feel like, "Oh, bitter."
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   Well, I meant Stacey's finally, let's say
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   the bloom is off the rose for Stacey and she.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   I don't think you should say that. I think that means you're old, doesn't it?
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   No, no, I meant we're the rose. The blue is off the rose from your point of view.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   You finally sent through what you thought was a distinguished
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   panel of experts talking about the weeks.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.320]   You realize, no, that's not what this show is about at all.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   I got to say the actions, but I kind of like how
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.320]   given through the marshals we can, they had said some of the certain princess Leia look.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   They're good. She's the king of our fish.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   These are my old princess Leia headsets.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.320]   Yeah, they're great.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.320]   Those are nice looking, actually.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.320]   They are lovely. They're lovely.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   I loved that you could see pictures of Princess Leia throughout the March.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   I loved that too.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   I'm kind of sad. I would love one of those posters.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   What was she doing?
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.320]   Something for resistance.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.320]   I guess it was a light. Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   Most of them said a woman's place is in the resistance.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.320]   That's what it was.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.320]   The resistance, yeah, of course.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.320]   Just don't forget what happened to the freedom fighters in the resistance.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   We suffered extreme losses to get us those Death Star plans.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   So two words.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   We'll start the show with Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the FCC.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   He is at...
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   Okay, I'm going to say there's many good things about Ajit Pai.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   For one thing, unlike a number of other appointees by our new president,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   he has some experience in the FCC.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.320]   In fact, he is a commissioner and has been appointed by Barack Obama in 2012.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:22.320]   He is elevated to chairman for one thing because he's a Republican member of the FCC commission,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   but he also doesn't have to be approved, at least until later this year,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.320]   when his term would normally run out.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   So somebody can jump right in.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   Now, I think maybe somewhat unfairly, he's been painted as a virulent net neutrality hater.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   Why do you think that's unfair?
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   He's actively stated in...
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.320]   You said it.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.320]   Well, I would...
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.320]   Yes, I think that that's not fair.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   I think...
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.320]   You know, I'm doing a beast.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   Hate net neutrality.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   Yeah, well, that's the day he'd be saying that.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.320]   But he's...
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   But he's...
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.320]   Right here.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.320]   I've covered the net neutrality debates since before he was a commissioner.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.320]   So, but once he became a commissioner in 2012, I read his opinions on all of the net neutrality
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.320]   hearings.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   He is very much against net neutrality.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   He's very much against any regulation.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   He's against...
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   Does this make him...
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   He's against something that many people, including John Perry Barlow and members of the board of the EFF
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   were against, which is too much government intervention in the internet.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.320]   Okay, but that...
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   Well, I would say he is against the chews of Title II of the Telecommunications Act to enforce net neutrality.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   I wouldn't say he's against net neutrality in general.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.320]   He is very much in free marketeer.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   He's a former Verizon telecom lawyer.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   And I know that coming after everyone was like, "Tom Wheeler was a former cable lobbyist and wireless lobbyist."
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.320]   But in his opinions, he makes no secret of the fact that he doesn't think that the government
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   should mess with any sort of discrimination on pipes at all.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   Like if you read his opinions, that is straight up what he said.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   I'm going to tell you a few things that I think are very good about him.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   But let me read this quote to him from 2014 before he was being considered as the chairman, obviously.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   This is when he was a commissioner.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   And this is when the debate began on net neutrality.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   We should not let that debate obscure some important common ground, namely a bipartisan consensus
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   in favor of a free and open internet, the freedom to access lawful content, the freedom to use applications,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   the freedom to attach personal devices to the network, the freedom to obtain service plan information.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.320]   Respect for these four internet freedoms has aided the internet's tremendous growth over the years.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   It's shielded online competitors from anti-competitive practices.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   He said many times, "I don't think it's okay for an internet service provider to slow anybody down."
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   He's dead set against that.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   I think that it's -- this is, by the way, I should point out from a Forbes article saying,
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.320]   "Why is the media smearing new FCC chair, Ajit Pai, as the enemy of net neutrality?"
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   And Forbes has a particular angle on this.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   I do think it's safe to say he's against government regulation of the internet.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.320]   He wants to take a lead round of Georgia.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   Leo, he said it's a solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   I don't see how --
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.320]   He's not alone in thinking that.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   There are a lot of people who say that -- I think he's particularly talking about Title II,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   that the decision to regulate --
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   Okay.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   We went with Title II.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   Wait, here we go, though.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.320]   Let's -- because if this is your little glitch here, Title II, the FCC actually originally,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.320]   when they were doing this, they didn't want to go Title II.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.320]   The very first net neutrality.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   And they had no legal justification for not.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.320]   In fact, the judge said, "You can't do that.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   The FCC can only do it Congress mandates."
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   Okay.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.320]   So, there's two things here.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:07.320]   Way back in the day when Genik Hausky was doing his 2010 -- I think it was 2010, but it might have been 2011 net neutrality plan,
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   the original net neutrality plan.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   That got kicked back because they didn't have that justification, congressional justification.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   But that judge did say it kind of opened the door to doing Title II.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   The judge gave them a way.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.320]   He said, "Well, if you were to use Title II -- we had this -- this is your new to this.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.320]   We've had this long conversation about this many, many times."
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   The judge was very clear that you could -- the FCC did not have a legal mandate to do it the way that Genik Hausky wanted to do it.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   Right.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.320]   And so, if you were to choose Title II of the Telecommunications Act, what you have to understand is the FCC can't do anything
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.320]   without a direct congressional mandate.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.320]   So, they need to find -- in the code --
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.320]   Right.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   -- they need to have direct justification for them regulating it.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   Many people -- many people said Title II was a very bad choice because it turns telecommunications providers into
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   regulated utilities, and it means that the FCC could even do things like set prices.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   It would over-arching.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   The FCC said, "We would never do that."
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   Right.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   They have, though.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   Can I point out that they have?
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   Oh, are we going to talk about information and privacy?
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   They have -- well, there's a few things.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   But the data regulations?
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.320]   They have also attempted to set prices on the Internet.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.320]   And I think that --
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   Where are you?
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   Which has been to this?
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   Which reasonable people can argue over -- look, the general idea --
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.320]   I'm going to shut up because I'm overdoing this.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.320]   But the general idea of net neutrality -- we can all agree bits as bits.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.320]   The Internet should be a level playing field.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:50.320]   I, of all people, should agree that because if suddenly Netflix and every technology streaming service is
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   favored over-tweet, I lose.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:59.320]   So -- and if a-tweet is favored over the next guy coming down the line, he loses.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   So, if you want innovation, you need to free an open Internet.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   We all agree on that.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.320]   Where there -- where reasonable people can disagree is how much the government should get involved in that.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   Because as soon as you turn on Title II, a government can then start to do things that we definitely don't want it to do.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.320]   So, I agree we need to take a weed-wack of FCC regulations.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   We wouldn't be in this position.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   We would have true competition if the FCC hadn't created Duapley's.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   Okay, so the FCC didn't -- he's saying there's no problem.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.320]   That's the part of that quote that I think's important, where he says it's a --
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   Well, he said, show me where -- show me where there's been damaged on.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.320]   Right, he's saying there is no problem.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   So, whether it's Title II or anything else, he doesn't believe there's a problem that needs solving.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.320]   And that was an issue all the way back in 2008.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.320]   That's been a talking point for people who are against net neutrality for a while, which is --
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   there's no problem, show it to me, but you can't really prove it.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   But going back to your point, and I'll stop after this, Leo, but I do want to say that they chose Title II
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   because they had no other option unless we were going to do a rewrite of the Telecommunications Act.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.320]   And that wasn't going to happen.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   And they decided, like any government, they have to compromise to go the route of Title II and then to forbear on a lot of these issues.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   I haven't seen them do price setting, so I'm not sure there.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   But what I will say is going forward.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   I think the real question we should be asking, because I do think he's going to dismantle some of this,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   is how he's going to do it.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   And that's actually -- I'm surprised that no one is focused on this yet because the way that net neutrality was written
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   and given the court case, I don't really know if he can just rip up the Title II aspects of it.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   I think what's going to happen is a more selective case by case -- or a decision to not take on cases and complaints
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   about things like zero rating and data caps, et cetera.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   So I don't actually think that net neutrality in Title II might be in as much danger as we're kind of all going,
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   "Ah!" So, okay.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   That was it.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.320]   Go ahead, Matt.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   Matt.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.320]   Yeah, no, I agree with Stacy.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   Okay.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   That was --
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   [laughter]
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   And I think that Forbes article was deliberately trying to make Pye's views look less critical than they are.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:35.320]   I think he's made it clear a number of times that he's not in favor of the fundamentals of net neutrality or Title II.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.320]   And don't we know that Trump is against net neutrality? He's been clear about that.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   And Ajapai says the only reason that the Democrats voted for net neutrality was because Obama made them.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.320]   My opinion is that Title II is the wrong approach to net neutrality.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:14:04.320]   I understand that was the only approach available, but I think the thing that we really have to understand is the FCC can only do what Congress specifically mandates it to do.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   And I think people don't understand the FCC is kind of an unusual beast.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:18.320]   It is really an enforcement arm for telecommunications policy as Congress specifies it.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:28.320]   I think bending the Telecommunications Act of 1986 and Title II of it to give -- to say, "Well, okay, we're going to use this, but we're not going to use that part of it.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.320]   We're not going to use that part of it."
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   It is clearly not desirable.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   It was all they had.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.320]   I would much prefer to see Congress weigh in on this and say, "This is what we want."
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.320]   So, okay.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   Be careful when you wish.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.320]   There have actually been debates.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.320]   Should we rewrite the Telecommunications Act in its 1996?
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.320]   You don't even need to do that.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   Actually, Congress could simply say, among the FCC's powers is the power to make sure that net neutrality is enforced.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   You don't need to rewrite the Telecommunications Act.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.320]   No, you can't because, "My God, remember net neutrality.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   Then we've got to argue, what is net neutrality?
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.320]   What does discrimination mean?
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   What does it constitute?"
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   Oh, my God.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   That's not going to happen.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.320]   And have you ever met Congress and have them say, "Oh, yeah, we're just going to do a tiny little addendum to this one matter."
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   I would point out that if our elected representatives don't wish to enact that, then the last thing we would want is
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:35.320]   for an overreaching federal regulatory agency to freelance.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.320]   I don't think so.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:43.320]   So, if we're in a climate where the Congress doesn't vote for this, we can yell and scream all we want.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.320]   But that's, but they've spoken.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   I don't want to see any agency.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   It's a double-edged sword.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   The minute you start saying, "Well, they should freelance," or they should take this ability written into an act that wasn't intended for that use
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.320]   for this use, you are really opening the door to some very nasty stuff.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.320]   And I think at this time, it'd probably be a bad idea to do that.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   I think we're already there.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.320]   I think the FCC did what it could.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:17.320]   And I do think the president picked Tom Wheeler based on how he knew that he would perform.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   The president performed.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   And if you mean Obama, President Obama picked Edgyt Pai.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   Okay, President Obama chose Tom Wheeler to be the chair of the FCC.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:34.320]   And by the way, what we don't know is, because remember how we felt about Tom Wheeler.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.320]   I know.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.320]   Right up to the moment.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   I know.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.320]   He changed his mind.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:48.320]   So, I would submit that we should baby be a little slow to condemn Edyt Pai until he actually has a much better history of public service than Tom Wheeler ever had.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:55.320]   He only worked for Verizon briefly in his earliest years for two years as an early lawyer.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:02.320]   I think Edgyt Pai's point is well taken, which is the best way to solve this is not with government regulation, but with true competition.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.320]   And he has some really good points.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:15.320]   One of the things he wants to do, he says, whenever we go up in utility lines, we want to make it a requirement that the utilities put in conduit up there for Internet access.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   I think he believes that the best thing to do is to open up competition.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.320]   And I think that I don't, I think everybody agrees.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.320]   That's the best way to do this.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.320]   If we can truly get there.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   Right.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.320]   Do you think we could, here's a guy who says that's where he wants to go.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:38.320]   So, Wheeler has actually talked about putting, you know, giving people right away on power lines and placing conduit.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.320]   That is not a new idea.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:49.320]   The challenge there is we can't ignore the fact that the market has been tampered with.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:55.320]   I don't know how to say it, not, it's not tampered, but the market has evolved in an unjust way or an oligopoly.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   We do not have free choice.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.320]   There is no free market Internet access in the United States.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   And so absent, absent competition, that is what the FCC has been trying to address in.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320]   To protect the pie.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   What if instead of regulating, Adjut Pyg and the FCC moved to create competition?
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.320]   We have tried that and tried that.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.320]   That's how we got here in the first place.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.320]   How have we tried that?
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:29.320]   The effort to create facilities-based competition is what led us all the way back in 1996 to cable companies and DSL providers being our only options in most places.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:38.320]   That was a decision by the US government not to put fiber into say, "Hey, these two guys, they'll be totally fine competing against each other and all our policies come that way."
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   It was the FCC that said to phone companies, "You have to open your physical plants to multiple Internet service providers and said at the same time to cable companies you do not."
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.320]   It would be a simple enough.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   In fact, I think a much more effective way to create net neutrality for them to go to cable companies and say, "Alright, time to open your physical plants to competition."
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:05.320]   Then you'd have two fat pipes into your house and many ways, many different Internet service providers to choose from.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   I would prefer that to-
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.320]   Isn't that interfering with the market?
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.320]   No, that's promoting the free market.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   They own the pipe-
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.320]   They own the pipe-
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   They are invested in this.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   Well, but-
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   That's-
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   Do you think-
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   What if he did that?
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.320]   Would you then say, "Okay, you're right. We shouldn't have net."
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   Title II was a bad idea.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.320]   Let's have a competition.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   It's hard to see how he did that when he-
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   If we have-
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.320]   He opposes regulation and opposes government-
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   Well, you're-
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   We're guessing.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.320]   Yeah, we are.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.320]   We are.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   He says he's committed to-
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   Yeah, the free and open internet.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   The B.T. model, the B.T. model, would be beneficial.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   Here's the pipe and-
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   And same as my power line now.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320]   I'm just pointing out-
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   I'm just pointing out-
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   Anybody.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:50.320]   That a lot of people who are staunch defenders of the Internet were very nervous about any government regulation at all.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.320]   There was a massive debate within the board of the EFF about whether Title II should be invoked.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   That was not a clear decision.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:03.320]   John Perry Barlow himself told me we've had big fights over this.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   We do not like calling on the federal government to regulate the Internet in any form.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   And I would submit-
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   We should have learned our lesson because many of the things that we were happy when Obama said,
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   "Oh, let's extend the power of the executive."
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.320]   We were happy when it was Obama, and now we're going, "Oh, maybe that wasn't such a good idea."
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   I agree with Stacey.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.320]   Okay.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   This is being done in lieu of competition.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.320]   But you know what?
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.320]   But we don't know.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   We will see.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.320]   And that is the beauty of it.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.320]   I will just- I will just- I think there's- Look, let me put it this way.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   There's plenty of things that are actually happening that you can complain about.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.320]   And when these things actually happen, I think the Internet will stand up just as we have in the past
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   with the Internet Blackouts and other things which we participated in.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:02.320]   And we will be sending a very clear message just as, you know, on Saturday, a million and a half women
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   and men supporting them did.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.320]   More than a million and a half.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   In Washington, it was what?
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   How many?
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320]   Three million?
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.320]   Not that we want to complain about numbers here.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   That's true.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.320]   Well, that's the answer.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   And see, that's kind of my point is that we got to be careful about what battles we choose to fight.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   But what do we do when I'm sure you're right?
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.320]   What do we do when something is zero rating?
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   How do you fix- Zero rating is a tough one.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.320]   I hate zero rating.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   It is anti-net neutrality.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.320]   Good luck in explaining that to a normal person.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.320]   So you're going to have a mark about zero rating?
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   Right.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.320]   No one will come.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.320]   So write your member of Congress.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.320]   Right.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.120]   When it came to things like zero rating, when we were talking, like his opinions on the
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   original net neutrality for wireless plans, if you go back and read them and I should
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.820]   have them right here, I could find.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.320]   He was not a fan.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:04.560]   He and O'Reilly were some of the reasons that that got dropped.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.800]   That wasn't going to fly in the FCC.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.640]   So, you know, if you're really worried about those things, you may want to keep an eye on
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   pie.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.680]   He's probably just not going to litigate it.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.800]   That's my guess, not litigate file complaints in central companies.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.400]   So anyway.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.640]   So they got to do whatever they want.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.200]   Well, I think the first thing he'll do, but we don't know.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:31.320]   This is, again, speculation is retract whatever order it was that said we're going to use
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.320]   Title II.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.240]   He can't retract that.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.200]   That's been in the federal register.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.760]   It's published in the federal register.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.280]   Yes, he couldn't reverse it.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:46.360]   They would have to, they would have to file a notice of proposed rulemaking.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.400]   So we'll have plenty of interesting when, you know, this stuff happens.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.160]   And to me, while there's a lot of stuff, I don't think he seems, I guess what I'm saying
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.360]   is he's not on the fringe.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.560]   He is well within the universe of responses that even strong defenders of the Internet.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.200]   Yes, yes, he is.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.280]   And he's technically savvy.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.280]   This is not like rip-air.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.280]   And he's not making no noise.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.280]   What he's doing.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.280]   He comes from this business.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.280]   You know, you're right.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   He does have a good track record.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:19.840]   I think he's one of the Trump nominees that really has some experience in this matter.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.840]   He is very smart.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.880]   He's very erudite when it comes to things like spectrum.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:31.280]   You know, like, in many ways, this is a true just policy disagreement as opposed to like,
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.360]   a what is happening in this world kind of commentary.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.640]   So in many ways, that's kind of refreshing.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:43.880]   His opinion was that the FCC didn't even have that authority that you can title to was really
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.480]   not quite legal.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.120]   So and I don't disagree with that point of view.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.360]   I think that was a risky thing to do.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.080]   Although I supported it at the time.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.240]   It did seem like the only reasonable way to get net neutrality in force.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.560]   So then the question is, if he's in favor of competition, how's he going to encourage
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   that?
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.560]   That's right.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   That's right.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.600]   And that's what I think we should do is encourage that because that would be the best solution
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   would it not?
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   Right.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.200]   But he's not going to be the guy who he is.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   Let me put it this way.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:20.360]   He is likely not going to be the guy who complains that FC or complains that AT&T is using its
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.000]   direct TV.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.920]   You know, it's not counting direct TV data against their customers.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.080]   We thought Tom Wheeler wouldn't be the guy either.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.920]   So let's let's wait.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.760]   The other thing that's happened is that is that in this period Verizon stop building,
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.320]   Google stop building.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.320]   Where's the competition?
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.720]   Where's the investment going to come from?
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   Right.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.520]   Well, he would argue the reason they stopped building is because they were told that they
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   couldn't compete.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.480]   But with the FCC was going to regulate them.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.560]   They said that's exactly what AT&T said.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.280]   They said, well, he was going to say a bad word.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.920]   Well, but that was AT&T's justification, whether you believe it or not.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   Right.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.920]   AT&T.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.920]   Come on.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   Google didn't make a difference.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.920]   Okay.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.920]   So really, okay.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:09.240]   What's really coming down to is your your attitude towards how corporate America thinks
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.440]   about this kind of stuff as opposed to any factual situation because he hasn't done.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.760]   He hasn't done anything.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.840]   So I'm just expecting the worst.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.800]   He has voted for a lot of things and voted against a lot of things.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.520]   I'm not just expecting it.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   I am basing it on a history of reading his opinions, a four year history of reading his
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   opinions.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.520]   That's not nothing Leo.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.920]   You're like, but you're right.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.960]   He hasn't done anything and, you know, we'll see.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:45.520]   I will say on the positive side, he is aware of the need for spectrum and the millimeter
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   wave bands.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:52.480]   He is actually trying to allocate advocate for more or he had been in his previous opinions.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.800]   So for things like 5G gigabit wireless services, we could actually see some more movement there
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.960]   from FCC commanded chaired by pie.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   It's it's complicated.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.360]   I'll give you an example that on the surface, you would say, oh, he's on the wrong side of
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.360]   this story.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:18.600]   The FCC vote that prevent prohibited or I said, Internet service providers have to get permission
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.920]   from you to share your data.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.280]   And he voted against that.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.520]   He said, no, no, they shouldn't.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:30.360]   However, his argument was that these new rules did not in fact stop companies from harvesting
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.440]   and monetizing your data.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.720]   And he wanted stronger rules.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:40.640]   So if you look at the top line, you'll say, oh, yeah, he voted against your privacy.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.840]   But I think it's more nuanced than that.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.360]   And everything's more nuanced than a news story.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   Right.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   So exactly.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.040]   So I think we're in a nuanced situation.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.480]   And I think this would be a good time to write your member of Congress and say, let's please
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:27:00.080]   give the SEC tools they need to promote competition among Internet service providers.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.520]   And I think that that's something everybody can get behind.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.960]   Republicans are all about free market, right?
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.480]   Question remains the words that we're going to come from.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.920]   Where is yes, I could say that everyone I talked to say competition is good.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   The question is how you can.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:20.360]   Friend Dane Jasper, who's running sonic.net, who has lots of ideas for how he can compete
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:26.840]   and is competing successfully in some markets against Comcast and your phone company.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.560]   And he's putting in fiber in a lot of markets.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.600]   One of the things Dane's really, Dane really, really wants is the right to when they go
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.560]   up and put those utility lines up, the right to access the utility lines.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:43.880]   You know who supports that strongest that more than AT&T and agit pi?
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:50.560]   This is one of his points in his plan for the future is this should be a legal requirement.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.400]   The utilities allow access to competing Internet service providers to those lines.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   And that's a great idea.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.200]   So Dane's, Dane's challenge there isn't actually the federal government.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.200]   It's the city government.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.440]   That's why he wants a federal law, which agit pi supports.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.360]   Which is really against Republican values if we think about it.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.160]   I don't know where a lot of values are.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.760]   What the hell are Republican values now?
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.760]   I don't know.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.280]   I think it's not a Republican administration.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.320]   It's a very different kind of almost a populist administration.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.560]   And I'm not sure what the rules are.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.680]   And that's why I think all we can do at this point is wait and see and prepare your ink
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.240]   and paper and get ready to write lots of letters.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.320]   And but I think it's a good thing to say what we would like.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:40.680]   And what I think I would say people who favor a free and open Internet would not like is
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:46.120]   more government regulation if we what we would prefer is more competition.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.120]   Is that wrong?
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.120]   It's not wrong.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:55.240]   But you when we call or when we write our letters, we can't just say, I like competition.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.240]   You have to give them a path forward to that because there are multiple paths forward.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.240]   Right.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.120]   Well, one of the federal law requiring that access to polls.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.160]   And that's going to come up again in the courts because that a lot of those are owned
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.720]   by utilities or there's also the local regulations.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.560]   But let's move on to a I don't disagree that there'll be a fight.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.640]   But anything you want to do is going to be a fight.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.640]   Well, true.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.200]   I mean, that's how that's how it works.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.240]   And I'm really I would also I would really point out that Congress is the people is who
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.880]   tells the FCC what to do.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.880]   It doesn't really matter what Ajit Pai wants.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.160]   Ultimately, he has to do what Congress tells it to do.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.200]   And that was where the that's why the court threw it back because they said you don't
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   have a mandate.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.160]   A congressional mandate to do this.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.520]   The closest thing you've got is title two.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   Make take a break.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   We'll come back.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:51.960]   There's lots more to talk about, including some new IoT connections, new friends, as you
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:30:01.000]   say, for Google Home, five X prize finalists, and Google voice is back, baby.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Our show.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Wow.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.800]   I got a cool off here.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.600]   You know what?
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.880]   You know, all I'm trying to do is say, instead of just doing the knee jerk, which I do to
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.720]   and say, oh, this guy's terrible is what is the what is the way forward that we want
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.640]   as advocates of a free and open internet?
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.320]   We can all agree on this.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   What is the way forward?
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320]   What is the right way?
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   That's fair.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.960]   And I don't think I don't think screaming at the choice of Ajit Pai to run the FCC, which
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.480]   is done is the way to do it.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:39.840]   Now we need to kind of encourage something that every Republican can support free and
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.680]   open competition.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.840]   That seems fair.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.320]   Matt, you're the peacemaker.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.680]   I totally agree, Leo.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.520]   We should not throw Ajit Pai under the bus.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.520]   Yeah, not yet.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.520]   We threw.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.640]   I feel bad because we threw we called Tom Wheeler a dingo.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.640]   We did.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.640]   We did.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   No.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:05.640]   And incidentally, what does the CRTC in Canada do about net neutrality?
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   Oh.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:12.360]   Yeah, there really isn't any such thing.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:19.160]   Those discussions haven't even really reached the point where, you know, to be frank, where
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:24.160]   they are in the US, there isn't even really much of a debate, which is unfortunate.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   It's my sense.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.440]   Rogers does any competitive things like throttle Skype because they want to use their voice.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.440]   Yep.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   Solution.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.080]   And many of those battles were lost years ago.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.560]   There's just been so much consolidation.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.280]   It's effectively a market duopoly in most cases.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:48.600]   So there's just no real incentive for anyone to take that issue by the horns and try and
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.280]   fix it.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:32:03.640]   I feel like at some point, we're just going to have to pick our battles and say the most
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.320]   important thing is this.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.480]   But Jesus, when you're when your feet are on fire and your hair is on fire, you decide
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.960]   which is the most important.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.200]   Well, then you pick the thing that you think you could build the strongest coal.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.280]   This is called politics.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.480]   The thing you can build the strongest coalition around of self interest because that's how
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.920]   people ultimately act that will in the long run further your goals to keep the internet
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.720]   free and open.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   That's true.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:35.400]   But I think if you look at Canada, for example, if you lose or you give up this little battle
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:41.520]   and then you give up the next little battle because you're waiting for the big one, eventually
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.760]   you've given up so much that you've effectively lost.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:52.400]   Well, it's going to be the next four years at least you're going to be going to be.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.400]   Like the Civil War, I think.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.840]   I think it's the closest analogy.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.960]   And I just don't want Richmond to get burned to the ground or something.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.600]   I don't know.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:11.080]   Are are sure they brought to you by rocket mortgage for quick and loans, geeks.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.000]   This is your chance to use the internet for something good for yourself.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.480]   Getting a home loan or a refi without all the paperwork, all the details in a way that
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:25.760]   is kind of what the internet promises was friction free and filled with choice.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.240]   The big decision of choosing a mortgage lender really comes down to a few things.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.320]   First you start with trust.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.080]   Rocket mortgage comes to you from quick and loans.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.120]   The number two lender in the country, the best lender in the country.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.400]   Also many, many JD Power Awards for customer satisfaction.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.720]   I just talked to a friend of mine, Sam, you know, I don't want to use his last name, who
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.720]   just used Rocket mortgage.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.120]   He said it was a stellar experience.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.760]   Just because you could do it all online, you could submit pay stubs, check statements,
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.840]   all the stuff that they need without with a touch of a finger on your phone, on your
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.680]   tablet, on your computer.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.640]   They have sliders that let you adjust the length of your loan, the rate in real time
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.960]   to see, you know, you can fiddle with it till you get it just the way you want it.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.760]   And approval comes through in minutes, not weeks or months.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.320]   It was months last time I got a home loan.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:17.560]   So whether you're looking to buy a home or refi, you got to lift the burden of getting
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.200]   a home loan with Rocket mortgage.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.200]   Get it.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.000]   Rocket lift off rocket.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Skip the bank.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.680]   Skip the waiting go completely online.

[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.040]   Quick and loans.com/tweag.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.320]   Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.360]   Number 30-30.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.240]   We thank Rocket mortgage by Quick and Loans for supporting this week in Google.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:45.960]   Quick and loans.com/tweag.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.960]   Hello.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.960]   Washington calling.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.720]   Sorry about that.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.360]   That's all right.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   All right.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   Stacy, you picked that one actually.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.360]   Yes.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.160]   I don't see, I don't see Adjut Pie in the rundown.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.200]   Well he's in the rundown now.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   Darn it.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.200]   Hey, you lucky.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   Hey, congratulations to Amazon getting the first Oscar nomination for a streaming service.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   You know?
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.720]   Man chose to go out and see the most depressing movie you'll see all year.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:19.160]   Actually, yeah, it's tied with Moonlight for the most depressing movie of all time.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.520]   My wife liked it, but I can't bear to see it.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.080]   I loved it and I highly recommend seeing it, but there's two things about it.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.440]   It is a little grim and yet the acting is stellar.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.280]   The writing is stellar.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.040]   The direction is stellar.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   And then there's a weird thing that I don't like, but I can't tell you.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.440]   Well I guess I could say this.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:47.160]   I don't like how it ends.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   I can't say this.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   I'm not going to keep me that hand.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.240]   Put your fingers in your ears.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.240]   It doesn't...
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   No way to have it seen it.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   It doesn't end.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   It doesn't...
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.800]   So it doesn't have an ending.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.280]   It's more a slice of life.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:02.840]   Oh, it's kind of like I shouldn't say it because people possibly didn't see the other
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.240]   movie that people are excited about.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.240]   It doesn't end.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   It doesn't end.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   I just...
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.880]   Actually, Oscar nominations are some great movies.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.220]   I don't like La La Land.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.420]   I'm just going to say it.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.420]   Heartless, cool.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.420]   I feel terrible.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.420]   The most...
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.080]   Tied for the most Oscar nominations of all time.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.080]   I didn't like it either.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.080]   I don't know.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.440]   I thought if you were going to make the musical, people should know how to sing.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.080]   They should know how to sing!
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   I just...
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.080]   Why are you guessing?
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   They were terrible.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.080]   They were terrible.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.080]   Yours.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.920]   Are you shitting just for me?
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.320]   They wrote everything right out of the Emma...
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   What's her name?
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   The female star.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.320]   Her.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   Emma Stone.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.320]   Emma Stone.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   Who is a great actress.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   She's so good in that.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.320]   Yes.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   She is.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.320]   But she's still...
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   She can't sing.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.320]   She's out of her range.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.320]   And they can't dance.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.320]   I was fine with the...
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.320]   She's so cute.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   And...
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.320]   She is cute.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.960]   For a musical, it doesn't have any catchy numbers.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   Can you...
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.960]   No catchy numbers.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.760]   And it was kind of boring.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.760]   Like...
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760]   But we know...
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.400]   We know why it got so many awards, right?
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   It's a musical.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.400]   Why?
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.400]   No, it's about Hollywood.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.400]   Oh, it's about Hollywood.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.400]   It's about Hollywood.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.200]   It's about Hollywood and it's about singing and dancing.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.040]   Like, obviously it's going to win every award that is out there.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.560]   I mean, I love musicals.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.400]   I would love to see a rebirth of the Hollywood musical, but this isn't it.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   I can't stand musicals.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.000]   This is the antithesis.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Well, you would...
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Boy, you cold-hearted...
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Have you seen the musical...
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Yeah, I like the...
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   You're the reviewer.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.120]   You're the only professional reviewer in the body.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.120]   It touched me.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   Why?
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.920]   Roshni, I can stand back and see all that.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.080]   And the end, it touched me.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.080]   You know what?
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.880]   There is a wonderful moment in it.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.560]   And if you haven't seen it, this isn't a spoiler.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:47.800]   But when Gosling and Stone Kiss, that incredible montage is amazing.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.640]   And lifts it up.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.680]   'Cause up to that point I was thinking.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.560]   I'm still mad 'cause I got sucked into going to see Into the Woods.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.840]   Nobody told me it was a musical.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.840]   Oh, you don't.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.840]   If you remember the...
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.560]   Wow, that's a great musical.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.560]   I know.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.440]   I was singing or dancing in any of the commercials.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   So I got sucked into the movies.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.440]   You know what?
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   It's so funny.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.440]   They decided not to market as a musical.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.240]   And I was watching the ads and I'm saying, "This is a Steven Sona musical.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.800]   There's no singing in the ad."
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   Exactly.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   They tricked you.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   So I thought it was just me.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   No, we know why.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   They tricked me.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   They tricked me.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   Isn't that funny for my money back?
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   I saw that.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.600]   I actually noted that 'cause I knew the show.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.720]   My kids were laughing hysterically, like halfway into the movie.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   You got dented into a musical.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.720]   Is there singing and dancing through this whole thing?
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   They're like, "Yes, Dad.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.720]   It's a musical."
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   I've done that.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.320]   I've done that to my husband.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.840]   So it's not only a musical.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   It's not fair.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.840]   It's a very musical musical.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.640]   And actually I didn't mind that one.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.640]   Don't tell my...
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.640]   You didn't mind into the woods?
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:46.080]   Yeah, I didn't mind it even though I got tricked into seeing it.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.480]   Meryl Streep's great in it.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.040]   She was great, yeah.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.960]   Anyway, Manchester by the sea.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.840]   Now, I don't know if Amazon really deserves credit for this 'cause it's my understanding.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.400]   They didn't produce it from the beginning.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.400]   They bought it.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   They just bought it at Sundance.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.400]   Right?
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   The same way they funded transparent.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.400]   They didn't really fund it.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.400]   They just...
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.760]   They funded the distribution of it.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.760]   Right.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   Right.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.760]   It was already made.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.320]   I still think it's interesting that them, like Amazon, I mean, they're willing to shell
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.360]   out some big dollars at Sundance.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.360]   I agree.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.000]   They did it last year and they're doing it this year.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.720]   Somebody was telling me that that's the new thing now.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.920]   All the streaming companies, Netflix, Amazon, go to Sundance now to try and find the next
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.920]   big hit.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   And it paid off.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.920]   And it paid off.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.520]   Yeah, there was a bidding war, I think, for Manchester by the sea.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.440]   Well, and it makes sense because they don't need to...
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.920]   I mean, these companies don't have the same agenda, really, as a paramount and, you know,
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.920]   lion's date.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.920]   Right.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   They don't have to have a blockbuster.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.920]   Exactly.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.080]   'Cause they can monetize it later in other ways.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:54.880]   And I think in particular, Amazon, they have, you know, this massive, massive business that
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.720]   has nothing to do with movies.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   And what I've been doing is, you know, I've been doing a lot of movies for her is to get
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   you to sign up for print.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.720]   Well, you know, so I was looking with the death of Mary Taylor War.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   Oh, maybe we forgot.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   It's horrible.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   Horrible.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   I see the truth of the '17s, just as bad as the '16 folks.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   Well, she was.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   I was looking back.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.720]   I mean, people do die in their 80s.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.720]   They do.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   She was 40, I would say.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   Betty White is still alive though.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   Oh, Betty White, 95 years old.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.720]   Yeah, but why are we a grudgier?
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.720]   No, no.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.720]   I'm just saying, I know this sounds heartless, but they're...
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.720]   Move on, you know, Betty.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.600]   As you get to a certain age, it starts to become expected.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.600]   I was bored with her.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.360]   Oh my God, she died.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.360]   How did that happen?
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   She had diabetes.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   She was 80.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.200]   I was actually how you feel about it in 20 years.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   I know.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   No, no, no.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   You're right.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   You're absolutely right.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   She was so young.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   She was so young.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.720]   So I was actually going somewhere with this, which was I had to review HBO when it's early
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.360]   days when the only thing they made was excuses to have women raise their tops because, hey,
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.600]   cable, we can do that.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.120]   God, yeah.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.920]   And I forget the name of it.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   They still have to use that.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.920]   I'll do my old reviews.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.920]   They still have that.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.520]   So I'll review and there was a Mary Tyler Moore movie that, to my mind, was the first
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.880]   good cable movie.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   Pay cable movie.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.880]   Don't tell us.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.880]   Don't tell us.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.880]   If you want to forget the name, no, no, no.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.880]   I got my go.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.480]   Tyler Moore cable movie wasn't the burning bed.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   That was fair of faucet.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.360]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.360]   Was she...
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.320]   Did you play a career gal, a plucky little career gal?
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   Oh, hell's that.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   I lost it.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.920]   Her son died in it.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.720]   Oh, wasn't it?
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.080]   And her son was...
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   How that?
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   Oh, oh.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.360]   Oh, chat room.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.360]   Move on, Betty.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.360]   Watch that room.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.360]   Is that...
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.360]   Oh, shoot.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.920]   I can't find it.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.880]   Oh, that move on, Betty, is to Betty White.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.520]   No, don't move on.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.520]   That's terrible.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.520]   Not ordinary people.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.520]   No, no, no.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.520]   Was it cable?
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.520]   Was it cable?
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.520]   Well, you know, I didn't begin again.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.520]   Yeah, beginning again.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.520]   Yes.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.520]   And again, beginning again.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.960]   HBO in 1985.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   Hallelujah.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.600]   I wrote "Pay Cable" has a long last made movie to love.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.320]   And it's ever to make adult movies.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.560]   Cable too often has equated mature taste with unsettled sex and violence.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.640]   Finnegan has no flush of blood instead of both only a good taste in warm and talented
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.160]   and warm, funny, or a medic tail.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.520]   Very talented, more Sam Waterston.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.840]   Is that how you found it?
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.360]   You went through your old clippings?
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.320]   No, I searched Google.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   Yeah, that would be sad.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.640]   You'd have to get out the Manila folders for that.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.960]   Look, it says, "Yeah, real winter, heartwarming and funny, Jeff Jarvis."
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.400]   Oh, no, you're kidding.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.400]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.400]   I'm joking.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.400]   All right.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:46.240]   Usually what they did was an amazingly awful movie, amazing Jeff Jarvis.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.240]   Right.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.120]   That must call.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.680]   That must call reviewers when they do that.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.600]   So when we were starting at our table weekly, I was still a TV critic of people.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:03.520]   And I complained in my column, people how an NBC pinhead had done that to her.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.040]   And the publisher of the magazine went out to have one of the first meetings with NBC
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:15.560]   and he met with the guy and the guy said, "Tell Jarvis, I'm the pinhead."
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.200]   Vine is dead, long live Vine.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:27.760]   There's an archive now online of Vine videos containing all the posts from 2013 to 2017.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.760]   That's a good way.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.360]   I think there's a creator spotlight section.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.080]   Vine's grouped by genre.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.960]   That's one way to save.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:44.040]   I can't think of another case of that happening, of an app or a service dying and being preserved
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.120]   in this way.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.120]   This is nice.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.520]   The first thing is you can still use Vine in a way.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:55.880]   It's called Vine Camera Now and you stream it straight through Twitter.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.040]   But it doesn't go up on the Vine.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.760]   It doesn't exist as a separate painting.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.000]   In a way, this is a great time capsule, isn't it?
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   It is.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   The way we're in there.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   The Internet Archive.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.720]   Remember the Internet in 2013?
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.840]   You can see the Shiba Inu dancing because he's so happy.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.360]   All those great vines.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.600]   There's President Obama with a message for the mad kid.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.600]   And the mask lady.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.600]   Right?
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.120]   Was that fun?
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.520]   That was fun.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.520]   Bad dad is the best.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.520]   You just grow a pattern.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.520]   Bad dad.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   I love bad dad.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.520]   He's fantastic.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.520]   Ken.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:34.160]   Save Vine was a good thing.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.160]   It was great.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.480]   Because he only had six seconds.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480]   You had to really...
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.480]   Well, it wasn't fun.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   It wasn't fun.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   It wasn't fun.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   Who doesn't think that's fun?
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.480]   Who doesn't think that's funny?
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   That's...
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:51.720]   Actually, believe it or not, my teenage daughter became obsessed with these Vine artists who
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.280]   were doing basically pretty bits.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   She knew all their names.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   That's all she watched.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   They were celebrities.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   It was a real moment.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.480]   It only lasted for a month or two.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.920]   It was a real moment.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.640]   I really think they did not take advantage of it properly.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.040]   Which like who would have guessed, the Twitter would have a great idea.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.320]   But not sort of executed properly.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.680]   Yeah, who'd think?
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   But I think they...
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.440]   Did they build it or did they buy it?
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.440]   They bought it.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.440]   They bought it.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.880]   It's like how Yahoo and AOL ruined everything they bought.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.720]   [inaudible]
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.720]   Okay.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.080]   A lot of these were super stupid.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.080]   Super stupid.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.080]   Super stupid.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.080]   Stupid stupid stupid.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.360]   Someone said it was really funny.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.160]   This is one and taken.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.640]   Well back to the internet.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.560]   Oh, Lord.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   He Rick rolled us.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.560]   He never got to go vandalize some stuff.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.560]   Hi.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   Sure about this.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.560]   I mean, just go hurry.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.560]   [laughter]
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:58.800]   They go up and write a lot of four by four equals 60.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.960]   That's science nerds.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.960]   That's Vine right there.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.520]   Vine is still alive.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:09.320]   VineVIN.co for the archive of all of the Vine stuff and then the highlights
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   are the big Vine.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:16.040]   I think unfortunately a bunch of those stars wanted Twitter to help them.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.040]   Right.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   And wanted Twitter to do that.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.040]   They wanted a million bucks each.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.040]   They wanted YouTube bucks for make-in-vines.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.040]   Right.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:29.720]   And so unfortunately a lot of them fled for YouTube and Vimeo and there wasn't much.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.000]   Some of them should not have gone beyond the 60 seconds.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   That's the other thing.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.600]   People didn't appreciate like...
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.240]   Can I just say I hope that when Twitter goes belly up,
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.440]   in the next year or so, it will also do the same.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.440]   Well, I think they're selling it off piece by piece.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.440]   I just...
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.880]   They sold fabric to Google.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.880]   Right.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.680]   Fabric which is their mobile development platform.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.360]   Which if you remember was going to be sort of...
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.360]   That was the future growth plan was that it was going to basically integrate with all
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.120]   these mobile apps and it was going to build a platform that Twitter would be at the center
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:12.360]   of and so on, which is a great idea except now it'll be Google instead of Twitter.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:19.640]   Google I/O in an unprecedented break with tradition Google has announced Google I/O will
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:25.320]   be May 17th, 18th and 19th once again at the Shoreline Amphitheater.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.320]   Did you go, Jeff?
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.320]   Yes, I did.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.320]   Was that good?
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.320]   It worked.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.320]   It did work.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.720]   It had more room and yeah, I liked it.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.720]   I hope to go again.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.600]   Well, one where everyone was complaining about being sunburned and hot because it was outside.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.600]   Okay.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   They should do the regurgiques.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.960]   No, I mean that they got their vitamin D for probably more vitamin D than they get in
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.440]   a year.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.440]   So they've actually created...
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.600]   What do we think they're going to do this year?
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.800]   Oh, that's an interesting thing.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   We got quickly.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.080]   This is the site Google created.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:05.240]   Savethedate.foo that invited developers to solve these puzzles to come up with the
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:10.880]   date and thank goodness Venturebeat did it so I didn't have to.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.880]   Five puzzles.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.480]   F8 is April, 18, 19.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.480]   So it's one month.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.840]   Facebook is what they...
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.000]   So what is Google going to do?
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.160]   That's a good question.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.640]   They're coming up with five more chat apps, I think.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.400]   We don't have enough messaging apps.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   So...
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.720]   Well now that Aloe is taking over the world, oh, yes.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.760]   Make Aloe an SMS app and I will use it for credit.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.680]   Now somebody said, and I thought this was an interesting insight because otherwise it's
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.280]   inexplicable that it's an...
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.080]   They're worried about trust and trust.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.800]   Yeah, you said that I think last year.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.800]   And so, yeah.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   And so...
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.200]   That's the only way to explain how Google's fragmented messaging strategy makes any sense
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.200]   at all.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.160]   I don't think that makes any sense.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.160]   And it really doesn't make any sense.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.160]   So...
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.560]   As trying to be afraid of any trust.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:02.560]   So you shoot yourself in the foot or cut off one of your limbs or...
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.560]   It doesn't...
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.160]   It just makes no sense.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.000]   I don't understand it.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.800]   It's frustrating as heck though.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:15.320]   Like try and explain that to a normal person if you want them to use one of those apps.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.520]   But I thought I was using Hangouts.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.080]   Oh yeah, I forget about that.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.160]   You have to use this other thing now.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.920]   But I mean, there's just...
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.520]   There's no rhyme or reason to...
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:29.760]   Well, that's why it's interesting that Google is now adding features to voice and Google
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.260]   Hangouts.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.560]   We do products, we thought we're gone.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.080]   So voice is interesting.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.200]   And there's some speculation that by adding...
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.800]   They added MMS.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.520]   After all this time, you can now use...
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.520]   Do MMS with...
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.520]   And groups.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.520]   You can do...
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.520]   Right now.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.480]   After all this time, it's still not supporting SMS.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.840]   Exactly, I don't know.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:56.020]   But the thinking is maybe this is the beginning of kind of the transition for Hangouts completely
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.920]   to be an enterprise solution.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.540]   And then Google Voice be the messaging platform.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.900]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.740]   I don't understand.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:08.020]   All I get through Hangouts is spam.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:14.460]   How about Google I/O will they announce more Google Home stuff probably, right?
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.460]   Assistant probably.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.460]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.900]   And maybe they'll bring...
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:23.260]   So they keep talking about bringing things like the ability to control some of the things
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:27.420]   that you can do via Google Home, like your smart home stuff via Assistant.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.960]   So maybe they'll announce that.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.960]   That'd be cool.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.720]   Hey Google.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.360]   Did you fart?
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:41.160]   I put up a list of all the things you can ask Google.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.160]   What does she say?
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.160]   We didn't hear it.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.160]   What does she say?
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.160]   Oh.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.160]   Hey Google.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.160]   Turn it up.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.160]   Did you fart?
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   You can bring me a few words.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.160]   I don't mind.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.160]   You can bring me a few words.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.160]   You can bring me a few words.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   I don't mind.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.160]   You can bring me a few words.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.160]   I don't mind.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.160]   You can bring me a few words.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.160]   You can bring me a few words.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:02.260]   The entire list of things you can ask Google Home up was the last one they listed.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.980]   Please don't tell my 14-year-old about that.
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.820]   Actually be more your daughter, Stacy.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.820]   I was going to say mine would be.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.820]   She's more in the age of...
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.160]   Yeah, I think the 14-year-olds by now are like, yeah, I'm over farts.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.780]   Actually, I think my 18-year-old would think it was pretty funny.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.020]   I showed her the...
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:24.060]   Did you see the chat where the Google Home and the Echo were having a discussion together?
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:25.060]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.060]   Boy, that was mind-numbingly boring.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.360]   That was hysterical.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.660]   Parts of it were hilarious.
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.860]   It was just weird.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.260]   Yeah, that was the best part.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.780]   Hey, Google, turn the volume up.
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.020]   You can do it with your finger.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.020]   Just do it.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.020]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.020]   I can wear it.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.020]   Where are we going?
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.020]   On the top, you can see that little circle of lights and just...
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:46.020]   I got it.
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.020]   I got it.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.020]   Okay.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.020]   We're just going to...
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.020]   Both of us are just going to be doing this.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:52.020]   I'm turning it up, Stacy's turning it down.
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.020]   Thank you.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.280]   No, I'm turning it up.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.280]   You're going counterclockwise.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   That's down.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.660]   No, I'm going counterclockwise when I'm not in a screen.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.660]   Are you in reverse?
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.660]   Am I?
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.660]   Let's see.
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.660]   Do it clockwise.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:05.660]   I'm going clockwise.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:06.660]   You're going clockwise.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.660]   This is clockwise.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.660]   Okay.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.660]   Yes.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:10.660]   So you are reversed.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.660]   I'm reversed.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.860]   I'm in the reverse world, Leo.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.300]   What does it look like I'm doing?
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.300]   Zaro.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   You're doing...
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.300]   You're a counterclockwise.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.300]   So it's because...
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.300]   Yeah, I'm doing a clockwise as well.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.300]   So...
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.300]   It's because we're not a reviewer.
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:25.300]   It would be...
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.300]   Which is reversed.
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.300]   I don't want to...
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.200]   Let's review how television works.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.200]   My head hurts.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.200]   No.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.200]   Hey, Google.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.740]   The math is hard.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.740]   I am your father.
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.740]   You're a fan too, but...
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:36.740]   I'm your father.
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:37.740]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:38.740]   I'm your father.
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:39.740]   What?
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.740]   Hey, Google.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:41.740]   I am your father.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:42.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:43.740]   I'm not Luke.
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:44.740]   This is kind of awkward.
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:45.740]   Oh, the echo does that too.
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.580]   When you say that, I think she goes, "No!"
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.580]   No!
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:49.580]   No!
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:50.580]   No!
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.580]   No!
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.580]   No!
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.580]   No!
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:54.580]   No!
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:55.580]   That's funny.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.580]   That's funny.
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:57.940]   That's funny here.
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:59.900]   Hey, Google.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.220]   Set phasers to kill.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.940]   My phasers are permanently set to piece mode, Captain.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.940]   Dorky.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:07.940]   Very dorky.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.940]   That's peaky.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:09.940]   That's like...
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:10.940]   Well, not really good.
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:16.220]   So I will tell you from a practical standpoint, slightly more practical than the fart jokes,
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.220]   compared to...
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.500]   So I...
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.220]   Because I've been testing my Google Home in Echo with the new WeMo stuff, I've been
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:27.420]   doing a lot of like, "Hey, so and so, turn this light on."
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.620]   And I noticed with the Echo, you have to say, "Turn on living room lamp."
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:38.740]   With the home, Google Home, you actually can say, "Turn living room lamp on, turn on
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.140]   living room lamp."
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.380]   Is the living room lamp on?
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:42.380]   And all of that works.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.380]   Yeah, that's funny.
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.940]   It's very nice, much less rigid.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.940]   Well, that's...
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.940]   That's AI.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.940]   That's machine learning, right?
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:48.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.180]   Yeah, it's a little more sophisticated.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:55.100]   And is it Google Home or Echo where you can say computer now?
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.100]   That's Echo.
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.100]   I forgot.
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.100]   Echo has computer now.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.100]   That's the Amazon Echo.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.100]   And that's totally for Star Trek fans, right?
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.540]   There's no practical reason you should say computer.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.540]   If you're talking to a computer...
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.540]   True.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.460]   You are, yeah.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:13.140]   And you know, if your kid's name was anything related to the Echo's main name...
[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:17.900]   I interviewed on Monday, a good friend named Alex.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.700]   I noticed that he used Amazon as a keyword for his Echo.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.140]   And he said, "Well, yeah, when you're named Alex, you can't use the other one."
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.140]   Right.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.460]   Because people all the time coming over to me saying, "Hey, Alex, I'm sorry.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:29.460]   What did you want?"
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.460]   All right.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.220]   Will they talk about Google Wi-Fi?
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.380]   What is the status of...
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:37.420]   Is Wi-Fi going the way of the on hub?
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.420]   Google Wi-Fi.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:39.420]   You know, that's the...
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.420]   What does that question mean?
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.180]   Well, on hub kind of fizzled, right?
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.180]   I don't see a lot of...
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.180]   Okay.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.140]   So here's an important thing to say to people.
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:51.940]   If you have a Google on hub, it works with Google's Wi-Fi.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.740]   So those two things work together as a mesh network.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:56.980]   So we only have to spend a few hundred dollars more to make it more useful.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:00.340]   A lot of people feel like they're like, "Well, now this sucks.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.300]   I've got the on hub and it's no longer useful."
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:03.500]   It can be one of your Wi-Fi.
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.500]   Yes.
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.060]   Do they sell Google Wi-Fi in anything less than a three pack?
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:08.060]   One.
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:09.060]   I think it can buy a one.
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.060]   So you could have two?
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.060]   Yeah, you can.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.060]   If you have on hub, you could add two.
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:13.060]   Okay.
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:18.340]   So I think someone did a tear down of the on hub and there's Zigbee inside.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.340]   Right.
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.340]   Zigbee radio, which makes sense.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.340]   We did that all along.
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.340]   Did the 8/11 or .14?
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:26.100]   Is it in the Wi-Fi too, that it's in there?
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.100]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.100]   The Zigbee chips, the 8/11.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.140]   And that makes sense because thread is based on the same radio.
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:37.940]   So I think if we look at the New York Times story about AI and translate and you hear...
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:38.940]   Hold on a second.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:39.940]   I'm going to mention that.
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:46.180]   A quick note, if you do use your on hub with Google Wi-Fi, you should not trust the usage
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:50.340]   statistics because apparently there's an arithmetic bug.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:54.260]   Math is so hard.
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:55.580]   Especially for computers.
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:56.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:04.820]   So it looks like that this R conference is uploaded 74 gigabytes, the drop cam 1.25 terabytes.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.100]   Anyway, it's a known issue and they're working on a fix.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.100]   And I'm sure that's just a firmware fix.
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.780]   Ooh, do you want to speak about drop cam?
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:12.780]   Some news there.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:18.500]   Well, Jeff, Jeff, I'm going to have to be the judge and jury here and say...
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:25.420]   No, no, I was just saying for IO, it's got to be a lot of AI stuff.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.420]   Yes.
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:27.420]   Yes, that's all.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.420]   Yes.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:29.420]   I want to see it consistent in more places.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.820]   I hope so.
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.580]   More capabilities, the same capabilities or...
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.460]   They got to pour it on and then pour it on.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.460]   That's right.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.460]   Yeah, I mean, Amazon's...
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.300]   Look at echoes in cars everywhere.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.300]   It's all over the place.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.300]   I think they need to talk more about the API.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.700]   They need to have more libraries.
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:50.260]   They need to do something to encourage more developers to create.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:54.500]   They also need to work on their data sharing policies and work there because one of the
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:58.460]   challenges is a lot of companies are like, "I don't want to work with Google because
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.620]   they're going to take my data."
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:01.620]   Right.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.540]   And Amazon's like, "If I take your data, it's only because I want to sell people more
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.540]   stuff.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:06.540]   I don't want to sell them.
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:07.540]   I want to sell them more stuff."
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:08.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:09.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:10.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.

[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:50.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:54.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:57.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:58.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:59.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:03.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:05.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:09.540]   I want to sell them more stuff.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:13.440]   I think a lot of times, though, these people are just good engineers or maybe good managers
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.900]   of engineering teams and they don't necessarily end up doing the same thing.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.700]   He may not want to do a camera.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:23.700]   The other thing is, if he's not doing a camera, what he did do at Dropcam that's worth noting
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:27.460]   is he helped do the computer vision.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:32.540]   All of Dropcam's not all.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:38.380]   I don't know if it was people opting in or if it was because you can't anonymize camera
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:42.540]   data, but they took the camera data to do some computer vision and image recognition
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.540]   stuff.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.820]   He's managed people doing that.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.820]   I don't think he's like an AI.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.820]   He's a...
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.700]   In fact, this story was broken.
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:56.540]   We should give credit by Reid Albergotti from the Information Jessica Lessons Information.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.540]   Oh, fabulous.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:02.820]   They say brings an experience to consumer electronics entrepreneur into the company.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:05.180]   They don't really say particularly his camera expertise.
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:07.380]   Could be interesting, though.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:13.660]   I mean, he found a Dropcam because he wanted to find out what animal was pooping in his
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.780]   dad's knee or his dad's yard.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:16.780]   Oh.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:18.100]   He actually founded it based on...
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:23.980]   He was taking off the shelf kind of stuff to build a camera for him and then that turned
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:24.980]   into Dropcam.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.540]   It's a very cool story.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:33.540]   He was not, according to the correction from the information, a manager, a rather an executive
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.540]   at Dropcam.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.700]   He was a manager for camera engineering at Nest.
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.820]   So maybe he is more...
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:43.620]   An engineering manager or a manager of teams like that.
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.660]   Anyway, very interesting.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:46.660]   Ta-da.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.260]   Thank you for that news.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.260]   You got it in those days.
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.260]   He had to bring us back.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.260]   He had to reel us back.
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.260]   But you did it.
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.260]   That's right.
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.260]   I did it.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.260]   We're going to...
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:57.260]   I want to talk about Chromebooks.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.260]   Your favorite subject, Jeff and Jeff.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.260]   Yay!
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.580]   But first a word from Blue Apron.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:03.940]   You're going to get to the end of the day today.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:04.940]   You're working hard.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:05.940]   You're tired.
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:08.100]   You're hungry.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.260]   The whistle blows.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:12.020]   The five o'clock whistle blows.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.060]   And then you think, "Oh, I have to plan a meal.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.660]   Go shopping for the ingredients and make it."
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:18.820]   No.
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:22.140]   So you go to Jack in the box and have one of those tacos.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.860]   It's like wet cat food in a shell.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:30.980]   Or if you get Blue Apron, you go home and there's a box on your doorstep full of delicious
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:34.980]   ingredients and a meal you can make in 40 minutes.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:38.460]   That's amazing that will blow you away.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.700]   That's a better way to go.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:44.900]   Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.300]   Supporting a more sustainable food system.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:51.580]   Setting the highest standards for ingredients and building a community of home chefs.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:57.260]   Whether you get the Blue Apron for two or you get the Blue Apron for families, each box
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:03.980]   contains three separate meals for two or for your family that have all the ingredients.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:04.980]   No more no less.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:08.060]   So if you need two tablespoons of soy sauce, you get that.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:12.060]   You don't end up having extra stuff lying around.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.900]   You might think as I did, "Oh, this is going to cost more than if I just went to the store
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:16.900]   and got it."
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.900]   No.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:19.900]   Grocery store is going to be 60% more expensive than Blue Apron.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.540]   So you're saving money too.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.980]   It is amazing.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:24.980]   And the best food.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.500]   I mean, there is no junk in there.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:27.500]   Everything's fresh, not frozen.
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:28.820]   Even the meats and the fish.
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.260]   It's a refrigerated box.
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:36.940]   They get their produce and their meats from over 150 local farms, fisheries and ranchers
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:39.580]   across the United States.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.940]   It is good stuff.
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:44.500]   And you're going to learn a great skill and build bonds.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:50.340]   Because when you're cooking for your family, you're cooking, you're making love.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.020]   It's an incredible feeling to do it.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.100]   I know you want to do this more and you can.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:59.860]   According to Blue Apron research, families that use Blue Apron cook together three times
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:01.380]   more often.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.380]   What's on the menu this week?
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:07.580]   Go to Blue Apron.com/twig, spicy shrimp in Korean rice cakes with cabbage and for a
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:11.140]   kake, hoisin chicken, steamed buns.
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.140]   This is so good.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.900]   And once you learn to make this, you're going to make it a lot with broccoli and marinated
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:19.860]   carrots, cheesy chicken and black bean enchiladas with salsa verde.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:20.860]   Oh, vegetarians?
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:22.660]   Sure, they've got vegetarian meals.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:23.980]   You can pick your meal.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:26.860]   You can eat about warm cauliflower and kale salad.
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:31.900]   Oh, that looks so good with soft boiled eggs.
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.900]   Oh, man.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:36.460]   Anyway, I'm going to get you three meals free.
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:37.460]   That's all you really need to know.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:43.060]   Go to Blue Apron.com/twig, Blue Apron.com/twig.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:48.940]   Get your first three meals free.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:50.700]   So I think it's interesting.
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:54.660]   I wonder if Google I/O Google announced a new Chromebook Pixel.
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:58.780]   I think not because I think what they're doing instead, which makes a lot of sense, is partnering
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:03.460]   with existing companies to make kind of reference platforms.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:08.220]   I'm very excited about Samsung's Chromebook Pro and Plus.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.220]   I am too.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.820]   I think I'll get the Pro, but the Asus has a lot more battery.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.820]   And this new Asus, which they're saying is for education.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.660]   Well, there's another Asus.
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:18.660]   Oh, there's another one.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.540]   Yeah, there's another one that they announced.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.540]   That's a yes.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.540]   Was it Asus or was it?
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.540]   Maybe it was.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.460]   There's an Acer and an Asus for education.
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:27.460]   Right.
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.180]   And they also have these educational ones just announced.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.500]   And all of these new ones, Google has said everything announced and shipped in 2017 will
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.540]   be Android Store ready, Play Store ready.
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:41.780]   So you're going to, I'm telling you, I think this is maybe even the future of computing.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:42.780]   All of them USB-C.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.700]   And more of those weird adapters.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.700]   Yes.
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:53.100]   Big news today, which was Adobe is bringing full power apps to the Chrome OS through Android.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.100]   That's huge.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.140]   So this is Adobe's plan on iOS.
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.060]   They said Lightroom, we talked to Russell Brown.
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:06.220]   He said Lightroom for the tablet is going to be at some point where our total intention
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:11.140]   is to make it a full fledged equal to the Lightroom on the desktop.
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:16.660]   And that is for a photographer, a very natural workflow is to edit photos, just to touch
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:19.620]   them to, I mean, it's just very natural.
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.740]   This is huge, I think.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.900]   And it will put that in the comments right now.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.900]   There's the Adobe.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.300]   It'll be my platform of choice, I think.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.300]   Wow.
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.300]   Wow.
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.300]   Well, I love Linux.
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.300]   I love the stability.
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.300]   I love how secure it is.
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.300]   Yep, I do too.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.260]   And there's no hassles.
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:39.220]   These devices go all day.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.220]   Yep.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:50.020]   Yeah, so Photoshop, if I can travel with a combination of Chrome and Android and a pen,
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.660]   and be able to watch my movies in the plane and then we'll work on something to write
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.900]   it's ideal.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:59.860]   So these are the Creative Cloud apps that will be optimized for Chrome OS.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:05.180]   Photoshop Mix, Lightroom Mobile, Illustrator, Draw, Photoshop Sketch, Adobe Comp CC, I'm
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.180]   not sure what that is.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.140]   It sounds like a composite program.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.420]   Creative Cloud Mobile.
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:16.980]   And that's important for education too because these, Adobe would love to get you when you're
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:21.500]   in school using these programs so that you'll use them when you get out of school.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.740]   How limited is Photoshop Mix?
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:24.740]   Pretty limited.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:30.700]   It's really intended for the one thing which a lot of people do, which is to take a picture,
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:36.100]   like cut your head off and put Oprah's body on it or vice versa.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.980]   That kind of editing.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:39.300]   So internet memes you mean?
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.380]   Internet meme machine.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.180]   But Lightroom Mobile is a much more complete.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:47.700]   And as I said, I think Adobe's long-term goal is to really make Photoshop Mix be Photoshop
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.700]   and Lightroom Mobile be Lightroom.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:50.660]   Mm, let's have it.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:51.820]   That would be very exciting.
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:56.180]   And it's one of the things that keeps you off of a Chromebook by the way.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:58.020]   Good video editing, good photo editing, or the...
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.540]   Yes, that's pretty much it.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.860]   And Skype.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.180]   But so I haven't tried calling it to the show from...
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:08.780]   When I get to new machine, we'll try Skype through Android into the show.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:09.780]   Good.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.780]   I haven't done that.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.780]   I'd love to try that.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:12.780]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.860]   We did it as a small test that first week.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:15.860]   But...
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:18.900]   The other thing that's interesting, this Acer Chromebook Spin, is that the one you're interested
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.620]   in?
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.100]   This is the education one.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.980]   No, it's a different one.
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:24.980]   It's the Asus, I think.
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:29.100]   The stylus on this, which kind of looks like a Samsung stylus, it's a flat stylus that
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:35.060]   goes into the body of it, is Wacom and it's using the Wacom EMR standard.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.820]   Which is what artists want.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.820]   This is really...
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.820]   I have to say this is compelling.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.580]   And these things are a few hundred bucks.
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.180]   Well, the Samsung will get you up, I think 600 or something.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:49.980]   I spent almost 500 for this Chromebook Plus.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.660]   That's the first one that will be available early February.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.300]   And I'll tell you what, since you're going for the Pro, which is not out yet and it's
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.980]   going to be out later, the Pro is Intel, the Plus is ARM.
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.340]   That's the chief distinction.
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:03.300]   I'll have the Plus and I'll show you and you can...
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.300]   Yeah.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.300]   I'm excited.
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:11.820]   They say the spin has military grade durability, which is what you want for a school.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:14.540]   It's MilSpec 810G.
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:17.220]   I don't know.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.220]   Wow.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.220]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.220]   And it incorporates...
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.220]   No idea what that means, but we want to say wow.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:25.460]   So a drainage system that's great for when you spill your water on into the board.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.100]   A unique drainage system.
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.100]   What?
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.100]   That's awesome.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:32.940]   Which can endure up to 330 milliliters of spilled water and channels liquid away from
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.260]   important components.
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.700]   That would help at Starbucks for sure.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.740]   That would help at my desk.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:42.580]   My husband's like, "Are you drinking water at your desk again?"
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:43.580]   I'm like, "Ooh."
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:48.860]   So it prevents students from removing, swapping, or otherwise interfering with the keys.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.660]   What are students doing to keys?
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:51.660]   Okay, so when...
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:53.260]   Please follow them sometimes.
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:56.580]   When the Obama transition happened in 2008.
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.500]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:04.140]   When the Clinton transition happened in 2001, the Clinton staffers removed all the
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:13.260]   W keys from the keyboard so that W, George W Bush, would staff whatever hard time typing.
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.260]   That was a mean prank.
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.980]   I thought that was a problem.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:17.980]   I don't think it's a problem.
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.980]   It would be even better.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:22.900]   It would be even better is just to remap the keyboard, leave the keys where they are,
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.380]   but make them make different letters.
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.380]   Right.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:30.180]   I think that's also hard to do on Chrome OS.
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:35.940]   I think Google has the right strategy with Chrome OS because once you add these apps
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:39.780]   from the Android store and if these apps get more and more desk-ed up like, which is
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:44.820]   I think the trend, this is going to be a nice platform.
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:45.820]   I'm excited.
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:51.020]   Do you see Chrome and Android continuing?
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.500]   Or do you see that one of them winning?
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.100]   That's a question we've asked again and again and again.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.500]   I don't know.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.980]   I think Android for phones makes a lot of sense.
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:05.220]   I think Chrome OS for tablets makes a lot of sense.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.380]   I think that's fine.
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.380]   Do you need?
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.380]   They're both Linux-based.
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:11.380]   Yeah, I guess one doesn't have to win.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.220]   And the Play Store is on both which is the real virtue.
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:19.100]   This is what Microsoft desperately trying to do is create this universal Windows platform
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:24.700]   so that a developer will develop for all of Microsoft Windows, mobile, tablet and desktop.
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:31.700]   And it's been rough going.
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:35.660]   Google's kind of, they said, "Well, we don't have to.
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.900]   Just keep doing your Android apps.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.900]   We'll make sure they run on Chrome."
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.580]   Yeah, and having Android apps on a Chromebook would be super useful for sure.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.140]   A touch Chromebook.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.140]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.140]   Speaking of Android, Hugo Barra is out at Xiaomi.
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:49.820]   So remember Hugo Barra, the great Google executive.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:52.100]   He was the king of demos.
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:53.580]   Was always on stage at Google.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:56.780]   Then he went to Xiaomi where he did much the same thing.
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:58.340]   And he says, "I'm tired of living in China.
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:01.180]   I want to be back in the States with my family and friends."
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:05.380]   He doesn't say what he'll be doing when he comes back, but he says, "He'll be embarking
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:08.100]   on a new adventure back in Silicon Valley."
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.740]   Oh, wait.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:12.740]   Can we talk about this?
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.780]   Is Elon Musk really building a tunnel?
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.380]   Did you guys see his tweet?
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.380]   Because that happened.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:21.380]   He's already broken ground.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.740]   Provals, doesn't he?
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:24.900]   Well, I imagine so.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:29.500]   So his plan is this all came from a tweet where he was bemoaning LA traffic.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.860]   He said, "I just want a tunnel underneath."
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.860]   And then the story today is that they've already broken ground in a tunnel.
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:38.340]   He's going to buy these tunnel boring machines.
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.500]   And he says, "Look, it's the same thing as flying cars.
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.140]   You go up or you go down."
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:50.380]   But aren't there structural things that are about further weight, safety?
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.380]   No, no, no.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.380]   No, no, no.
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.380]   It's Elon Musk.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.380]   You're worrying too much.
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:56.380]   There's a fault line out there, right?
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:02.980]   If everyone independently builds their own tunnel, that feels like, yeah, this, okay,
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:10.380]   thank you, because I saw his tweet and amidst all the other unbelievable trees coming down
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.380]   there.
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:12.380]   Was it just going to be Elon's tunnel or?
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:13.380]   Well, that's the question.
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:14.380]   How does this help traffic?
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.420]   If you let everybody in the tunnel, it's worse.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:22.700]   So obviously, the key is maybe it's a private tunnel.
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:24.380]   So it's a test of a tunnel.
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:25.380]   It's a test of a tunnel.
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:28.780]   Well, he's building one under the gig of the SpaceX factory, right?
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:31.300]   He should just buy a helicopter.
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:34.780]   My God, that's what other rich executives who hate traffic do.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.860]   And there's been progress in that regard.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:41.760]   I mean, it was clear that flying cars were a bad idea if you let people drive them, but
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.300]   autonomous flying cars, not such a bad idea.
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:48.220]   And people are already talking about doing that.
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:52.340]   Here's Elon's tweet from early from 1 AM.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.180]   Yes.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:57.300]   Exciting progress on the tunnel front plan to start digging in a month or so.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.300]   Oh, I thought he'd already broken ground.
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.500]   Oh, he's, he's trolling us.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.100]   Well, he did put tunnels as part of his Twitter bio.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.820]   He's trolling us.
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:12.980]   The problem is he spent, he splits his time between SpaceX and Tesla HQ.
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:15.780]   So the tunnel would have to go all the way up to Fremont.
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:16.780]   That's a law.
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:19.340]   He would have to buy mineral rights, all kinds of things.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:20.820]   Didn't he say to LAX?
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:21.740]   Isn't that what the--
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:22.740]   LAX was the airport.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:23.740]   Oh, OK.
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:24.740]   OK.
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:29.020]   So his desk to the airport, and he does travel a lot to his helicopter, perhaps.
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.700]   Why not just get a helicopter?
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.300]   Because that what rich people use.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.300]   I just said that.
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:35.300]   No, but he said, no.
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.300]   Here's the advantage of a tunnel.
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:37.300]   You don't have to worry about the weather.
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.940]   It's always sunny underground.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.380]   He says you don't have to worry about cave-ins.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:45.300]   I don't know what he's got.
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:47.900]   But what he needs is a thing that just does it.
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.700]   You can start a construct book villain.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:52.700]   Oh, it was in the Incredibles.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:53.700]   It was in the Incredibles.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.700]   The Incredibles.
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:55.700]   It was in the Incredibles.
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:58.700]   Hey, if Mark Zuckerberg can build a wall around his island.
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:03.780]   Hey, Google Fiber actually has some incredible boring technology, and they're getting out
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:04.780]   of that business.
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:05.780]   So--
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:06.780]   There's--
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:07.780]   It's energy.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:09.740]   You have to get a really small car.
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:12.060]   I just like how it's boring technology.
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.060]   Oh, I love it.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.380]   That's the name of the company, by the way.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:15.380]   The boring company.
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:17.380]   That's a joke, right?
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.780]   Well, I can't tell what's real anymore.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.780]   Jesus.
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:21.780]   When you live--
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.780]   No.
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:23.780]   Neither can you are.
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:24.780]   That's his point.
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.780]   We were living in a simulation.
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:28.860]   So do what the hell you want, because it doesn't matter.
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:29.860]   Oh, Lord.
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:30.860]   OK.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.860]   All right.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.860]   Sorry.
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:37.060]   I just wanted Joel's opinion.
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.980]   No, I think that that's real.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.740]   I don't think he's making that up, but who knows?
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:42.740]   You're right.
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.380]   You can't tell.
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:45.980]   Let's see.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.220]   I want to do a few more, and then we're going to take a break, because I want to get you
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.380]   out of here in 15 minutes.
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.140]   Samsung says it's going to stick with the Note brand.
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.340]   It did release this week.
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:59.020]   The study that said there were two problems, two different manufacturers.
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:04.980]   Problem one, with the original Galaxy Note 7 was, as we-- everybody suspected and was leaked,
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:09.780]   the batteries didn't fit the case properly, and that caused leaks and explosions.
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:15.740]   And then they rushed to get replacements out, and the replacement batteries had another
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.500]   leaking issue, and that's why.
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:18.900]   So two separate issues.
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:23.100]   They announced an eight-point plan to prevent this from happening, things that are kind
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:27.860]   of unprecedented, like x-raying every battery before they put it on the phone to make sure
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:30.020]   it's manufactured properly.
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:33.820]   And they said, as a result, we are going to be able to stick with the Note brand.
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:38.940]   We think the next Note will be safe, and I imagine it will.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:43.100]   Although I won't be the first one to go to bed with one.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:49.020]   They also say they're going to delay the Galaxy S8, which is-- usually the S8 comes out in
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:53.340]   the spring, the Note comes out in the fall, the S8 will come out after mobile world congress
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:54.340]   this year.
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:58.580]   And I think there's a reason they're delaying it until April, because they've cornered the
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:05.100]   market on the Snapdragon 835, and no one can make a phone with a Snapdragon 835 until
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:06.620]   Samsung's comes out.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:10.540]   So the longer they wait, the better it is for them.
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:14.460]   Incidentally, quarterly results out for both Samsung and LG.
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.540]   Samsung actually had a great quarter.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.820]   They survived the Note fiasco.
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:23.340]   They had written it off in the previous quarter and made a lot of money, not so good for
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:29.220]   LG, which is frankly lagging in its sales of its most recent phone.
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:33.900]   It increasingly feels like Samsung is dominating the Android space, just as Apple dominates
[01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:37.820]   the iOS space.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.820]   Anything else?
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.140]   What else can we talk about?
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:43.820]   I can doodle 630 if you want to keep going.
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:44.820]   Okay.
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:49.260]   I just have to be-- I have to test my Japan connection at 640.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.700]   Oh, so you're going to Skype in?
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:52.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:57.740]   Yeah, they're-- I have to do a talk in an hour, and then I have to another one about two in
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:58.740]   the morning.
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:04.540]   EFF, by the way, we were talking about net neutrality and the EFF has a 100-day plan,
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:10.380]   which they announced a few days before the inauguration for how they want to deal with
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:13.300]   a Trump era.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:16.060]   They say, "Hey, we sued Clinton.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.380]   We sued Bush.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.860]   We sued Obama.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:24.900]   I think you can see where we're going with this."
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:30.660]   So big four, surveillance, net neutrality, press freedom.
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.260]   We will continue to defend digital rights in court.
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:40.020]   The EFF, I think people may not know that the Electronic Frontier Foundation seizes its
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.660]   mandate going to court.
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.900]   That's what they do.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:52.460]   Different organizations do different things, but the EFF was founded to pursue policy changes
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:53.820]   through court cases.
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:56.500]   So suing is what they do.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:59.800]   We will test and leverage the Freedom of Information Act, and today they filed their
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:04.940]   first FOIA request for Trump documents.
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.100]   So we'll see.
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:12.780]   That's one of many court fronts that the president is fighting on, but that FOIA request is an
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:15.380]   interesting angle.
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:21.940]   It's interesting that did you see the group, one of the groups who was behind the Panama
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:27.060]   papers said that they were very much like to do the same thing for Trump.
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:31.060]   So if anyone has any documents, feel free to send them.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.540]   Yeah, everybody's looking for leaks and...
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:34.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:35.540]   Intercept, ProPublica.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:37.580]   The media is thirsty for leaks.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:42.740]   Well, and the servants will be fascinating when you have the Park Service folks.
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:43.740]   Yeah, look at them.
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:44.740]   And look at the crowd.
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:45.740]   Are now subtweeting brilliantly.
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:46.740]   Isn't that weird?
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:53.820]   So Trump banned the Park Service from tweeting, and as a result, they created an unofficial
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:54.820]   account.
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:57.140]   They say, "You can't stop us from doing it on a free time."
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:25:01.860]   Yeah, even so at the official one, at the Death Valley one, they did a...
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:07.180]   As soon as Trump started talking about keeping immigrants out, they started talking about
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.180]   men's and are...
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:09.180]   Wow.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.180]   Brilliant subtweeting.
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:11.180]   Brilliant.
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:15.940]   Isn't the Department of Defense, are they also subtweeting him?
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:16.940]   Really?
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:17.940]   That was the most...
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:18.940]   Well, there was...
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:19.940]   That was the most...
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.220]   But let's see, hold on.
[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.100]   So here's the interesting thing.
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:30.020]   All that the National Park Service, not the tweets about the crowds, but all that the
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:31.860]   Badlands Park Service...
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.420]   The Badlands one is the...
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.420]   The only one...
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.420]   That's the one.
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:38.740]   The only thing it was doing was tweeting actual facts about climate change.
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.460]   Well, and they weren't...
[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:44.260]   So I'm not sure whether they were blocked and came back, but they are back now.
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.260]   So I'm not...
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:47.420]   Yeah, no, they were ordered to remove the tweets.
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:50.660]   Well, they came back from the White House.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.940]   But the tweets were back?
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:54.460]   Yeah, I believe so.
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:55.460]   You could check them.
[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:59.700]   Okay, 'cause they said that someone got access to the account who wasn't supposed to,
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.420]   there were multiple stories.
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:05.340]   We were out shoveling snow, I think was one of them.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:09.900]   But it was interesting to me that all they were really doing was posting facts.
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:10.900]   And in this...
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:11.900]   No facts loud.
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:15.620]   Interesting and actual fact is seen as somehow subversive.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.820]   Well, maybe they aren't...
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:18.820]   Well, it is.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:20.300]   I thought I'd seen that they were back.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.500]   Yeah, it's just frightening that that is subversive.
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.180]   Posting facts is actually subversive.
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:31.940]   So the Department of Defense, it's an open question because on January 23rd, they did
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:32.940]   something...
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:36.260]   They tweeted social media posting, "Sometimes provide an important window into a person's
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:37.260]   mental health.
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.260]   Know what to look for."
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:41.540]   Well, that is a little snarky.
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:42.540]   And then they did...
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:43.540]   But that's the thing you don't know.
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:44.540]   You don't know.
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:45.540]   'Cause there was a tweet.
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:50.900]   They did a story about from refugee to Marine, this particular corporal.
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:56.500]   Ali J. Muhammad takes the fight to the doorsteps of those who cast his family out.
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:01.100]   And this is 10 hours ago, soon after Trump announced his, "Nobody can come in."
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:09.260]   One of the things that seems most reprehensible to me, Trump reversed a order to prevent
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:15.820]   companies from dumping toxic upstream of water treatment plants, which seems on the
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:18.660]   face of it a bad idea.
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:23.860]   But this was an EPA regulation, which has been reversed, I think it was reversed yesterday.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:27.260]   And then instructed the EPA not to say any...
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:28.500]   You know, gag order.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.940]   You can't say anything about it.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:37.460]   So he kills the clean water rule and then says, "Oh, by the way, EPA, you're not to say
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:40.700]   a word one way or the other."
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:47.180]   Now I think this is, I believe, on Trump's part of misinterpretation of the role of the
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.180]   president.
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.500]   Some have called it the...
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:57.980]   Not authoritarian, but personification, where the person of the president trumps to use
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:01.100]   upon all other agencies.
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.300]   And it's not that way normally.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:08.260]   The president is an employee of the US people.
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:12.900]   He puts directors in charge of agencies, but the agencies still have some autonomy.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:13.900]   They're not...
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.620]   He doesn't have total control over everything that happens.
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:18.620]   But we know...
[01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:20.260]   I mean, that's not a surprise, right?
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:23.020]   I mean, that is the way that Trump is operating it.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:24.020]   Well, it's not a surprise that he's attempting it.
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:27.100]   It'll be very interesting to see how this plays out.
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.100]   He can't...
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:29.100]   Already, it seems.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:36.620]   I mean, the Washington Post has these inside the White House leaks that kind of imply that
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:42.140]   the president can't even control his aides, staff, and household members.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:43.420]   It's such as that.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:44.860]   He can't control himself.
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:49.820]   I mean, the one thing that comes out of that article is as soon as he sees something on
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:54.380]   TV that makes him mad or he sees a tweet, yeah, he...
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:59.060]   Maggie Haberman, who's a great New York Times-wise model, had a tweet stream just this afternoon.
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:00.060]   About this.
[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:04.060]   How he gets overtired and watches TV and...
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:05.060]   Me too.
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:06.060]   Me too.
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:09.060]   But you're not wearing the free world with the...
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:11.060]   Most of Twitter is that.
[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:12.060]   And then he orders...
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.420]   People who should be eating and sleeping more.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:15.420]   Then he orders the...
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.420]   Ariana.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:18.060]   To delete their tweets or whatever.
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.060]   Right.
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:22.060]   Or then he says, "We're going to send the military into Chicago."
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:23.060]   Right.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:24.060]   And someone...
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:25.060]   So he...
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.780]   Technically, that was just the feds.
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:31.940]   And went through a bunch of his tweets and pegged them to whatever was on Fox News at
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:32.940]   the time.
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:35.260]   So if he happens to be watching Fox News...
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.660]   Well, and this was one of the leaks, by the way, that I think the Washington Post got
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:45.180]   that Trump was watching a network news report about murders in Chicago.
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.180]   And then tweeted...
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.860]   He's sitting there and tweeted immediately.
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:50.660]   We're going to send the feds in.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:55.620]   Interestingly, we had reported earlier, as had the New York Times, that the president's
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:00.540]   beloved Android phone was taken away from him and he replaced with a secure phone.
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:01.540]   He's got it now.
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:03.940]   That it was not or he got it back.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:04.940]   Right.
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:08.180]   And that's what he has at night when he's in the residence.
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.380]   And he's watching TV.
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:11.340]   He has his old Samsung phone.
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:16.340]   And Edward Snowden tweeted earlier today, "I wonder what...
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:19.900]   We think it's a galaxy, Samsung Galaxy, but we don't know what vintage."
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:22.260]   He said, "This could be a massive security."
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:25.580]   Well, this could be a massive security problem.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:29.620]   If it's not running the latest Android, which many Galaxy phones are not.
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:31.260]   Well, security do what?
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:33.460]   Except find out where he is.
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.460]   What could it do?
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:36.900]   Well, this is another thing is that the...
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:38.220]   Is he taking the emails?
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.540]   I mean, are his emails coming into that phone?
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:41.940]   The new...
[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:46.700]   This is another hacker pointed out that both the POTUS account and real Donald Trump are
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:49.940]   tied to not government mail servers.
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:50.940]   Right.
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:51.940]   Personal servers.
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.940]   But to Gmail.
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:53.940]   Hey.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.940]   Oh, Lord.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:58.100]   All of the top people have Republican mail accounts.
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:00.020]   I have a Republican server.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:02.860]   And easily guessed the email address.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:08.820]   For instance, a hacker pointed out that Pence's Twitter account points back to an email because
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:15.620]   you can ask and it will show you with asterisks that's v asterisk-asstris-esident@gmail.com.
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:19.340]   Oh, no.
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:28.060]   And the hacker said, "As soon as you know what that email address is for the Twitter reset,
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.900]   they're not using two factor," he said.
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:30.900]   As soon as you know...
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:31.900]   Oh, geez.
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:32.900]   As soon as you...
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:33.900]   There's very insecure.
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:38.180]   As soon as you know what that email address is, then you have a target and you can go after
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:39.180]   their Gmail address.
[01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:47.380]   Now, I should point out, I presume and I would hope that @POTUS at least has higher protections,
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:51.460]   both from Twitter and from the Secret Service.
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:52.460]   One would hope.
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:53.460]   You would hope.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:57.420]   Although, technically, isn't Mike Pence the one doing most of the policymaking because
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:59.420]   Trump is not really...
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:00.420]   He's busy.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:01.420]   It wasn't that what he...
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.900]   No, I think it's...
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:03.900]   But Bannon.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:07.620]   Trump is making a policy on Twitter at three o'clock in the morning.
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:09.020]   Well, it's interesting because...
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:13.700]   Okay, so Trump tweeted at real Donald Trump, you know, the...
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:14.940]   I will send in the feds.
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:18.820]   But then @POTUS retweeted it.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:22.180]   So @POTUS is being used...
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:23.420]   I don't know how this works.
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:26.420]   Is that Bannon or Conway or somebody?
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:27.820]   I don't know.
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:30.500]   Retweeting the real Donald Trump.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:34.060]   In any event, all of this seems like a bad idea.
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:38.900]   And I think one of the reasons you're seeing the leaks to The Washington Post is some of
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:43.220]   his aides seem to be a little frustrated, hoping that they said we're trying to get him
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:48.420]   to watch less TV because he gets excited.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:50.980]   If someone...
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:55.580]   I mean, think about how people feel after they watch Fox News.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.340]   I want a tweet.
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:58.340]   Right.
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:04.260]   And so if that's your policy engine, that is a real issue.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:06.740]   I mean, that's what you see on Twitter.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:08.180]   It's just that maybe this isn't...
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:13.340]   So this is what the Park Service is doing, ALT US Nat Park Service.
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:19.820]   The unofficial resistance team of the US National Park Service, not taxpayer subsidized, come
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:24.420]   for rugged scenery, fossil beds, 89 acres of, a million acres of landscape.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:30.180]   And they've tweeted a pretty insulting cartoon.
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.060]   Donald Trump saying, "I decide what is the truth.
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:34.060]   I alone control what you could say or hear.
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:35.060]   Listen only to me.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:36.060]   Oh, baby.
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:37.060]   Love me."
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:41.620]   So the National Park Service tweeting, "Nope."
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:44.820]   So quoting is this independent story.
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:50.940]   POTUS is actually run by Dan Skavino, who's Trump's director of social media.
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:55.020]   But he's retweeting real Donald Trump, so it doesn't matter.
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:57.020]   Right.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:01.620]   So Skavino is a fan of Info Wars conspiracy theories.
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:02.620]   Apparently.
[01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.100]   It's just an interesting time we live in.
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.540]   Well, that's one word for it.
[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:10.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:17.620]   We don't even have to talk about the face of neo-colonialism in Hawaii, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:23.340]   That really sounded actually, yeah, like just trying to get the landowners to come out of
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:24.740]   the woodwork.
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:26.860]   Everything I read about that doesn't look like he's evil.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:30.860]   It's like, I just want to know who owns this.
[01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:35.900]   The more I read about it, the more it seemed to me like that's a common strategy that
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:41.300]   you have to use to find out who the heck has access rights to your land because of the
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.220]   way Hawaii works.
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:46.980]   It didn't sound to me like it was just Mark Zuckerberg being a tech.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.860]   He wasn't trying to get them not to walk across his land?
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:50.860]   No, that's...
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:51.860]   No, he's trying to find out who they were.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.860]   Just who they are.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:57.020]   He doesn't know who has the rights to own that land.
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.020]   Right.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.180]   This is kind of the equivalent of your state running those.
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:04.260]   You may have unclaimed property ads, except he has to sue to get the information.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:05.460]   It goes by family.
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:11.540]   And so there could be family members who have rights to access, but they may not even know
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.540]   it.
[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:17.940]   Makala, Kaoh Moana, the executive director of an environmental group in Hanalei, Kauai,
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:22.300]   said the lawsuits would help identify and inform descendants of links to the land they
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:25.660]   may not know about, which is a good thing.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:27.140]   The optics aren't good.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:28.140]   Right.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:33.220]   But I mean, as soon as Mark Zuckerberg does anything, the optics instantly become bad.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:35.180]   Right.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:39.980]   Another Hawaiian state representative, Kanehela, Ng of Maui, said Zuckerberg is saying he wants
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:41.780]   to respect the local culture.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:45.460]   I was always told if there was a dispute with somebody, you go and knock on their door,
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:49.220]   you sit down and you kukakuka and you...
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:50.820]   Huponono, hold on.
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.380]   But he doesn't know...
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:53.500]   He can't knock on their door.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:54.500]   That's kind of the point.
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.180]   That person's being disengineered.
[01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:58.940]   So he just really wants to kukakuka.
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:02.180]   It's like their great-great-grandfather, head access rights.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:03.260]   It's like Ajit Pai.
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:05.900]   We don't know what he's going to do yet.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:06.900]   He may kukakuka.
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:09.460]   Oh, you're throwing Ajit Pai in my face.
[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:10.460]   I am.
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:11.460]   You know why?
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.460]   Because I have to leave.
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:13.460]   I was going like, you know that.
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:14.780]   She was throwing Pai at me.
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:17.660]   Can you wait one minute or do you really have to go now?
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:18.660]   I will wait.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:19.660]   This is your warning.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:20.660]   This is your five minute warning.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:21.740]   It is really past time.
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:24.740]   So let me just quickly mention our ad because I want to get...
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.380]   Do you have a thing for us?
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:27.380]   I can.
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:30.420]   Would you prefer to do a thing before the ad?
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:33.020]   That would be better because I do have to pick up my child and I don't want to be...
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.020]   Oh, no.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:36.540]   We don't want to leave your child sitting waiting at her...
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:38.020]   At her school.
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:40.020]   At her special school.
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.820]   For her intelligent children.
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:42.820]   For a special school.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:46.300]   No, I figure she goes to some genius school, don't you think?
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.300]   She does.
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:48.300]   She is in genius school.
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.940]   The school for peculiar children.
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:51.940]   For the gifted.
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:54.700]   For the gifted child.
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:56.700]   For the gifted children.
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.700]   For the gifted children.
[01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:00.700]   You might switch.
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:03.060]   I just need to get the pricing on this because I'm bad.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:05.820]   I think it's 50 bucks but I don't want to make that up.
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:06.820]   Oh, it is.
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.820]   Good guess.
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:08.820]   You know what?
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:09.820]   You do this long enough, Stacey.
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:12.300]   Isn't it true you can almost always guess the price?
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.300]   I can guess the rate.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.780]   Is the ratio where you get the price?
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:15.780]   Yeah, within like 10 bucks.
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:16.780]   Yes.
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:17.780]   The IOT.
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:18.780]   What's the price is right?
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:19.780]   Price is right.
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:20.780]   Yeah, you should do the prices right.
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:24.060]   Oh, that's another thing we should do in our game of geeks.
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:25.060]   That's the price.
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:27.580]   Ooh, I want to play that game.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.620]   Okay, I have for you.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.620]   Can I give it to you or?
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:31.620]   Give it to me.
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:32.620]   Give it to me.
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:33.620]   All right, here you guys.
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:35.620]   I don't mean the boxing love from behind the monitor.
[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:36.620]   What bam.
[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:37.620]   Oh, Pavlock.
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:40.620]   Do you know what that is?
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.620]   I do.
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:45.740]   So just put one of those on and I'll just zap you from afar.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:46.740]   I don't want.
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:49.820]   Becky, Becky Worley put one on me and it hurt.
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:50.820]   It does hurt.
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:52.820]   Every time you call me hun, though, I'd be like.
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:55.500]   I haven't called you a hunt ever since that day.
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.300]   Is this because of once I called you honey once.
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:37:59.300]   Ooh, sure.
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:00.300]   It was better.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:01.300]   It was somewhat.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:02.300]   It was I was.
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:04.380]   I would I am just teasing you.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.620]   It is so fun.
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:09.940]   That's why I want the boxing glove because at least there be immediate and direct retribution.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:12.420]   Stacy, I would have to suffer.
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.420]   Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie, darling.
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:15.420]   Come me, sweetie.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:17.420]   What I might know.
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:21.620]   This is the Eve home kit compatible light switch.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:25.780]   But I'm showing it to you because I'm going to install it and I won't be able to show
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:27.980]   it to you once it's in my wall.
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:30.060]   So here's the back.
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:31.980]   Those are the wires I'm going to attach.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:33.980]   This is only good for one-way lights.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:35.580]   It's not good for three-way lights.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:37.740]   It works via Bluetooth.
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:44.460]   And this is a capacitive touch panel so you can actually do more than just go on off.
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.300]   You could go clockwise or counterclockwise.
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:51.580]   I actually don't know if those are supportive motion yet, but I'll let you know.
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:53.980]   But there are motions.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:56.020]   That's kind of cool.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:58.700]   I think it's a long-touch multi-tap.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:38:59.700]   Wow.
[01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:01.700]   I don't know how many options you have.
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:03.700]   I need a manual to turn on the one-touch.
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:04.700]   Is there a light touch?
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:07.940]   Oh, of course there is Leo.
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:08.940]   Leo.
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.580]   Stop touching me.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:19.940]   The reason I bring this up is because the only other option for you with home kit has
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:23.980]   been in the lighting for the switches, not for light bulbs because Q works with home
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:25.980]   kit is Lutron.
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:29.820]   But you have to buy the Lutron bridge, which right now I think is like $80 and then you
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.660]   have to buy a $65 Lutron compatible switch.
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:37.300]   So this is at $50, a little bit cheaper, and you don't have a bridge.
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:40.300]   So that's all I'm showing this to you guys.
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:45.580]   The only negative, and Dr. Morbius brings this up of that flat thing, is you can't really
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:46.740]   tell if it's off or on.
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:48.980]   There's no kind of physical indicator.
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:50.580]   The light is off or on.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.740]   Well, I know you say that.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.580]   Why do people say this all the time?
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:55.660]   Okay, I'll tell you why.
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:57.020]   I'll tell you why.
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:58.580]   I have this situation in my kitchen.
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:04.420]   I have many, many, many lights in my kitchen, all controlled by switches, and I can look
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:10.100]   up at the lights and some are on, some are off, but I can't be sure which set is on properly.
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:13.540]   But when I look at the switch, I know, oh, yeah, I need to still turn that one off.
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:18.820]   So with something like this, that's where the multi-touch blah, blah, blah comes in handy.
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:23.540]   You can actually, in the fact that it's programmable, you can actually just be like, all of my kitchen
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:27.140]   lights work on this button.
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:33.060]   And when I do this motion, only the ones over the sake turn on or however you want to do
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.060]   that.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:37.700]   I mean, you guys are still in this analog, stateful mindset.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:39.620]   We're just so, so limited.
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:44.060]   Gosh, this on/off switch is so primitive.
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:46.700]   And by the way, you can talk to it too, right?
[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:47.900]   It has an EVAT.
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:48.900]   It's Siri.
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:49.900]   What?
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:50.900]   By a Siri, yeah.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:52.260]   Yes, it's HomeKit compatible.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:53.260]   This is the HomeKit.
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:55.900]   Oh, so that's the feature of HomeKit, right, of course.
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:57.900]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:59.420]   So that is my thing for you this week.
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:03.820]   Next week, we'll have to figure this out because I bought a June oven.
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:04.820]   And if you guys want to show--
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:05.820]   You did it.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:06.820]   You pulled the trigger.
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:07.820]   Cookies fall.
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:11.380]   They just advertised on my show and I took their check and I was like, you know what I'm
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:12.380]   going to do with this?
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:13.380]   Buy an oven.
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:14.860]   I'm going to buy a June oven.
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:15.860]   I've been wanting it for ever and finally--
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:17.860]   Well, that's putting your money where your mouth is.
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:18.860]   That's good.
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:19.860]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:21.860]   I did that with a Ford vehicle.
[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:24.460]   No, seriously.
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:28.700]   I felt like if I'm going to do ads for Ford, I better drive a Ford so I got a Mustang.
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:29.700]   You got a--
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:30.700]   No, he has a Tesla.
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.700]   That was best to say.
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:33.700]   Yeah, unfortunately, Tesla does not advertise.
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.260]   So before you leave, Android Central--
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:40.020]   Well, you see, this Android Central has done detective work to figure out what phone
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:41.020]   Trump uses.
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:42.020]   Yeah, what?
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:43.020]   It determines an S3.
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:44.020]   Oh, my God.
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.020]   It's way out of date.
[01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:46.020]   Oh, they don't even support that anymore.
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:48.020]   They don't even support that anymore.
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:50.380]   Last updated 2015 on Jelly Bean.
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:53.580]   He's on Jelly Bean at best.
[01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:56.980]   Oh, how do they figure that out?
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:57.980]   Look, look, it's brilliant.
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:01.380]   Oh, they're like two pictures of him with his phone.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:06.740]   They figured out where the headphone jack is and where the camera is and so on.
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:07.740]   Good detective work.
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.460]   No, Gary, that's his actual phone.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.540]   That could have been some staff right now.
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:12.540]   Is that now?
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:13.540]   Could have been a prop.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:15.260]   Yeah, that's an old picture.
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:20.180]   Yes, but that's not that old.
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:23.900]   That's February 2016, less than a year old.
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:26.500]   I just assumed he was using a flip phone.
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:29.020]   No, I remember seeing he had an iPhone.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:33.300]   And then when he said we should boycott Apple, he switched to a Samsung.
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:36.980]   After he tweeted about boycotting Apple from his iPhone.
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:37.980]   Right.
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:38.980]   Well, then he realized I wanted to switch.
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:40.780]   Sorry to hold his days, Ellie, if I didn't switch.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:41.780]   Stay see.
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:42.780]   All right.
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:43.780]   Have a wonderful day.
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:44.780]   Sorry to--
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:45.780]   Bye, you guys.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:46.780]   Good to see you again, Matthew.
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:47.780]   I'll see you too.
[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:52.100]   Tell your daughter it's good to stay after school.
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:54.180]   She's been there for two hours.
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:55.180]   Oh, geez.
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:56.180]   Oh, geez.
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:58.180]   She said a program.
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.180]   She's fine.
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:01.180]   She's not like waiting out.
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:02.180]   She said a program.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:03.180]   Mom.
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:04.900]   She's doing calculus or something.
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:06.340]   She's in her AP statistics.
[01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:07.340]   That's good.
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:08.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:09.340]   Okay.
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:10.340]   Thank you.
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:11.340]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:12.340]   Stacey on IOT.com.
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:14.380]   And of course, the IOT podcast she does with Kevin Tofel.
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:20.180]   @gigastacey on Twitter, where she still reads occasional messages.
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:21.180]   Bye, Stacey.
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:22.180]   Bye.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:23.180]   Ow.
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:24.180]   Okay.
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:30.580]   We're not done because I'm going to keep you around for a little bit longer.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:35.020]   But while we're rearranging the set, let's talk about betterment.
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:39.060]   Mm, a better way to invest.
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:43.780]   Make sure you and your family are set for financial success with betterment.
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.940]   It is the largest independent automated investing service.
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:53.380]   More than a half, five and a half billion dollars now under investment, 180,000 customers.
[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:54.380]   And they're smart.
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.380]   They do it right.
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:59.900]   The portfolio they create for you is designed to achieve optimal results no matter how much
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.060]   you're investing.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:04.740]   And incidentally, there is no minimum to get started.
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:08.660]   Betterment's goal-based investing framework and advice algorithm will let you know if
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:13.060]   you're on track in seconds, whether it's retirement or a rainy day fund.
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:18.980]   They can help you invest at a fraction of what you'd pay for traditional financial services,
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:21.380]   save up to 600% on fees.
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:25.900]   That's important because fees go right off the top of your earnings.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:27.620]   So you're going to keep more of your money.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:31.060]   There's never a trade transaction or rebalancing feed.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:34.740]   You can also sink your outside investments into your betterment dashboard.
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:38.460]   So you'll know exactly where you stand on all your investments.
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:44.580]   If you're planning for retirement, planning for college, this is the way to do it.
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.940]   Through diversification, that's really important.
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:50.940]   They do it better than ever than anybody.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:57.620]   Automated rebalancing, lower fees, you can expect a 4.3% higher return than your typical
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:59.940]   DIY investor.
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:01.420]   They've got smart deposits.
[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:05.940]   I like that because that means I'm saving all the time automatically and automatically
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:08.020]   invest in excess cash.
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:12.060]   You've got a retire guide that provides a consolidated review of your retirement and
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:16.500]   figures out where you stand if you have a retirement gap.
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:21.660]   Every time you make a deposit or receive dividends, betterment will automatically intelligently
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:23.180]   rebalance your portfolio.
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:26.140]   That's one of the most important things you can do on your investment.
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:30.900]   Make sure you're not over long on stocks or long on bonds.
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:33.660]   You want to make sure it's balanced or international.
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:34.980]   It'll do it all for you.
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:38.580]   And because it's end-to-end investing, you get faster cash transfers, tax forms are
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:41.580]   available at the earliest possible date.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:44.380]   And of course, of course, it's completely secure.
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:49.300]   If you need help, support specialists available seven days a week, 365 days a year.
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:52.220]   It's automated, but it's still made of people.
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:55.540]   Smart technology with real people.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:56.940]   Investing involves risk right now.
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:46:04.100]   Get one month managed free when you make an initial deposit of $10,000 or more at betterment.com/twig-betterment.

[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:12.980]   Matthew Ingram is here from fortune.com.
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:18.260]   Always great to have you, Matthew and Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:19.620]   where he teaches journalism.
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:23.780]   He's also a legend on the rubber chicken circuit.
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.100]   I don't know if that's true.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:27.580]   They don't have rubber chicken at Davos.
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:30.220]   It's probably like chicken diavino.
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:34.860]   One dish I had there, the translation didn't want to work.
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:36.820]   They served beef cheekies.
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:39.780]   Sounds good.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:41.780]   I've had beef cheeks.
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.420]   It is quite beef cheekies.
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:44.420]   Cheekies.
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:45.420]   No, cheekies.
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:49.900]   Put them all beneath them now.
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:55.700]   So Twitter, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook have been doing live for a long time.
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:47:02.540]   Instagram next week will be doing live streaming in their stories page.
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:06.260]   Everybody agrees that this is the future.
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:09.740]   I've been doing live streaming for a little longer than that.
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:10.980]   That live streaming is it.
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:18.740]   In fact, I saw an interesting article that's saying a lot of conservative and even alt-right
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:24.820]   publishers are turning to live streaming on Facebook as their own TV channel.
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:27.300]   What's the new Fox News?
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.540]   During the protests in Washington, I'm not talking about the women's march, but there
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:36.700]   were some violent protests independent of the women's march in Washington, D.C.
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:42.420]   A number of alt-right, they talk about one alt-right guy who was streaming live the whole
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:47.300]   time covering it like CNN, but using Facebook to do it.
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:51.100]   Do you remember Trump doing that during the campaign from the Trump Tower?
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.820]   Yeah, right before the debate.
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:59.700]   He had a panel of mistresses, Clinton's mistresses panel.
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:02.820]   That wasn't an all inflammatory.
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:03.820]   No.
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:06.180]   I didn't watch that.
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:08.700]   Has anybody seen that?
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:09.700]   What was that like?
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:14.220]   I can't even imagine what that would have been like.
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:21.220]   I watched one of the Trump TV broadcasts where they had a couple of hosts behind a desk at
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:22.540]   Trump Tower.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:25.700]   They interviewed a Trump surrogate of some kind.
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:29.940]   I wonder, since it was like cable access in the 70s.
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:32.740]   Yeah, it's kind of cheesy, but it's a few ferns or something.
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:34.740]   It's direct.
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:37.060]   It's pretty clear.
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:41.620]   Trump is very much playing to his core in a lot of the things he does.
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.420]   He hasn't been doing this and said the inauguration.
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:46.020]   Will they go back to doing that kind of thing?
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:47.020]   I wonder.
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.020]   Remember he did some YouTube?
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.860]   Quite a few YouTube speeches.
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:51.860]   And definitely Facebook.
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:56.580]   I think Bannon is a big believer in that.
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:49:01.380]   And I think if it's not Breitbart or something like that, then they'd be happy to do their
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:03.020]   own direct stuff.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:05.540]   That's what Trump has said he likes about Twitter.
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.340]   It allows them to do an end run around.
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:09.020]   Every president wants that.
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:12.900]   That's, you know, Reagan did his radio.
[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:15.820]   Every president's wanted FDR started it with Farsight.
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:18.100]   Yeah, but he has Twitter.
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:19.100]   He's better suited.
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:22.700]   But as long as his attention span and he can make his pronouncements and they get quoted
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.700]   all over it.
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:24.700]   It's not easy to quote Twitter.
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:25.700]   They're going to drive the news.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:28.460]   Fact is you do something long on video.
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:32.020]   No, it's not going to drive any news, but it's a tweet everybody can see and respond to
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:33.020]   immediately.
[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:37.740]   In fact, in an interview, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, said he basically checks Twitter
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:43.140]   first thing in the morning to see what Trump tweeted so that he will know what is going
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:44.140]   on.
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:45.140]   Wow.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:49.900]   Well, I asked, I asked a large PR company head in Davos.
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:55.260]   I said, do you have a staff that's up at three in the morning to watch his tweets?
[01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:56.260]   And he said, yes.
[01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:58.860]   Well, you have to.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:02.940]   Every company in America probably has somebody designated to keep an eye on what's going
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.740]   on in the middle of the night.
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:08.100]   Has the president been tweeting though in the middle of the night?
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:11.780]   I think as early as as six o'clock.
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:13.460]   Yeah, not in the middle.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:14.460]   That's what.
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:17.740]   So he used to get a pretty early.
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:21.420]   I saw one story that said he now gets up around six a.m.
[01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:24.860]   watches TV in the residence and then comes down has breakfast off the Oval Office.
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:27.580]   There's a dining room, TV's on there.
[01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:34.100]   And then at nine a.m. comes into the Oval Office office to start taking meetings.
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:35.900]   So now you can start three a.m.
[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:37.660]   West Coast, six a.m. Eastern.
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:38.660]   Exactly.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.660]   Yeah.
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:43.500]   He watches morning Joe apparently for an hour and then switches to Fox and friends.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:49.020]   Well, our good friend, Clayton Morris, is soon to be a good buddy of the president.
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:51.020]   His media consumption habits.
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:57.020]   A close friend said that he believes the New York Post is the paper of record.
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:01.020]   He won't read the Daily News though.
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:02.820]   Oh, no.
[01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:08.620]   Anyway, I started this by talking about the fact that now Twitter, Facebook and Instagram
[01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:13.540]   all are going to have live streaming video and then there's still like his periscope
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:15.300]   and Meerkat went away.
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:20.540]   But there's I mean, it's funny because I read these stories and go, oh, I should do that
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.540]   and they go, oh, never mind.
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:23.540]   I don't.
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:28.420]   The last thing I want to do is stream live video when I go home.
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:35.820]   What I thought was interesting was that digital content next did an analysis of what publishers
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:45.380]   are getting from Facebook and Google and Twitter and I think Snapchat in terms of revenue.
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:51.540]   Because a lot of them have been pouring a lot of resources into Facebook Live and building
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:55.540]   Snapchat teams and doing Google AMP and so on.
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:59.500]   And actually the returns have been fairly meager so far.
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:03.260]   It was surprising to me how little they're actually getting out of that.
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:06.500]   Yeah, but it's a small set of 19.
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:08.980]   You don't know who's in that set.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:12.020]   And a lot of these companies are not going all in.
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:13.620]   They're just testing things.
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:14.620]   So it's interesting.
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:15.620]   Yes, I agree.
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:20.140]   But I don't think it's terribly indicative of the potential.
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:27.420]   Interesting move by Mark Zuckerberg's charitable foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:29.100]   They acquired this.
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:34.580]   This is actually I think is really great, a science and search engine called meta.
[01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:38.220]   Scientific journals are an interesting thing that most cases the research is public research
[01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:40.980]   paid with public dollars or university money.
[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:45.740]   But it's often behind a paywall, often a very expensive paywall where other scientists
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:48.780]   and researchers don't have easy access to it.
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:51.740]   In fact, this was what got Jonathan Schwartz in so much trouble.
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:58.940]   He wrote a little tool to suck one of the paid journal repositories.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:03.140]   I can't remember which one was it LexisNexis, one of them dry at MIT and they got that's
[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:08.420]   what got him arrested and eventually led to his trial and suicide.
[01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:10.220]   Meta is an interesting one.
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:15.820]   They bought it and they're going to make it available as a free tool.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:22.260]   It's a search engine, it uses artificial intelligence optimized for scientific research.
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:28.660]   So, the goal they say of Chan Zuckerberg's initiative's goal is to break down some of
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:32.420]   the barriers that preclude the sharing of information.
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:35.260]   They're buying encouraging scientific progress.
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:37.100]   I wish they had funded SciHub.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.780]   Have you heard of that?
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:42.020]   No, is that another one or is that the open one?
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:47.380]   SciHub is basically the pirate bay of academic journals.
[01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:55.820]   It's got 48 million journal articles that have been liberated from Kazakhstan.
[01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:57.820]   Wow.
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:59.380]   It's quite the venture.
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:03.220]   If you believe in academic freedom or freedom of information.
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:04.580]   It's bad for society.
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:11.660]   It seems criminal that these companies are monetizing research that was paid for by taxpayers.
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:19.380]   In some cases, I think government agencies have made it a condition that if grant money
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:23.060]   funds research, it has to be made public.
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:28.300]   Let me just real quickly look at the Aaron Schwartz story.
[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:30.180]   I'm trying to remember.
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:31.380]   Jay Store was the one.
[01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:35.940]   He had a guest at MIT and he used it to attempt to-
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:38.740]   He hooked his laptop up to his server.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:39.940]   To image it.
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:42.660]   You know, free it.
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:45.540]   Free the journals.
[01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:49.660]   Anything else you guys want to talk about before we get to tips and numbers and tools?
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:52.500]   No, I think we did.
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:58.700]   I thought it was interesting that Facebook has made some changes to trending topics.
[01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:04.100]   They continue to try and tweak how that functions.
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:10.500]   Now you will no longer get personalized trending topics, which I thought was interesting.
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:12.940]   Is that mean they're no longer algorithmic?
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:16.660]   No, they'll be algorithmic to some extent.
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.820]   It'll be the same.
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:19.820]   I'll wick away.
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:25.860]   By which I mean the algorithm, kind of non-algorithm could just be one of the most reshared articles
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:26.860]   algorithmic.
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:27.860]   Or on some formula.
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:31.020]   But I still think it's a crappy feature.
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:35.060]   They also, what they did something they think was designed to make the quality better, which
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:40.860]   was they're not just going to make a trend if it's the most shared.
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:47.740]   They're going to look at the most shared articles from a range of sort of professional
[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:48.740]   sources.
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:50.740]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:55.660]   Hopefully, I think they're hoping that we'll get rid of some of the news articles from
[01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:58.980]   the website that the Matchedonian teens put together.
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:55:59.980]   You know, that didn't exist.
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:00.980]   You're right, Matthew.
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:04.500]   If I look down, oh, the third one down, right, Bart?
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:05.820]   Well, bright, bright, bright.
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:09.820]   Be sure to hoesorgon the White House down.
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:13.860]   Oxt news, USA Today, USA Today, USA Today, USA Today, USA Today, USA Today, USA Today.
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:17.100]   Patch, I'm getting just a little bit of a minute.
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:20.660]   I'm just waiting to make man who's been right in the middle of her confirmation hearings.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:21.660]   Constance, woo.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:23.460]   I think this is still big.
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:25.860]   I'm looking at the sources, not the.
[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:26.860]   Oh, the sources.
[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:28.980]   Queen of Peace is my first one.
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:30.700]   No, you're different.
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:32.220]   Chelsea Clinton is next.
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:39.860]   Joss Whedon next, Linda McMahon, 2017 Ford GT, Rafa Nadell, Tim Daly, Ernest Borgnine,
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:42.780]   John Elway and Cards Against Humanity.
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:43.780]   Doesn't mind.
[01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:46.700]   Have you been shopping for Ford GTs by any chance?
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:48.180]   I don't know.
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:52.740]   Do I look like a GT driver?
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.740]   You can't do.
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:05.140]   Do you have anything, Matthew Ingram, you want to pick as a pick of the week of any kind?
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:06.140]   Pick of the week.
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:09.860]   Anything you like these days, you want to talk about?
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:14.580]   Mine, my flame doubt last week, none of them worked.
[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:15.580]   What do you mean?
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:16.580]   None of them work.
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:20.980]   I was like, one of them was a website, a YouTube website that did little clips, random clips
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:23.820]   of videos that hadn't been viewed ever.
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:24.820]   Zero views.
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:25.820]   Zero views.
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:27.700]   It was really cool.
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:28.700]   Didn't work?
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:29.700]   No, I don't.
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:30.700]   In fact, what was it?
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:32.100]   Do you remember what it was, Carsten?
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:34.460]   Because I could go, or Carsten's not here.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:38.700]   I could go back to it and see if it's working now.
[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:43.340]   Because it was a really, it was like as if you're viewing it from space.
[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:49.420]   If you were viewing the planet Earth and you just had a magic camera that would let you
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:53.300]   see what was going on.
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:54.300]   That sounds interesting.
[01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:59.140]   Yeah, I really liked it, but it didn't work.
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:04.580]   Did you ever see that site that just aggregated webcams that had the default password?
[01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:05.820]   Yes.
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:07.220]   That's still around.
[01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:08.220]   Show Dan.
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:09.820]   That's a great site.
[01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:11.580]   Lots of, lots of site.
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:14.260]   Watch YouTube videos with zero views.
[01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:16.740]   Apparently, that's a very, very, uh...
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:17.740]   Have you seen Lion?
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:18.900]   No, what's Lion?
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:20.900]   It's a movie about...
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:21.900]   Oh, the movie.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:23.900]   Yeah, no, I don't want to see that.
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:24.900]   Dev Petzel, yeah.
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:25.900]   You're too.
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:26.900]   It's fantastic.
[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:27.900]   It's a really, really...
[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:28.900]   A lot of Oscar nominations.
[01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:29.900]   All right.
[01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:30.900]   You will probably cry a lot.
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:31.900]   It's so...
[01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:32.900]   So I hear.
[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:34.580]   Yeah, but it's extremely well done.
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:37.060]   But you know what struck me when I was watching it?
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:42.700]   I remember when that story came out that he had found his village on Google Earth.
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:46.820]   And you know, Google Earth was relatively new at the time.
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:50.620]   And I remember thinking to myself, I remember thinking this even when Google Earth first
[01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:56.820]   came out and everyone in my office was looking at their street or whatever.
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:59:01.740]   I just remember thinking that it was one of the most, one of those moments when you stop
[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:06.180]   and you think that you're living in the future, that it was so...
[01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:07.180]   Yeah.
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:09.900]   I don't know, it just seemed so...
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:10.900]   Yeah.
[01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:11.900]   Sci-fi.
[01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:16.140]   It just seemed so futuristic that I didn't think it could possibly be happening, let alone
[01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:19.780]   be free for you to zoom in on anywhere on the globe.
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:21.180]   And now we're so used to it.
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:23.740]   You know, I was watching the movie and I was thinking, "Man, that looks like crap.
[01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:25.140]   The interface is terrible.
[01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:26.860]   You can't do street view.
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:27.860]   The buildings aren't 3D."
[01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:32.340]   And I've gotten so used to zooming in on everything.
[01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:34.700]   Everything is amazing and nobody's happy, right?
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:35.700]   Right.
[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:36.700]   Right.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:37.700]   But I mean, it is my fun.
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:38.700]   Like Wi-Fi on the plane.
[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:41.140]   Our ability to do that is fantastic.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:45.700]   We live in the remarkable times and we take them totally for granted, obviously.
[01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:48.380]   That's why we should all be happy.
[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:51.740]   We're all be happy.
[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:52.980]   Happy, happy, happy.
[01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:55.020]   What's your number of the week, Jeff Jarvis?
[01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:57.260]   Well, I lost most of them, but I got one left.
[01:59:57.260 --> 01:59:58.860]   Oh, you mean we used them?
[01:59:58.860 --> 01:59:59.860]   They do this one for me.
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:00.860]   Okay, that's all right.
[02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:01.860]   That's all right.
[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:05.260]   Oh, we didn't do how many ads Google News killed, Google killed.
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:06.260]   It was on 16.
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:07.260]   Oh, that's a good one.
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:08.260]   Did we do that?
[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:09.260]   No, we did not do it.
[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:10.260]   All right, good.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:16.100]   It killed 1.7 billion ads, including fake news ads.
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:17.100]   Whoa.
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:18.100]   Oh.
[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:24.780]   Now, I remember the payday loan ads, they killed all of those.
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:31.700]   68 million unapproved pharmaceuticals, 80 million for deceiving and shocking users, 5
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:33.100]   million payday loans.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.140]   But I like those ads.
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:36.340]   The shocking ones.
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:41.340]   Quick, quick ads continue malware, 112 million.
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:42.860]   Oh my God, wait a minute.
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:44.620]   That's a significant number.
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:47.700]   112 million ads containing malware.
[02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:48.700]   Now where?
[02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:49.700]   Yep.
[02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:50.700]   Wow.
[02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:51.700]   Wow.
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:58.140]   And 1,300 for so-called tabloid cloaking, which is their odd phrase for fake news.
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:00.500]   And that they admit is going to go up this year.
[02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:01.980]   That's a tiny number, actually.
[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:05.300]   Yeah, these are just ads, mind you.
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.900]   They're blocked to publishers too, didn't they?
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:11.220]   I think that was more effective where they said to the Macedonian kids, you can't use
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:12.220]   ads since anymore.
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:15.220]   Yeah, they blocked some of the 200 publishers.
[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:16.220]   Yeah.
[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:17.220]   Because those-
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:21.300]   That's really how that stuff works is that if you can't monetize it, they could go to other
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:22.300]   places.
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:23.300]   Right.
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:24.300]   That was the whole reason why they did it.
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:25.300]   Right.
[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:28.580]   So that they like they care about Trump or Clinton.
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:29.580]   Well good for Google.
[02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:30.580]   Yep.
[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:31.580]   So that's my number.
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:32.580]   Yep.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:33.580]   A good number.
[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:37.180]   It's kind of self-serving, one of our advertisers.
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:44.300]   But the Ring Video Doorbell just raised a third round of funding, valuing them at $200
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:45.300]   million.
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:46.300]   What was the size of the fund?
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:50.700]   Round, I think it was $100 million round adventure funding.
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:52.580]   So good for good on Ring.
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:54.660]   They're really knocking it out of the park.
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:55.660]   I did not know this.
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:02:02.300]   They did a deal with a neighborhood in Los Angeles with the police department there to
[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:07.580]   put Ring doorbells on one in ten houses in the area to cut crime.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:08.580]   Oh.
[02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:10.580]   With apparently good effect.
[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:11.580]   That's pretty cool.
[02:02:11.580 --> 02:02:12.580]   I think that's really neat.
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:13.580]   Yeah, bravo.
[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:14.580]   Yeah.
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:22.100]   They raised- We had mentioned, I think I'd mentioned in the ads, that $28 million from
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:23.860]   Richard Branson was their first round.
[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:31.700]   But since then they had a second round of funding from Goldman Sachs and Qualcomm Ventures.
[02:02:31.700 --> 02:02:37.260]   And now they're on a Series D round, $109 million additional investment.
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:39.900]   So I think that's what I'm about to mention.
[02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:40.900]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:42.900]   Have you heard of a 6D DB?
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:43.900]   No, what's that?
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:49.940]   So I wrote about them just recently at Fortune.
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:52.380]   It's an audio startup.
[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:59.100]   And the thing, the news hook for the piece I wrote about was that they have integrated
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:02.380]   with the Echo.
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:08.860]   And basically they bring in not just all the podcasts you might want from NPR and all
[02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:12.580]   the usual sources, but a whole range of audio.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:16.580]   So they actually take the audio from video clips.
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:24.140]   If you like Seth Meyer's segment on his show, you can get just the audio of that.
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:28.740]   And you can basically control that through the Echo.
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:37.140]   So you can walk around your house and say, "Give me the news from the top kind of sources
[02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:38.140]   that 6D DB has."
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:39.140]   And it's just--
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:40.140]   It's on my screen here.
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:41.140]   Yeah.
[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:42.140]   It's--
[02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:43.140]   This is--
[02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:44.140]   I thought it was--
[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:45.140]   Really?
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:46.140]   So it's like it's--
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:47.140]   I don't have shows.
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:48.140]   Yeah.
[02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:52.460]   And regular podcasts and pretty much anything audio they're trying to get.
[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:56.180]   You can do it on the internet, but they also have an iOS app.
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:57.180]   Yeah.
[02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:59.420]   And you can do it on the internet now.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:02.020]   And the app and the Echo coordinate, obviously.
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:08.540]   So if you leave your house, you can seamlessly move it from the Echo to your phone.
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:11.700]   So I'm going to pick these subjects.
[02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:12.700]   And oh, this is great.
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:14.180]   So it's basically--
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:20.660]   It's two of the co-founders were early employees of Netflix, including one of the guys who
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:23.060]   came up with their recommendation engine.
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:27.460]   And so they're hoping to do something similar for audio.
[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:32.380]   So it's an Echo skill that I could say, OK, listen to 6D DB or something like that?
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:33.380]   Yeah.
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:34.380]   Yeah.
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:36.780]   I'm just signing up right now.
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:37.780]   I'm just signing up right now.
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:38.780]   I'm excited.
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:39.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:40.780]   Because I don't have one, but--
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:41.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:42.780]   That sounds really great.
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:43.780]   I should probably go.
[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:44.780]   We're going to let you go.
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:46.100]   We're going to let Matthew Ingram go.
[02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:48.820]   We're going to let everybody go.
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:52.580]   Because we have come to the end of this show.
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:54.900]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:57.940]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.
[02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:00.860]   Buzzmachine.com is his blog at Jeff Jarvis.
[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:03.580]   We didn't get to talk about Medium today, but we'll talk about some next--
[02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:04.580]   Oh, that's right.
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:05.580]   Yeah.
[02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:06.580]   Yeah, we will.
[02:05:06.580 --> 02:05:08.080]   What's going on there?
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:13.020]   By the way, I noticed Twitbits is in the 60 DB.co.
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:14.020]   We got it.
[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:16.780]   I had it pick some technology stuff, and I'm in there.
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:17.780]   So that's good.
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:18.780]   Right.
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:20.980]   Like that, your next gaming PC might be a notebook.
[02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:22.540]   Look at that.
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:25.380]   This was generated for me automatically.
[02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:28.780]   This is really cool.
[02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:30.580]   And there are windows-weekly's in there, too.
[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:32.580]   I guess they must like what we do.
[02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:35.380]   I'm sure there's some twig in here somewhere.
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:36.620]   Where are we?
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:37.620]   Yeah.
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:38.620]   Yeah, where's Twig?
[02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:42.220]   Well, it's using Twitbits, which is smart because we pre-edit those to down to a few
[02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:43.220]   minutes.
[02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:44.220]   Yeah, that's better.
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:45.220]   That makes sense.
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:46.220]   Yeah.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:51.340]   Matthew Ingram's at Fortune, where he's an editor covering the world, and you've got
[02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:57.340]   to read them regularly at Matthew, I, M-A-T-H-E-W-I, or it could be math.
[02:05:57.340 --> 02:06:00.340]   Ooey on the Twitter.
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:01.340]   It could be.
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:02.340]   It could be.
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:03.340]   Math.
[02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:04.340]   Ewy.
[02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:05.340]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:07.340]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday.
[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:09.300]   It's kind of my last show of my week.
[02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:11.780]   My weekend is tomorrow on Friday.
[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:13.860]   I know you don't care about that.
[02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:18.180]   I just threw that in as a personal note to make you think I'm a normal human being.
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:25.180]   We do this show 130 p.m. Pacific, 430 p.m. Eastern Time, 2130 UTC, Twitter.tv, or YouTube.com/live,
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:27.780]   or on your Roku or your Apple TV, or one of the Twitter apps.
[02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.420]   There's lots of ways to watch live.
[02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:32.660]   If you do, please join us in the chatroom at IRC.tv.
[02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:38.820]   But of course, you can watch at your leisure anytime by just downloading a show.
[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:42.580]   In fact, what I do is I would subscribe if I were you.
[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:47.260]   Just visit your favorite podcast application and look for Twig.
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:48.580]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:51.020]   See you next time on this week at Google.
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:51.540]   Bye bye.
