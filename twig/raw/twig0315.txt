[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google why some German chefs don't want you to take pictures of their food.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Is it all over for Google now? And what about Facebook M? Plus I'll give you a report on what happened to my stylist when I stuck it in the wrong way.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Twig.

[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And it's a lot more than Google as always, but we're going to have a great time today because Mike Elgin is in-house. I always love that when our News Director from TNT joins us.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Mike is a Google+ fanatic. I prefer freak if that's okay.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Okay. And the best dressed man in this studio today. Nice to see you again, Mike.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   See you. We thought Jeff Jarvis wouldn't be here because you had an all-day event at Q&A.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You're hoping not, but I'm sticky. You can't get rid of me.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I believe my response to your warning was, "Oh no! We can't do this show with that, Jeff Jarvis."
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I'm glad you're here. How'd it go? It was good. I had a conference on media and membership.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You're a membership? What does that mean?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   It means a bunch of sneeze. Go ahead, sneeze.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   You can't do it like command. As soon as... Oh, there we go. That was satisfying for me.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   So it just means that it's a new way to have a new relationship with your public and get them to be members.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And what that means and all membership means today is give me your money.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And we want to push the definition beyond that. Yes. That's enough.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   We don't ask for people's money. We just ask for something a lot more valuable. They're attention.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   They're devotion. They're devotion. They're long.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And if they want to give us some money, we'll take that too.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Ron Amario is here from Mars Technica. Great to have you. He's the...
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   What's up?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Android guy. And thank you for retweeting my woes.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That video was perfect. I will get into it later.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   But that was the exact same reaction I had just offline, you know, before...
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Did you do the same thing? When I first saw it? Oh, yeah. I did exactly the same thing.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That's why I wrote the article because you read it.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And you're like, "Yeah, whatever." And then it happens to you and you're like, "Oh my God."
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's exactly. It all starts with Android Central and Jeff Nickinson's column in which he points out...
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   No pun intended.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   ...that you feel Nickinson. I'm sorry. You should not put in your stylist the wrong way in the pen.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And he really kind of... I wish I'd read this first.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   As usual with most people, I read the headline and kind of the synopsis.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And I didn't get to this line. The S Pen goes into the five point first.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Do not put it in, but first it will get stuck in uppercase.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And I read that. I might have been less likely to do what I did on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Here's the video of it actually because it was very easy to do that.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Oh, I just did it. Oh crap.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And that's their official stance is RTFM.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   It's not easy.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It does use any...
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   He's crazy. He's crazy.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Did you just do it?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   No, he went and withdraw the stylist.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   It... I thought... because it went in so easily, I thought, "Oh, this isn't going to be a problem to get it out."
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Oh my God.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   The clippers closed down on it apparently.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   They did.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So you did that two run?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's so easy.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Isn't it? It's... that's what's deceiving about it.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   It goes in just without any effort. It just goes right in.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   It is zero force and yeah, it just kind of clamps down.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   It's exactly the same feeling as like using a Chinese finger trap.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Or like you put your fingers in and then you try to go out and all of a sudden,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   there's this force that wasn't there before. It's really weird.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Some people report, and I think you reported this in your article, that you can do it again and maybe fix it.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Yeah, I got mine out without it being broken.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Oh, you...
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So I...
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   How'd you do it?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I just... I put it in there and wiggled it out and the first time I got it out, it didn't work.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And then I got it stuck again.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Yes!
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I just pulled it out again, right, and then it worked.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So you think if I stick it in again, there's a chance I'll fix it?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Yeah, I think.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Go for it, you know.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   You haven't done that yet.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   You haven't done that yet.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   You haven't done that yet.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's a disaster here, Leo.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So let me tell you what happens.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   As Mac Break Weekly ended, I had a phone that... this is the note five, by the way.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I had a phone that had a pen sticking out, kind of like an antenna on the bottom.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And I went to AT&T because that's where I bought it from AT&T.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   $850, it was not a cheap phone.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And I know you pay for full board.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yeah, I buy the phones.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   So... and I could... you know, it is a little bit annoying because there's no... if you're
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   going to buy it in the US, you have to buy it from a carrier, you know, with an incumbent
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   to your contract and all that stuff.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   But that's the way it is.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And I didn't want to wait for the unlocked version.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I've in the past, I've bought unlocked international galaxies.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And that's kind of always been a mistake.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So this was a mistake too, as it turned out, because AT&T didn't want to have anything
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   to do with it.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Oh, really?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Well, I said, can I... so the guy said, well, that's intentional damage.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   We're not going to fix that.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   No.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   So is it going to speak?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Yeah, so I said, can I speak to a manager?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And he would... you know, he said, yeah, you know, you could say... Samsung has a one-year
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   warranty.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   You probably could send it to them.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And then I said, okay, well, I like this phone.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I don't want to lose it.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Now, it's only a week old.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Could I just give it back?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   He said, yeah, you could do that, but you can't do it in this state.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   You have to pull the pen out, put it back in.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I said, but you know that will break it.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And he didn't... I think what he was implying is, well, we wouldn't know that.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So, because the breaking, by the way, I should point out, and you know this run, the breaking
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   isn't that big a deal.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   The breaking only means that it doesn't sense the pen sliding out, so it doesn't go into
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   that off-screen notation mode.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I can still use the pen in every respect.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Right, yeah.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Well, and the little menu doesn't pop out automatically.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   No, but if you press the button in hover, it pops out, so it's not the end of the world.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Well, I mean, the stylus is supposed to be the big differentiator on these things, so I mean,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I don't know which...
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It's not the end of the world, but it's still the end of the $800.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Not still gone.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I mean, the phone works in every other respect.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   The air command works, you just have to press the button on the stylus now.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It turns out that's not actually it.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It isn't.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   So, this is a little deceptive.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   That hook is the spring hook that you press so it'll pop out.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   There is an even...
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Ah, I see this comes out.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   On here, there's an even tinier, little tiny plastic hook below that that gets caught in
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   one of the ridges of the pen and snaps off.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Now, apparently what happened to you, Ron, is that that got pushed up, but you were
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   able to pull it back down and you were lucky.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah, that's a great picture, though.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I've had people send me stuff about, "Oh, this happened to me, too."
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And somebody broke the top right off and it stayed in the device.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And they just have...
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It broke off just above the G and...
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Ooh.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   So...
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   But he said he talked to Samsung and they replaced it.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So, Samsung hasn't said too much about this.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Their response was, "Well, you should have read the manual, but it doesn't come with a manual."
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   No, it just not.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Their response...
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   But there's an online PDF that does say, and by the way, this is a mistake on their part,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   very clearly not to do this, right?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And it might break the phone.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   That which is an admission that they knew before the phone was shipped, that this was the case.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   What about those videos you always see at the...
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   We do this a thousand times to make sure it's always more.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   We dropped on it.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   We did all this good stuff.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Jesus.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Would Apple have done this?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Well, my initial thought went...
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Oh, would have laughed and would have blamed you.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Well, but when I left the AT&T store, I was thinking, had I bought an iPhone and something like that happen,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Apple would have just swapped it.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Kind of no questions, ask.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Well, well, but if the...
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   No, no, the difference is this.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   The product as a whole has a flaw.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Apple's first response in the past has been...
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   That's how you're holding the phone.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Imagine how expensive this will be to fix if they try to fix it.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Well, how many units are out though?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Oh, that we don't know.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Maybe they sold 10.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I don't know.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   This is a superb phone and one of the things I'm unhappy, I don't want to give this up.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   So I can live with...
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I did break it, so I can live with it being broken.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I suspect they'll fix this flaw in future ones and if you bought one in a week or a month, it will be fixed.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   But I don't know what they're going to do for us early adopters.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I don't...
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Yeah, I mean, if you permanently... if you break the little sensor thing off, then you would need a replacement, I think.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I wonder if there's some kind of alternate stylist design that they could ship out to existing customers that wouldn't get stuck because this is a holoplastic too.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   This doesn't really cost any money.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Right.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I'm sure they could come up with something maybe.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So here's the illustration from 9 to 5 Google.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   It's really a...
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It's a little technical...
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   A little kind of a technical illustration.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   But so this lever too, the first lever up at the top is actually the...
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   You know, not the lever that gets broken.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   That's not the sensor lever.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   This little notch in the pen apparently gets caught in a much smaller...
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   There it is.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   You can barely see it.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   A sensor here.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   That's the present sensor.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And there's a tiny little black piece of plastic there and I guess that's what's on mine snapped off.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Yours works though, which is interesting.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Yeah, I think there's a state that it can be in where you remove it and it won't work anymore and you put it back in and it will maybe go to a state that does work and then you can remove it.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Should I do that Ron?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Is that your recommendation?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   You could try.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I mean, it's already broken.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Well, I could break it worse.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I could break it worse.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I could break it worse.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   See, the thing is I expected...
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   So this is my natural...
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   suspicion of tech blogs is...
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Oh, you know, they're overblowing this.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   You probably had to press harder to get it to do that.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And what I didn't understand is it just went in very... without any pressure at all.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And it just happens if you pass a certain point you're done for.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And so now when you put it in... but now you have no fear of which way you put it in because it's...
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Well, I think I do.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   It's still broken the same way.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I think I do.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I'll get mine, Janth again.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I wonder if we just drop it.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Oh, no, run. No, no, no, no, no!
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Just drop it.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Do it, run.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Straight up gravity.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I wonder if it will get stuck.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   See?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   You see how easy that went in?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Ha!
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   That's the demonstration.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   That's the demonstration.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   That's the critical demonstration.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Right there.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   That's why I was surprised.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Gravity is sufficient.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And that's why I think they have a little bit of a problem.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Because you could see a kid doing this or in the dark.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I'm not really paying attention.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   It'd be an easy thing.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Oh, he's a tension of which way you're going to put it in.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Exactly.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Oh, I--
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Since you'd be able to go in any which way you want to put it in.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I would hold--
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   God, you win.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I would hope everybody now would pay attention.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I think what's--
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Even more interesting is that previous notes prevented this.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   This one does not.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   This could not happen.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I don't understand why.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   All they really had to do was make the flat end just a tiny bit wider than the rest of the entire pin.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And that would prevent all of that.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   They wanted it to be flush on the bottom, right?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   This is a brand new stylus design that has this kind of spring-loaded pop-out thing.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Oh, you got it out?
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Did you get it out, Ron?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Have you got it out?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Yeah, I just kind of--
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   And is it working?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Is the sensor working?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Uh...
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   No.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   So you broke it.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   You did it for us, though.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Oh, maybe.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   It did this before, though, and I put it back in and kind of messed around with it, and it
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   works again.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   So...
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   It's very telling that he just let that go.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   The gravity was--
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   What he's willing to do for his pub-art.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   It's just working.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   It's working.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   You fixed it.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Okay, we're good.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   We're good.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   You fixed it.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And that's the one thing that doesn't work anymore is--on mine is that kind of cool feature, but not one.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I call it the "write a girl's number down in the bar" feature.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It's not something I'm going to do.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Can I ask a different question about the phone?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   How is the state of Samsung bloatware much better?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Is it?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I think this is my--until then, this is my favorite phone right now.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   I'm waiting--it's better than--I'm waiting for the Moto X Pure.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   That's coming out and--well, you can order it.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   The next time.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   That's going to be cool.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   September 3rd.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   And I'm waiting to see what the next I are.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Because I'm--you know what?
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Google Fi has turned out to be a real money saver for me.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Really?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   So it's 20 bucks for unlimited voice and text, and then $10 per gigabyte for data.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Right.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   But I--it was only 30 bucks last month.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Because I didn't use it--because I--most of the data is on Wi-Fi.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   So I could see that being a real savings.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Because it could be as little as 20 bucks.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   If you don't--if you only in Wi-Fi, you only use 20 bucks.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Plus, if you leave the country for a month, you can turn it off and come back and you don't--
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   If I'm not fond of the Nexus 6, I think it's a little large.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   This is 5.7.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   It's just right.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   What do you think, Ron?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Do you like this phone?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   It's wildly expensive.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   I mean, it's $100 to $800.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And it's more than $800 which kills me.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Yeah, especially when you compare that to, you know, Samsung's Nightmare, Xiaomi is selling--if
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   you've ever played with a Xiaomi E-Note, those are like $400 or $500, I think.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Right.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So I really don't see the $300 worth of extra value here.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   I mean, it's a great device.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   It's like the most premium note Samsung's ever built.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   You know, you're not going to be able to take the battery out or do an SD card or whatever.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   The build quality is great.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   The camera's great.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   It has a fingerprint reader and all that stuff.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   It's just--it's just priced the way I feel like you priced cell phones a couple years ago.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   And now everybody's kind of dropped prices in Samsung.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   You know what's ironic, though?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   That's in the Android world.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Apple's not going to drop its prices.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   No, they don't have to.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   There's no--
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Well, there's no--
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Well, there's no--
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Well, there's no--
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   It's competition for an iOS device.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   It's about the ecosystem.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's just--
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   So Ron, I'm so glad you're on the show because I want to ask you something.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   The Huawei Nexus, you wrote about this, has the weird, like, protruding camera stuff, right?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And it's very conspicuous looking.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   It's probably just a lot of camera electronics that they couldn't quite cram in there.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   But what--
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Look at that bump.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   But what are the chances that this is Project Tango?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   There's a picture of a case on there, too.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   And it covers everything other than the--
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   So there's a case, and they make these cases to the manufacturer spec, basically.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   They say, "We need cut out here, here, and here."
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   So the only cutouts there at the top are the camera, the flash, and that little extra
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   thing must be a laser autofocus.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   So--
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   So it's not like this?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   It's just extra stuff.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I think a lot of that bump is-- it's a plastic window to get signals out because the majority
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   of the phone is metal.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Explain what Tango is so people understand why that's important.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   OK, so Project Tango is Google's invention for 3D mapping in real time of indoor and outdoor
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   spaces with a smartphone or a tablet.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   So you could buy a Tango tablet, is what they're selling right now?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   They're selling out the inside of your store.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   You could do it for games, for augmented reality.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   There's lots of applications for it which--
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   In blind?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Exactly.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And it's amazing technology--
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   But it's a big-ass tablet, right?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   It's a big-ass tablet, and the electronics for that used to exist in very expensive desktop
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   computers.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Google managed to get it down into a mobile form factor.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   This thing is not coming out to the end of the year, at the earliest, I understand.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And so it occurred to me that since the tablet's already out there, and of course, this was first
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   demonstrated on smartphones, this could be their first on-try, given that it's an
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   excess and so on.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   But yeah, it doesn't seem likely to me either at this point.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Yeah, Tango needs sensors.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   It's a 3D sensor.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It's basically like slapping an Xbox Kinect on the back of your device.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And it needs a camera here and then over here.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   So you get two different angles, like a stereo view kind of.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   So you'd need a hole on the other side, and there isn't one so now.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   So why do they need so much space for this camera electronics?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Everybody else is cramming, for the most part, the camera electronics into the cases that
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   are shipping.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Why do they need so much extra room?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   It looks a little bit like the Lumia 1020.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   That was their 41 megapixel camera in a Windows phone, and it had a fairly hefty bump around
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   the lens.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Yeah, Huawei likes to build the thinnest possible devices.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   If you look at some of their stuff, big camera bumps like this are always kind of their thing.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.600]   I think it was more a design decision than anything else to take what is normally a camera
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.000]   bump and kind of extend it across the whole back of the device.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.200]   Maybe they'll put the bigger components up there and make the phone as thin as possible.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.000]   But I mean, everything, all phones have camera bumps.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   And Huawei, I think, just chose to take theirs and go all the way across it.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   It's a camera stripe instead of a bump.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Yeah, you're going to see bumps because to get low light performance in a phone camera,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   you need more lens elements.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Everybody's touting six elements, seven elements.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I think the new Apple phone will have seven elements.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   So that necessitates a bump.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   You just can't put seven layers of plastic in there without some protrusion.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And better to bump that the whole phone.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Yeah, I think that's an ugly choice.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   But, you know, I don't know.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   I don't care about phone thickness.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I'd rather they make the whole thing.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   And give me more battery.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.080]   And like this thing looks ugly, but we've seen renders of it before that match this design
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.000]   that used white cutouts on the top and bottom.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And it looked way better.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   It's just the contrasty plastic thing makes it look like a, I don't know, like a vent or
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   a one of those things that are shipped for talking to people below deck.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Right.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Exactly.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Full speed ahead.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Ridley.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   All right.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   All right.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   So enough.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I don't want to step too much in all about Android toes here.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   You guys do such a great job every Tuesday evening, 5 p.m.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern with our steam Jason.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   How was the host?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   We actually didn't talk about the wall annexes last night.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   So there you go.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.280]   You didn't step on toes at all.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.000]   This is the render actually at the or one of the renders anyways.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   That was better.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.400]   What you were talking about.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   Doesn't matter.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   It's all made up.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   Yes, exactly.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.440]   It's all completely unofficial at this point.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.840]   We don't even know if Wally is actually actually a boy.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.840]   Actually, even officially.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.680]   Wouldn't it be weird if Google used a Chinese company to make Nexus?
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.880]   I think that's a funny one.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.520]   We only used Chinese company to make the thing, the router.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.520]   Oh, the on hub?
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.520]   That's right.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.520]   TP link.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.520]   Sure.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.520]   Everybody uses Chinese companies for a...
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.320]   No, Chinese manufacture, but to actually use a...
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.440]   And isn't Wally partly owned by the Chinese military?
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.920]   I mean, this is not just some random...
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   This is...
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   Well, I give you...
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   It gives me pause.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.920]   A few of those.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.600]   Oh, Wally is a massive company.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.920]   If you go to like, CVS or Mobile World Congress, they have the biggest truth there.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:10.880]   And they make everything from, I think, like, satellites to cell phone towers to a million
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.880]   different other products.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.120]   So it's not just cell phones, but I think the point is that Google wants to take Huawei
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.400]   and say, "This is an okay brand and you can pay attention to this company."
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.040]   And I think they want to elevate them with a Nexus...
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.520]   Well, and on Huawei's part, they've never been able to get in the US market.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.200]   So they would love to get in the US market, right?
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.960]   Maybe that's the beginning for them as well.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.240]   Not LG, you think.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.040]   LG won't make this.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.200]   Oh, the 6-inch one?
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   Is it LG making...
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.000]   Oh, they're making the Nexus 5.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.840]   Yeah, they're making a 5.2-inch device.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840]   And so this is a 6-inch device.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.840]   They both kind of share a lot in common, but yeah.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   It has a nice...
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.600]   Well, 5-something, which says...
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   I don't really...
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.600]   Well, it's all rumors, but it's short.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.600]   Right.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600]   But yeah, it's weird.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.520]   It's basically like the iPhone 6 and 6+ model, but from two completely different manufacturers.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.680]   And they kind of share a design and a lot of design styles.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:13.280]   Like they both have the rear fingerprint sensor, they both have front-facing stereo speakers,
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.200]   kind of similar designs.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.760]   It'll be interesting.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.760]   Google is...
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:25.040]   Google, by the way, Huawei makes cell-site equipment that's used in the United States.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.160]   Ronald was talking about their big booths at Mobile World Congress.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.440]   They had bouncers to keep the press out.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.440]   Really?
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.440]   Out.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.440]   Not in.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.440]   Out.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.440]   It was unbelievable.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   Wow.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.440]   It was a real conference.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:44.280]   And you had to like NFC badge in and yeah, that was fun.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.160]   So when are you getting your Google on Hub, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   You got yours from...
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   Well, Walmart lies.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.160]   Oh, Walmart lied.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.160]   Surprise.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.120]   So Walmart said expected the September 11th, you know, a week later, it's still not ship
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   or anything, of course.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.000]   Let me see if I have any...
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.760]   So the first time I've already...
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.560]   Walmart, all I've got in a spam.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.560]   Wow.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   Wow.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.320]   I don't have tracking information.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.320]   I got it from...
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   Thanks for your recent order.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.320]   You'll love these things too.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.120]   You'll have to look back from them.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.120]   So Google...
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.120]   No way to track it.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.040]   I ordered it from the Google Store and it says October 1st through 5th.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.920]   But Ronald was a mistake, the Google Store.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.720]   Is that the worst place to get it?
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.720]   What?
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   Really?
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   Oh, Google's retail is so out of whack.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   No.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.880]   I had an order from Amazon that was going to show up September 2nd, but then Google said
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.200]   they were going to ship me once.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   Just call Google customer service.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.520]   Just a kept in order, I would have bought it from Iran.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.240]   Google's having an event today in San Francisco, which we were not invited to.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.240]   Thank you, Google.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   Bastards.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.440]   Didn't even tell us about it.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.440]   Bastards.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:49.160]   And it's the on hub show off thing.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.080]   Does ours have somebody there?
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.080]   Yes.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   Of course they do.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.160]   I'm going to get one FedEx over here.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:05.520]   I think Google would know that in fact broadcast media is as good as blog media, web media.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520]   Blog blogs.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   He spat that.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   Blog.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.080]   That's the blog.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.080]   Tech blogs.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.360]   Those kids get your blog off by.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.160]   You know, we had to fight the print media for years.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.480]   You know, everything was print.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480]   You wanted to get into an event.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.560]   You wanted to get into a PEPCOM event.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.800]   You'd have to give them tear sheets of your articles.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.280]   And I said, I don't do tear sheets.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.880]   Would you like a video?
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.520]   Would you just go to the website?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.840]   No, no, you need to have a tear sheet.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.400]   I've had the worst time with PEPCOM getting into their events.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.080]   Now, it's what's your blog.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.080]   They're smart.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   They got smart.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.080]   No more tear sheets.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.200]   But now what's your blog?
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.560]   What's your URL?
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.440]   All we want to do, Google, is talk about it.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.760]   We just want to cover your gosh darn crap.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.760]   You know what?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.600]   They know we'll cover it anyway.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.600]   What have we learned?
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.480]   Anything yet, Ron, a motto about the on hub that we didn't know?
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:05.280]   There's going to be a developer preview in Q3 this year that switches the operating system
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:10.840]   to Brillo, which is Google's kind of Android based internet of things operating system.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.240]   It is a Trojan horse.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.480]   So yeah, that sounds super awesome.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.040]   Yeah, I was really suspicious of it because you look at the specs and it's got like a
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.560]   dual core processor and like a gig of RAM.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.880]   And I'm like, this is a router really?
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.080]   But yeah, it's going to start running Android soon.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.640]   Brillo, that's their internet of things operating system.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.980]   So, and then I think everybody kind of knew, especially because it's had support for Zig
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:41.800]   B802.15.4, that this was really a home automation play as much as a Wi-Fi play.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.880]   Can anyone explain why Google didn't make this in Amazon Echo?
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.760]   They need speakers and a microphone and they can compete with Amazon.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.480]   We learned last week the speakers are extremely low wattage.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.480]   Yes, it has speakers.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.080]   But it doesn't, it's not the right kind.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   Exactly.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.160]   The Amazon Echo has beautiful speakers, very rich sound.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.920]   And once you buy one, you never need to buy another one because they can upgrade it in
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   the car.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.920]   How much are you guys really using the Echo?
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.480]   I use my Echo 50 times a day.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   Wow.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   It's the most useful device in the house.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   Does your wife make fun of you still?
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.360]   No, she uses it even more heavily than I do.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.800]   We use it for every timer.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.960]   We use it for the weather.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.840]   We use it for the everything.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.240]   It's so useful.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.440]   We have it in the kitchen.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.920]   We don't use it that much.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.280]   I'm thinking I put it in the bathroom.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.040]   That's where a hands-free device would really be handy.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.040]   Yes.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   You keep yours in the kitchen?
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   Kitchen.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.560]   You know, it's great for us because you can say, I won't say her name, but you could say
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.000]   Echo, listen to Tech News today on TuneIn and it'll play.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.240]   It just plays the live stream or it'll play any of the shows.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.520]   You can just say, hey, what's happening?
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.480]   And it'll play BBC news, NPR news, and it'll go into this thing where it has a computer
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.400]   voice reading the news.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.000]   And it's just like totally hands-free.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.720]   I'm so confused about how Amazon beat both Apple and Google to the future of home computing,
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.920]   basically is what this is.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.080]   This is the interface of the future.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.400]   I think it's a small niche, unfortunately.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.400]   I mean, I like it too.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   Let's sing up.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   But I think it's us.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   What do we think?
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.400]   M.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.400]   What do we think about M?
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   M?
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   M?
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.400]   Oh, let's take a break.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   We'll talk about M.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.120]   The new Facebook Messenger tool.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.480]   Is it not Dorothy's hand from--
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.360]   No, in fact, it stands for the Money Penny.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.520]   That was the original code name.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.720]   And no longer stands for Marshmallow because Marshmallow is a marshmallow.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.520]   I wish they'd called it Money Penny, but I think that probably isn't right now.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:34.800]   But that's who it's personal assistant in your messenger.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.080]   And frankly, we have a story about Google Now.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:44.560]   Maybe that Google isn't as committed to Google Now as it used to be, which is really depressing.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.480]   Our show today brought to you by Lynda.com.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.920]   The online learning platform.

[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:37.640]   We've mentioned this before, a new section, a new series with Joseph Lewinashki called
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.240]   the DIY photographer.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   It's so cool.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.520]   Joseph is doing all sorts of crazy stuff.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:48.640]   Handmade macro lenses from common household articles, a light diffuser, a camera stabilizer.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.080]   Really fun.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:56.320]   But there's also high-end stuff like Adobe Camera Raw, Essential Training, Photoshop, Creative
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.920]   Cloud 2015 Essential Training, a great new multi-part series on video photographers.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.640]   That's the new thing, right?
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.640]   You're still a photographer.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.560]   You've got a great digital DSLR and all of a sudden you're shooting video.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.640]   We'll do it better with Lynda.com.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.240]   You can watch and learn.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.320]   Not only from great teachers, but top experts, they're passionate about the field.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.920]   They work in the field.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:27.120]   You can stream thousands of video courses, last count, 3,708 on-demand video courses on
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.120]   your schedule.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.200]   Everybody learns differently.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.120]   Some people want to do a little bit at a time.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.840]   Some people want to go beginning to end.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   You can do whatever you want because it's yours.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.280]   You have the run of the place for one low monthly fee.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.640]   Everything is there.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:47.560]   You can search right into a course and say, "How do I do this?"

[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.800]   just want to learn something new, I want you to go to Lynda.com right now.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.700]   Lynda.com/twig.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.360]   That's our special address because you can sign up there for a free 10-day trial.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.120]   Lyndalynda.com/twig.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:30.000]   10 days to browse around, see whatever you are in the mood to see.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   So it's pretty clear.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.720]   There are two areas that all of these companies, including Google, are all in on.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   One is messaging.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720]   Google's not really all in on a message.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.480]   It should kind of let hang out.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.040]   It's just drift off.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:47.080]   And the other is voice activated, kind of Google Now style stuff.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.520]   And oh, Google's all, no, they're going to let that one go by the wayside too.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.960]   What is Google doing these days?
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.280]   So this is the latest stories that many of the Google Now team disappeared.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.040]   That's Jeff's next book.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   What is Google doing?
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.520]   What the hell is that Google up to?
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.480]   After TF.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:10.360]   After Google I/O and the announcement of Google on tap, according to this story, all but one
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.280]   of Google Now's original team is gone.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.560]   We're gone before I/O some of them.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.000]   And the feeling is that this was something Larry Page really took seriously, but Sundar
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.040]   Pichai less so.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.040]   Well that's disappointing.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.200]   I'm starting to think that I'm just not enough information still.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.560]   I'm starting to think that Sundar Pichai is less of an impressive leader for Google than
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.560]   everybody says.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.240]   Oh, we don't know yet.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.320]   Is he too narrow?
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.960]   He seemed, I mean, this article is a great article in recode and they really talked about
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.480]   his style of leadership.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.280]   He's a, he's kind of like one of these leaders who basically everybody comes to him with
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.960]   a problem and he comes up with a compromise between everybody.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:58.720]   He's kind of a weak leader in that sense where he's more into like handling the politics
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.360]   than being a visionary who says, no, Google Now's the future.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.640]   We're doing it all the way.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.000]   Which is what Page used to do.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Page to do.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Exactly.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.440]   And so I'm worried about that because that's not the kind of company that Google has been
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.440]   traditionally.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.960]   They've been more of a, you know, let's go for it kind of a company, not a Microsoft
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   style.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.320]   Oh, these different people have given me pushback.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.120]   I better make some compromises kind of a company.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.800]   So I don't know.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.120]   That article made me sad.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:29.560]   Mark Bergen writing in recode yesterday says, now escalated inside Google quickly because
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.880]   it had the backing of Page.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.320]   He would open up, he's quoting a anonymous Google source.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.440]   He would open up every single all hands meeting with Google Now.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.800]   Then Page started to step away.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.600]   Blaying the foundation as it turns out now, we know for alphabet.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:55.360]   Meanwhile, Google's core business search continued to lose steam as mobile app usage
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:01.280]   rocketed at some point last year meets in Galley, SVP who had search requested that
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.640]   now be moved from Android into search.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.520]   Several engineers objected according to multiple sources.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:14.680]   Their initial vision of now as a mobile assistant tailored to particular users works best living
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.240]   on mobile, not within search.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.960]   But and this is Pachai making the compromise.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:26.400]   He approves in Galley's request in part, perhaps because Google must balance all products like
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.680]   now which push information to users with its central business problem, how to make more
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.480]   money from mobile.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:39.280]   So in the face of that now, now not that Facebook is the bellwether or the brilliant
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.280]   leader.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.920]   I mean, they've launched a whole lot of products that have just tanked.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.400]   But with Facebook announced or actually was revealed that Facebook is doing a beta test
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.840]   wired head this story today, only with a few hundred people in the Bay Area of something
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.480]   called AM that's part of messenger.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.480]   Yes.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   And it's not just now.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.920]   I mean, it's humans too.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   It's right.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.920]   They make a decision about whether something's going to be handled by a machine or by human
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.920]   beings.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.200]   I think that's one of the brilliant things about this.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.520]   The other is that essentially you're texting this service.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:13.200]   It's not talking and then it's talking back audibly so much as you're it's they're
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.080]   ingraining the habit of using messenger as a texting service.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.520]   And I think that's brilliant as well.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.520]   I really like the direction of this.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:25.520]   I like the fact that this is actually kind of the type of thing that Google would do,
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.160]   which is that other people trying to make a product out of this out of virtual assistants.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.800]   And they're saying, "Ah, it's just a feature.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.400]   It's not a product, it's a feature."
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   And so they're making a feature of messenger giving you a reason to download and use messenger.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.240]   In the context of what we've been talking about in past weeks, Jeff, which is that messenger
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.200]   platforms are the hot new area.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.360]   And pointing back to that New York Times article about WeChat or was it Wired-ing maybe?
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:55.080]   About WeChat the which is basically a platform in China for everything you want to do.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.440]   And companies are using...
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.440]   I'm so tired.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.080]   I'm going to brain...
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   Slack.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.600]   Slack, thank you very much.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.520]   I'm reading his mind now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.520]   That's scary.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.560]   They're using Slack now and all kinds of ways for companies.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.400]   Slack, HipChat, does it.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.720]   WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, is in certain countries huge.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.400]   Line in Japan is as big as WeChat is in China.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:25.720]   Here in the States, everybody, it seems to me, everybody uses X SMS.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   Or if you're on iOS.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.680]   Which is really funny because the rush to the world was so far ahead of us on our nose.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.280]   We just kept you and they caught up and now they've gone way past it.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.680]   Well, because SMS can be expensive, right?
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.720]   Here, it's almost everybody pays for unlimited SMS now.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.760]   So it's essentially free.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.440]   The other paradox here is I think we end up maybe going back to voice.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.760]   It even won one voice communication at some level.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.320]   That's what M might be.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.240]   A lot.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:58.720]   What I love about all this other personal assistant stuff is it's like Google built this new
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:04.960]   API into Marshmallow, the assistant API that makes Google Now on tap work.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:11.160]   So you can build this assistant app and Android has all these hooks in it that it can plug
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.360]   into now.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:17.240]   And then at the same time, they built this API to open the door to everyone else.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:22.080]   You get this article about how they don't care that much about Google Now.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:28.560]   So they kind of shut down their own solution and through the door open for everybody else.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:34.240]   And it's also interesting that I think related to this conversation, which is that Microsoft
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.080]   came out with something that's like Now on tap that doesn't require an API.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   Cortana.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   Yeah, it works really well too.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.000]   Oh, oh, no, it's called on.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   No, it's not.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Yeah, it's not Cortana.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.480]   It's built into Bing Search actually.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.920]   Yeah, it's called snapshot.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.720]   So but you have to use a Windows phone for this?
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   No, it's on Android.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   It's on Android.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   It's on Android.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.720]   It's a lot of other.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   Yeah, Bing Search app.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.920]   I mean, it works the same way as on tap, essentially, if you have an article or something on the
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.120]   screen, you swipe it over.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.520]   Who's going to put Bing Search app on there with Android device, really?
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:08.160]   Well, you know, but Microsoft keeps doing this kind of thing.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.080]   I mean, they did something that's like Project Tango for the iPhone.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:17.080]   It's still in research mode, but looks like Microsoft is really targeting iOS and Android
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.080]   first.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.520]   And eventually, people are going to kind of go, yeah, you know, this Microsoft stuff
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.720]   on Android is actually pretty good.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.120]   It's a differentiator, though, right?
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.120]   It's a differentiator.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.840]   You don't need for starters, you don't need to wait for the developers to build something
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.840]   for it.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.720]   It works right out of the box delivering most of the promises of now on tap.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.720]   So Google got everybody's--
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.320]   Nobody will ever know that if they ever use if they never install it.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   You got to get people to install it.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.720]   It's an uphill battle, your true.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.520]   You're Android phone's going to come with now on tap.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.520]   It comes with now.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.520]   When it does finally latch it.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.400]   I think that's an uphill battle to get people to put a third party search because I know
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.960]   I have hound, which is fast and really interesting.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.120]   And I never use it because I go, OK, Google.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.080]   Well, no, it's so built into the iOS.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   Right.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.480]   Before we leave Facebook, can I do a demo?
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.480]   What do you got?
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.480]   Live.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.480]   I am so mad at you.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.240]   I am so mad at you.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.720]   If you go to my Facebook page, you'll re-arr three, two, one.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.720]   We're going to go.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.480]   Jeff Jarvis got it first.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   We are live.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   So this is the thing that--
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   We were live.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.480]   You think you're so verified.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.760]   We were mocking Ricky's your vase because--
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.080]   So I don't have a cat.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.640]   If you go to my Facebook page--
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   There it is.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   You should see it live.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.640]   There we are.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   They are.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   They are very live.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   Right?
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   There we are.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.640]   How's it been real?
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.640]   Good to see you.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.960]   The first few times I used it today, frankly boring things for my panel, or my conference,
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.320]   it went out of me in like 30 seconds.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.120]   And then I did an eight minute one and it worked fine.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   So here we are.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   Here's my setup.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.800]   Why do you have Post-it notes all over your door?
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   My computer.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.400]   Those say-- my Post-it notes say, can you see them or not?
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.480]   Is this something I was going to have to be start?
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.080]   I'm going to start doing soon.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.800]   One of them says password equals one, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.240]   It says be right back in the men's room getting a sandwich.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.240]   Oh, I get it.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   Oh, that's clever.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   It says, you know, in the other side of the door.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:05.040]   This is my setup for my-- this is the wonderful studio I have here.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.040]   Oh, no.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.040]   It'll catch up.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.520]   It's lagging a little bit.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.400]   No, there's like a 15 second time.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   Yeah, of course.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   I'm not this so bad.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.440]   And now it's Ricky's your vase and Jeff Jarvis.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.440]   I'm so sorry.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.440]   That's been something said.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.320]   It's a nice laptop stand you got there.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.320]   It's a nice way of my--
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.320]   You're not.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.000]   This whole time, I would have thought--
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.360]   I would have thought we got a lot more viewers from--
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   32.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.360]   32.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.880]   Now it's 26 going down.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.880]   What do I do?
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.880]   Take up my clothes?
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.880]   What should I do here?
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.880]   It's going down, Jeff.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.880]   Trying to be more boring.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.880]   It works for Ricky Gervais.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.880]   Yeah, I need a cat.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.200]   I need a-- I need a-- I need a-- I need a-- I need a--
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.600]   I need to imagine there's a cat right here.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.760]   And I'm walking with Ben--
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.960]   So why is somebody--
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   So why is there somebody--
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.960]   Keith Ricky Gervais has.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   Look, I got bangs.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.960]   So when--
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.600]   Ben in the chat room says, we have whole sites dedicated to this
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.800]   apps like Periscope and Miracat.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.680]   Why do we think it'll catch on?
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   Yeah, all of this Facebook stuff when you're like, it's going to
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   show up on Facebook.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.600]   I'm always just like, ah, I don't--
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   Yeah, well, here's the thing.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   My Facebook is all friends and family.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.120]   Ron, yeah, but here's what happens is that Facebook has so much
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.960]   of my attention, my stream attention, right?
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.280]   There were Gervais comes on.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.280]   It gives me the alert right then.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.400]   He says, hey, Ricky's on, and I go to it.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:23.080]   And so whatever Leo gets on in six months, and he's live, then
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.680]   I can see that.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:30.080]   I think there's some uses of Facebook's advantages.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.760]   It has your stream attention.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.160]   Has your attention through a stream versus Periscope?
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.920]   I never end up looking at it in Periscope.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.440]   Never.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.080]   Now, oddly enough, this has to show up in my news feed.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.440]   And Facebook controls that.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.360]   And it may or may not.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   I'm going to look through it.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.280]   It may or may not tell anybody.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.360]   Let me see if yours, which isn't very bad.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.840]   Let me see if you're in my--
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.080]   See, I'm your friend.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.040]   You've followed me.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.200]   You've also followed me, or you just my friend?
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   Is that make a difference?
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.000]   I don't know.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.120]   So is this your page, or is this your personal?
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.880]   No, this is-- I thought that was the problem,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.800]   because my page-- I don't--
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.960]   You have my page in ages.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.400]   Yeah, me neither.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.600]   But it's your profile.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.240]   No, it's my profile.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   There it is.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:11.760]   There it is.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.440]   There it is.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.280]   Way down though.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.240]   You're under Justin Bieber.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:16.800]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   We're just live.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.400]   Like Facebook.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.920]   Like Facebook.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.600]   Priorities here.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.040]   And of course, Google had this three years ago.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.400]   The difference is, as you said, Jeff, that the--
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.480]   once again, the one and only benefit of Facebook
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.080]   is that everybody's on it.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   That's the only feature that I've ever seen.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.960]   So you're saying Hangout's live was the same thing?
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.200]   Three years ago.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.120]   Much better than this, actually, because you
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.880]   could have multiple people.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.120]   If you wanted, you could have one person.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.840]   It was much less of a lag than this,
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.760]   and it posted immediately on YouTube.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.800]   Well, three years ago, and they have 2012.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.240]   But this will stay on Facebook, right?
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.160]   One of the things we're learning about Facebook
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.360]   is that native Facebook video, because it starts playing
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.800]   as soon as you get to it, gets much more engagement
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.960]   than a link to a YouTube, right?
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.120]   Well, no, they just count.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.720]   They count auto plays as--
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.080]   Right.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:02.760]   No, I understand.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.480]   But I think it does get more engagement.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.120]   I think there's no doubt about it.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.600]   Well, when you were scrolling through your list,
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.720]   you passed four videos.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.240]   So that was four views that you--
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.960]   Because you enjoy them?
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.440]   Yeah, I understand, including Ricky Gervais, probably.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.160]   So by the way, I got this working.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.360]   I bought an iPod Touch just for the purpose of testing things
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.440]   like Facebook instant articles in this.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:23.960]   It took me a while.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.920]   For some reason, it wouldn't work.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.960]   But I finally started working.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.160]   My old iPod 4--
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.360]   I mean, iPhone 4.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.440]   Is that how you're streaming this?
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.240]   Is from an iPhone 4?
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.480]   It was an iPod Touch.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.760]   No, an iPod Touch.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.240]   A little tiny iPod Touch.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:34.800]   They have lost it.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.080]   I don't know where it is.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.160]   Shira Lazar gets it, too.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.800]   How come everybody's got it except me?
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.040]   I don't want it anymore.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:43.920]   Lo, take it back, Facebook.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.400]   Go to Facebook.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.400]   Go to Facebook.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.120]   I don't care because I'm really mad.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.960]   I don't really care that much.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.840]   My theory is-- 86 viewers.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.520]   It's a terrible stream because all they're hearing
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.080]   is me and a lot of silence.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:55.880]   Right.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.720]   But my prediction is that when this is open to everybody,
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.880]   then the celebrities will stop using it.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.680]   And then when they stop using it, they'll stop using it.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.560]   Well, that's the question.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.040]   Because I think we talked about this last week.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.000]   What this solves right now is the penis problem.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   I'm speechless.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.120]   Did you have the penis problem?
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.160]   Anything that solves the penis problem, I'm up for.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.360]   Now, what you mean is the problem of people using it
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.280]   to flash the Facebook.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.320]   So by having celebrities, that limits the content
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.160]   that's there right now.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.200]   You'd think, wouldn't you?
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.560]   I think Ricky Chirvay is moments away.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.000]   Yeah, I feel this.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.520]   I don't know why I just feel that.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.000]   He's just moments away from taking off his pants.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.760]   So that happened.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   I can speak to this here for the rest of the show.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.200]   One of the things I really like about the Note 5
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:57.480]   and the new S6 Plus is this YouTube live streaming that's
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.280]   built on the camera.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.040]   Yeah, that's so cool.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.120]   And I've used it a few times.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.880]   And it's actually-- it is pretty neat.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.280]   To me, that it makes more sense, maybe?
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:06.960]   Or maybe not.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.280]   A YouTube live built into-- is it just a YouTube app?
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.240]   No, it's in the camera app.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.280]   So if you're in the camera app, one of the modes--
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:14.760]   In the same sound.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.840]   You have a panorama mode and a pro mode.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.200]   One of the modes is live broadcast mode.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.640]   You tap that button.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.440]   And I've tied it into my YouTube account.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.960]   You obviously have to do that.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.480]   Preparing broadcast, Leola Port's live broadcast,
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.440]   I'm now live in public on YouTube with this broadcast
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.680]   right there.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.840]   So you take your Facebook live feed.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.800]   There we go.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.240]   And I'm going to rebroadcast it on a YouTube right now.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.360]   Is that fair use?
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.520]   Or--
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.520]   It doesn't seem fair.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.680]   We're crossing the streams now.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.000]   And then I can do this.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.160]   I think this is kind of cool.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.120]   I feel like, for instance, we're having a meetup.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.960]   Hey, Jeff, can you come to our meetup, by the way,
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.720]   on September?
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.160]   I'm going to be in Europe.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.000]   I'm totally mirror-cating this right now.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.600]   Oh.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.080]   So would you--
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.400]   It is the battle of the platforms, I guess.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.280]   See, the Samsung thing, though, that should be an app.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.520]   And I'm sure YouTube will release an app--
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.360]   Absolutely.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.400]   --a few weeks or months or whatever.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.520]   It's not reason to buy a phone, which is weird.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.760]   Although, apparently, they have a deal with YouTube.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.160]   I mean, it's not just like they just built it in.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.520]   There's some sort of deal going.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.280]   Yeah, yeah, I'm sure YouTube was involved.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.080]   But I don't think they have an exclusive on the feature
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:27.600]   or anything.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.560]   I'm sure it'll roll out to everybody else.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.520]   This is the first time I've had a reason to use Meerkat
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.440]   in like four months.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.600]   Yeah, it's just a bunch of narcissists, frankly.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:39.280]   All right.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.080]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.120]   You call a narcissist.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.420]   I was listening to you, Wayne, when you talked about me.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:49.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.040]   What a terrible world we live in.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.880]   And now, Donald, I'm just going to be president.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.240]   And that's just-- I don't know what--
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:54.900]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.840]   Hey, Rainbow says anything to say about it.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.880]   You had to sit down, Jeff.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.680]   You had to sit down.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:58.880]   I'm calling you.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.080]   You had some things to say about that in your blog, buzzing
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.720]   machine.com.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.200]   I'm sort of stuck to a question.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.280]   You believe that the mainstream media
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.160]   has become a lap dog to the Donald.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.960]   I used a different term.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.360]   Yeah, but I'm going to use a lap dog.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.920]   I've used a stronger term.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.960]   Yes, I did.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.840]   I thought I'd get some crap for that using that term.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.360]   I did a footnote that said it was stronger than a laptop.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.120]   So go look it up on Buzz machine if you're curious
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:23.960]   what we're talking about.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.360]   Yeah, I think it's ridiculous.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:30.520]   After Trump's thing in Iowa, CNN was just falling over
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.020]   themselves.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.040]   Oh, that was really great.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.360]   What a show.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.920]   And treated like show business.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.280]   And Jorge Ramos, who is an extremely important figure.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.240]   He is the most important figure in Spanish language media.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.400]   He's the Walter Cronkite of American Spanish language
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:44.760]   television.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.280]   Bingo.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.680]   And it's highly unlikely that Donald Trump did not
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.560]   know who he was.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.400]   Oh, you bet he knows.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:49.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.080]   Don't forget Donald Trump was supposedly suing
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.280]   Univision for $50 million and for $500 million.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.440]   I don't know what it is.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.880]   For dropping them out for his comments about Mexicans
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.280]   and so he knew exactly what he told him.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   You know, get back to Univision, which is the same as saying.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.400]   Get back to Mexico.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.680]   He basically deported him out of the press conference.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.080]   And then claimed he didn't know who security was.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   Of course, it's his security.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:12.760]   Just some cracks.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.680]   He nodded to the security saying, and then they brought him back
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.200]   in and then he just acted like a good guy.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.040]   But you ask a very interesting question, which
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.320]   is if Jake Tapper had been shoved out of the room
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.640]   for being impertinent to Donald Trump, what would have happened?
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.520]   And I think that would have been a different situation, right?
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.840]   They all sort of left the room.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.120]   They should have asked the same questions
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.040]   that Raymos was trying to ask.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.000]   Instead, what happened?
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.200]   The next question, somebody if I gets in,
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.800]   Megan Kelly and his feud.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.080]   We've all become part of Trump's reality show.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:42.560]   You know why?
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.060]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:43.060]   It's good.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:43.960]   We're all schmucks.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.840]   Good ratings.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.640]   Yeah, well, that's what that's depressing as hell.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.520]   That's not the only business we're in in journalism.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.440]   As long as we're talking about journalism,
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:56.680]   just a deep condolences to the friends and family
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:02.440]   and everybody, coworkers, coworkers, just a tragic story.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.720]   Awful, awful, awful day.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.960]   You know, let's be clear that the journalists die
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.720]   all the time in the rest of the world.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.640]   They don't usually die during stand-ups.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.920]   They don't die doing a simple, feature-y stand-up, right?
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.400]   With a sanctity for the Chamber of Commerce.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.160]   Yeah, it's just awful.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.480]   And I heard I heard gotten some tips on Facebook already
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.920]   because having discussions on Twitter,
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.760]   because to my mind, do not name this person.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.480]   I mean, once they name him once, it's fine.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.520]   Do not give me the attention.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.560]   Do not air his stupid manifesto, especially.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.240]   Do not air the video he took for God's sake
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.640]   saw something like Facebook Live on Periscope or on YouTube
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.440]   or whatever tool he used to tape the actual crime.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.640]   Twitter pulled it down immediately, right?
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.200]   And to do that, I got a big fight with somebody on Twitter.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:55.440]   You know, I said, you're part of the crime
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.800]   of the next person who does it.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.720]   And you're only giving that person what they want.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.880]   And it's only for sensationalism.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.720]   You do it.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.040]   It doesn't really inform us anymore.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.800]   And there's a limit and there are levels of responsibility.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.880]   And yeah, I was fairly disgusted with what was happening
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.000]   immediately.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.720]   There's nothing served by serving this maniacs, this murder.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   We won't mention his name.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.360]   He was a disgruntled employee, I can't think of it.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.680]   Yeah, two names anyway.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.240]   There is one thing that needs to be said that's somewhat
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.840]   positive, which is that Twitter and Facebook both reacted
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.320]   very quickly and very appropriately.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.520]   In Twitter's case, they kept his profile up
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.440]   and removed all the content from that profile.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:39.560]   So they didn't just have this question-raising error message.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.480]   They basically just had his profile there,
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:42.520]   but there's no content.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:46.160]   So there was no way to sensationalize what he had said
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.280]   or done.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.080]   But at the same time, you got confirmation
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.880]   that in fact this was the Twitter account that was in the news.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.040]   So that was the right thing to do.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.240]   So deepest condolences to friends and family of Allison
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.400]   Park, Arnad, Amourd.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:05.720]   And the good news is that the Chamber of Commerce
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.000]   executive director who was also shot
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.480]   is expected to recover, but Vicki Gardner.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.040]   But it's just very sad.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.600]   And it's also for--
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.360]   I mean, this was not just somebody going after somebody
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:19.840]   randomly.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.400]   It was not just for the-- because they were public.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.720]   It was a disgruntled employee.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.160]   But can we do a simplest thing in public?
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.480]   And that now potentially draws a magnet of nuts to you.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.200]   And that's scary for all of us.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:36.120]   Well, I don't do stand-ups, so I'm not going to do anything.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.680]   Go ahead.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:38.920]   Depress him.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.400]   All right, let's find something else to talk about.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.840]   It's much nicer than it has to do with tech.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.920]   And we like--
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.160]   God, it's hard to say.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.320]   How about Verizon?
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.960]   What is hum?
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.640]   You covered this this morning on TNT.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.600]   Tell me about hum.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.080]   Hum is kind of a cool thing, actually.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.400]   Basically, what it is is it gives you
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:03.040]   on-star-like functionality for your old car.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.960]   Just about any car made in the last 20 years
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.280]   will work with this.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.640]   And it gives you many of the features of on-star,
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:14.400]   which is a very expensive, concierge-like, emergency-oriented
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.240]   GPS-specific service, but at a fraction of the price.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.160]   And--
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:24.280]   It's interesting, the OBD 2 port, which every car has.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.960]   We've talked a little bit about that.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.760]   I use it to give me grades as I'm driving.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.160]   But you could put this connector in that port.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.760]   What's your GPA at this point?
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.600]   I'm good.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.600]   I'm doing good.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.520]   99.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:41.080]   Because it gives you penalties for stepping on the gas.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.000]   Fast acceleration.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.360]   In fact, my watch will beep now for this fast acceleration.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:49.240]   And it'll also jamming on the brakes as bad.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.760]   But what's actually most useful is it tells me
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.400]   how much the gas that I spent--
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.880]   --that I use on that trip.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.680]   Like that trip costs you 99 cents.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.680]   When you don't know that, it's very easy to drive around a lot.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.560]   But since you start seeing--
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.240]   Well, what?
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.760]   That cost me a buck.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.240]   I've been driving a Prius since 2004, I think.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.520]   And I've always contended that the main way
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.560]   that you save gas to the Prius is that it shows you
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.840]   how much gas you're burning.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.560]   Just the knowledge.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.320]   You're rare.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.400]   It causes you to ease up on the accelerator.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.480]   So this will send you--
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.400]   So that thing connects to something on your visor.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.920]   So there's something that clips to your visor.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.400]   And again, it's got GPS.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.560]   And it does all kinds of really cool stuff.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.840]   It collects data on things like your fuel economy--
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.720]   It's right back to the horizon.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.040]   --all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:30.680]   But it also has--
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.800]   It has Verizon doing this.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.120]   Yeah, it has Verizon.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.760]   Well, it's another data thing.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.280]   So it's like you're renting it from them.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.440]   It has an SIM card.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.320]   It's basically like--
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.240]   $15 a month.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.640]   It's an Internet of Things devices.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.560]   Let's be clear about it.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.320]   It's a marriage of the Internet of Things with mobile data.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.080]   Yeah, and it uses a mobile data system.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.000]   But it costs $15 a month.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.600]   No upfront.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.000]   Well, Drew calls.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.960]   No, it won't do calls.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.880]   It's not a phone.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.160]   But it will track--
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.760]   Like, it does things-- there's an app, right?
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.920]   That goes on your phone.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.040]   And it will do things like--
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.240]   it'll remind you where your car is.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.680]   And there's also a place for you to take pictures and add
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.920]   notes about, oh, I'm on level three
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.840]   in this part of the parking garage.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.920]   If you have your car stolen, you can report it stolen.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.540]   It says, OK, make sure you fill out a police
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.040]   report.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.280]   Here's what you give to the police.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.560]   And then here's where it is.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.760]   Mostly about road safety, though.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.720]   Isn't that why you want it?
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.520]   It's mostly one on-star.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.360]   I had an accident come get me, or I might broke down,
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.840]   come get me.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.240]   Yes.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.720]   But a normal company would build this and just
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.120]   have a Bluetooth to your phone.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.840]   And then you wouldn't have another monthly cellular bill.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.160]   Yes.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.440]   There's really no reason for it to have a cell phone connection
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.600]   when you're bringing that cell phone.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.440]   Oh, you're right.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.400]   You're already paying for that connection.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.280]   And of course, Verizon says--
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.280]   Yes.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.320]   The difference is that when you get out of your car,
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.620]   you take your phone with you.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:47.020]   And this thing keeps GPS with a data connection in the car.
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.180]   So if your car is stolen, or if you park your car,
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:53.460]   then each of you has a GPS, and you can find each other.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.700]   So that's one difference.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.100]   You want to throw this out the window
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.620]   if you steal somebody's car, just a little tip.
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.900]   Yeah, if you're going to steal cars, that's what you do.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.900]   Verizon says it will vigorously protect your data,
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.500]   sharing it with third parties, only in cases
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.060]   where it's needed to provide services.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.780]   But they politely ask Verizon.
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.660]   They politely ask.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:12.580]   And it will share data with law enforcement only
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.660]   where authorized and required by law.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:15.500]   Oh, no.
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.420]   I don't really trust Verizon.
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.780]   That's pretty much everywhere.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:18.820]   I don't really trust Verizon.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.820]   I don't trouble AT&T, which would not be a bunch of--
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.220]   Yeah, I don't trust any of them.
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:23.220]   Shmucks.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.380]   So Verizon--
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:25.940]   You see the other news on Verizon right below there
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:26.940]   on the rundown?
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.460]   Tell us all about it, Mr. Jeff Jarvis Verizon fan.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.780]   You might remember my fight.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.940]   Niagara Falls.
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:34.940]   Yes.
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.900]   That's a good idea.
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.640]   To try to get my Nexus 7 attached to the Verizon network
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.740]   as was required by law.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.940]   And I completed the FCC.
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:44.860]   And of course, I lost.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:45.780]   And good guys lost.
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.380]   And nothing ever happened because the FCC didn't
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.220]   really connect us to this.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.860]   Another matter of Verizon's a bunch of shmucks.
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:53.140]   Well, now I'm guessing because they're charging you full price
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.340]   for phones, then there's no special deal
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.820]   to be hung with Verizon.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.980]   Now, suddenly Verizon will let you connect your unlocked phones
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.700]   to the Verizon network.
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:05.060]   Glory-oskey.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:05.980]   Took them a little-- what?
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:07.380]   About a year and a half here?
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.380]   Now, Mike.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.720]   They will finally take your money.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.160]   Yes.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:12.600]   Yes.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.100]   Yes.
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:13.600]   Exactly.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:13.600]   Exactly.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:18.160]   The issue hasn't had always been that their CDMA.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.080]   You could only do this.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.080]   It's only works now.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.040]   No, that's when they want--
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.400]   when they want part of the spectrum.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.960]   Remember the story.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.360]   Google was part of that spectrum of auction.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.960]   And Google threw in the requirement for openness
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.800]   that you could have open connectivity.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.240]   Google then-- and they basically did it
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.720]   for that reason to get that in there.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.160]   Then Google dropped out of the race.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.480]   Verizon won that spectrum.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.620]   But attached to it was a requirement
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.260]   of open connectivity that Verizon never honored
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:49.260]   for GSM for spectrum.
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:53.420]   So if you have an LTE capable phone,
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.940]   LTE requires a SIM card.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.820]   And most of the new Verizon phones I get
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.580]   have a SIM card for LTE.
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:55:59.080]   Right.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.300]   You could put anybody's SIM card in there.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.900]   They're unlocked because they've had to because of a consent
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.140]   degree with the FCC.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:09.500]   This is only for CDMA devices that you want to bring to Verizon's
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:10.260]   network.
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:10.900]   Oh, it is.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:11.860]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.900]   Oh, I missed that.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:20.580]   Well, they have a site you can go to.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:24.860]   But plenty of devices have CDMA as well as GSM and LTE
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:25.740]   and all that stuff there.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.860]   Especially since CDMA is a big deal in China too.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.700]   Well, if you've got a phone at Sprint, for instance--
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.540]   I mean, there's really--
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:33.180]   this is really--
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.340]   your Sprint phone can work on Verizon basically.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.340]   Oh, so I read a different version of the line.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.500]   I might be misunderstanding.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.260]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.380]   I read an earlier version I couldn't find, which just basically
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:44.580]   said, oh, you hook up your Nexus 7 now.
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:45.580]   Oh.
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.980]   Well, let's put it this way.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:47.380]   I have it--
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.380]   Maybe you still can't.
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.420]   I have a Verizon iPhone.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.580]   If I pop the SIM out of that, I could put anybody else's SIM
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.180]   card in there.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:58.460]   And it works fine on AT&T, on T-Mobile,
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.940]   because that's an unlocked SIM slot.
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:05.540]   And I think all of Verizon's LTE SIM slots are by law unlocked.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:08.260]   So that's not a problem bringing--
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.100]   I would guess it could go the other way if I had an AT&T--
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.500]   actually, that's an interesting question.
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.340]   But the activation is not done for--
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.620]   CDMA is not done by the simple introduction of a SIM card.
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:25.780]   They have to unlock your phone by sending a signal down the line.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.620]   So what you'll do is you enter your device ID
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.740]   to see if your device is compatible,
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:35.740]   and then they'll activate it for you.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:38.580]   And take your money.
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.900]   It's kind of gookie.
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:45.100]   So let's see, Nexus, there's an Android operating system.
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.820]   From your home screen select menu settings about phone status,
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:52.220]   you need your IMEI, ESN, or MEID number.
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.020]   Have you tried this yet, Jeff?
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:55.500]   No, I'm not giving them a penny.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.260]   It's so funny that this is being trumpeted, because it is.
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:03.740]   It's just saying, oh, yeah, we'll take your money.
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:04.740]   Big deal.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.500]   Thank you for having me.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:10.220]   All I tried to do, I tried and tried and tried to give the shmuck's money,
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.500]   and they wouldn't take it.
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:13.380]   I just sat--
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:16.220]   The reason I tried so hard was I already had a shared data thing.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.780]   Right.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.660]   Too late.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:26.660]   That reminds me I'm still paying for my old Chromebook Pixel SIM.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:27.500]   Oh, wow.
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:28.500]   How'd I cancel that?
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.140]   Now you know why Google didn't do a SIM in the next year.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.740]   Mine is still active.
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:39.220]   From Google I/O, I still have LTE.
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:39.660]   What did I do for free?
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:41.260]   I still have free LTE.
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.420]   Don't tell anyone.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:43.940]   [COUGHING]
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.260]   I don't know.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:48.660]   I'm as amazed as everyone here is.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:51.940]   So we'll talk a little bit about the new interactive Android Wear
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.100]   watches.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:53.940]   I got one.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.940]   I can do it.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:59:03.460]   We'll talk about I-A-I-M-A-I, which is the most obscure
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.420]   palindrome you'll ever hear.
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:09.580]   We'll talk about the stock market up and down,
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:13.860]   and a new feature in Google Photos all coming up in just a little bit.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:17.900]   But first a word for those of you on page your duty.
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:21.900]   And those of you who make other people do page your duty.
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:25.140]   I'm talking about page your duty in operations, performance.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.340]   I love page your duty.
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:28.060]   Have you seen the T-shirt?
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:31.140]   Don't hate the page or hate the game.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:34.060]   PageYourDuty.com, it's a great site.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:36.260]   If you're on call, you know what they're talking about.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.020]   You want that T-shirt?
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.100]   I'll tell you how you can get it for free in just a second.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:42.220]   Page Your Duty is they'd prefer to think themselves
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:44.780]   as an operations performance platform.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:47.860]   It delivers to you and your boss and everybody
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:52.540]   in the operation information that not only will, of course,
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:56.540]   help the people on call get the right information
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.620]   so they can fix the problem, but also optimize your system
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.220]   so you don't have as many incidents.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.700]   If you rely on your software and services to always be up,
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.940]   you gots to have page your duty.
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.580]   It becomes the hub of your operations,
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:12.220]   connecting all your systems into an easy-to-use,
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.540]   easy-to-see, single-view.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.420]   You'll see all the critical events.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.060]   And we're talking more than 100 ready-to-use integrations.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.780]   Nagios, new relic, that's what we use.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.940]   Keynote, App Dynamics, they have a great API,
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:26.860]   so it makes it very simple for you to roll your own.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.580]   You'll decrease your resolution time
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.420]   because when an incident occurs, page your duty,
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.940]   it already knows who's on call.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.060]   It has the on call schedules.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.500]   It even has personalized alerting preferences,
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.220]   so it will notify the right team
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:43.940]   and the right team member first time, right time, every time.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.740]   And if the alert isn't responded to,
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.700]   it automatically escalates to another team member
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.220]   until it is responded to.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.060]   It's very smart.
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:56.060]   De-doops, the alerts so that they're automatically filtered
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.660]   and de-duplicated, so only actionable alerts are delivered
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.860]   and they're not over-delivered.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.420]   You can dispatch alerts, not just by pagers.
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.540]   You could tell they've been around a while,
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.580]   but really now it's phone calls, SMS, email,
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.340]   push notifications.
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.260]   You can resolve incidents on the go.
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.140]   It's really, the people on page your duty will love this.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.220]   And the analytic tools, this is what the boss will love.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.980]   The analytic tools built into page your duty
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.620]   will help you identify common problems
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.380]   so you can make system improvements
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.020]   and prevent future outages.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.540]   Isn't that what we're all about?
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.540]   Page your duty is relentless when it comes to reliability
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:32.980]   fully distributed across multiple data centers,
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.700]   multiple hosting providers,
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.620]   multiple contact method providers per method.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.980]   You're not gonna miss an alert.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.660]   And I can't tell you how frustrating it is
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.700]   when something goes wrong or the server goes down
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.460]   and nobody responds to it
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.900]   or nobody even knows it happened.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.260]   This solves that problem.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.100]   Customize it to fit how you and your teamwork
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.980]   regardless of location or size.
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.420]   This page of duty is the one.
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.060]   I mean, Microsoft uses it.
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.100]   Boeing uses it.
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.620]   GitHub uses it.
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.180]   Get the right engineer on the right problem
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.020]   at the right time.
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.100]   Pageyourduty.com/twit.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.540]   You can get a two-week trial
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.100]   and for as little as 19 bucks a month
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.980]   increase your uptime.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.900]   And you'll be showing your support for Twit.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.380]   Pageyourduty.com.
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.980]   P-A-G-E-R-D-U-T-Y.com/twit.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.820]   And by the way, when you sign up for your new account
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.020]   you get the T-shirt.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:24.500]   I have one, I should wear it.
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:28.220]   Pageyourduty.com/twit.
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.860]   If your sass is on the line,
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.900]   you need Pageyourduty.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:33.860]   I love that too.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.100]   Google Photos has introduced a new feature.
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.660]   Recover the day.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.940]   It's kind of anything but use time hop.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.940]   It's like time hop.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:41.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.620]   - I like time hop.
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.460]   - Yeah.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.540]   - That sounds a little weird because it just picks
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:50.380]   the day in history and then just picks a bunch of,
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.700]   let me see if I have one now.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.700]   I don't, I have had a few.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.540]   I don't have one right now.
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.100]   - I call this featureization and Google does it a lot.
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.980]   Basically another company like Time Hop,
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.620]   another app exists as a product
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.660]   and Google says no, it's just a feature.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.780]   - Right.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.180]   - And therefore we're not validating your category.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:10.140]   - Here is August 20th, 2013.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.540]   Two years ago, this was Henry,
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:16.620]   was about to go to college for the first time
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.500]   and he was saying goodbye to us and his friends
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.220]   and he had a big dinner around the round table
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.460]   at Seared, the local steakhouse.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:27.100]   And so these are all the pictures I took in videos to,
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.460]   not particularly well organized or anything,
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.660]   just kind of montaged altogether.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.580]   Hey, that was your day two years ago.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.820]   Thank you very much, Google.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.780]   Time hop does it better, I think.
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.900]   If you want this.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.260]   - Yeah, so check this out.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.460]   I don't have mine on the,
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.260]   I don't know if we have the overhead on this, but.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.980]   - I can give you the special doohickey.
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:47.020]   You want the special doohickey?
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:47.860]   - Sure.
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:48.700]   - Here's the special doohickey,
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.060]   plug that into your machine.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.580]   - I feel like a special doohickey.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.940]   - I can tell the other side.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.020]   Let me see, okay, so I'm--
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.460]   - Other side.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.300]   Other side of it.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.300]   - Yeah.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.300]   - Oh, it's HDMI, nice.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.140]   - Do you have a doohickey too, Ron?
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.220]   Everybody should have one.
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:04.260]   I stuck my doohickey in the wrong way
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.700]   and now it won't come out.
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.020]   - Yeah.
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.980]   - I can't, so I tried this while we were in a break
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.660]   and it doesn't fix anything.
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:11.500]   It goes in.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.500]   - All right.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.340]   - I don't wanna push it.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:15.780]   - If you press it in more, you'll get the clicky.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:16.740]   - That I don't want, right?
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.220]   'Cause that could break it off.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.580]   - No, I try it.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.340]   I mean-- - It's almost all the way in.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:24.340]   This is the part where I just let gravity do it.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.540]   Should I push it past that point?
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.380]   - Sure, yeah, there's--
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.580]   - That's fixed it. - It should clicky thing.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:29.420]   And then--
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.260]   - Did that fix it?
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.420]   - Yeah, it should, yeah, mine like kind of started vibrating
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.460]   then and it should like, you know,
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.100]   vibrate like you're removing the pen.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.580]   (laughs)
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.500]   - It clicks.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.180]   - Oh.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.980]   - Does it start vibrating when you move it in and out?
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.700]   - It was still doing that when it was stuck, but now, now--
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:52.900]   - Right, okay, yeah, so I guess I busted off your thing.
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.980]   - I busted my duhickey.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.100]   Okay, we are now looking at--
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:58.940]   - Can you see the state?
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:04:59.780]   - Yeah, there we go.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.860]   So two years ago, I was in living in Florence
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:06.860]   and this bar was doing a Christmas in August celebration.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:08.060]   - See, it's just a bunch of pictures.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.580]   I don't-- - Yeah.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.380]   - I guess that's okay.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.740]   - So here I am with the Virgin Mary.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.220]   - Nice.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.700]   Didn't look like a Virgin to me.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.060]   - Yeah, you know, well, you know,
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:20.580]   it's, I'm not gonna say anything, but--
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.660]   - It's okay, and it's okay.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.220]   - But anyway, yeah, it's, you're right.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.700]   It's not as good as Time Hop.
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.140]   They're not being selective here.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.100]   They're just kind of saying,
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.540]   here's a giant pile of pictures from the past.
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:32.460]   - There are so many nice features in the Assistant,
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.820]   but some of the images I don't really want.
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:36.740]   - Yeah.
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.700]   - There's Santa, so you had Santa and the Virgin Mary.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.300]   - Yes, it was very ecumenical.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:45.300]   - I wouldn't say had, but yeah, it was, you know,
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.580]   good bar too, right there.
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.220]   - I do like the stories.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.620]   Do you like stories? Do you use stories?
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:53.620]   - Yeah, they're best when you go in
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.540]   and find that one picture that just totally doesn't fit
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.820]   and swap it out for a good one.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.660]   - Yes, they're so cute.
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.500]   - You have to tweak it.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.340]   - You have to tweak it.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.420]   - It's never perfect the way they do it.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.100]   But it's a nice feature, it's really well done.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.820]   They give you the maps and the dotted line
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:06.820]   that goes across the thing.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.260]   And now you went to Sausoleto.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.100]   - I do like that.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.020]   - Yeah, it's, it's, it's, since I'm never gonna,
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.500]   I put all my photos in Google Photos
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.820]   'cause I'm never gonna do what I ought to do,
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:16.300]   which is, you know, make an album or.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.900]   - The thing is, since this isn't part
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.180]   of a social network anymore,
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.740]   when are you supposed to stumble across it?
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:22.580]   - Right, yeah.
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.980]   - You have to open the Google Photos app
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.180]   and find it in there.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.500]   - Right.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.420]   - Yes.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:28.940]   Don't you ever do that?
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.260]   - No, maybe if I need to do something,
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.740]   if I'm looking for a picture,
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.980]   but I never open it to like browse through--
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.500]   - Oh, it's not like Plus is dead.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.660]   Plus is still there.
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:39.540]   - It's still there.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.100]   In fact, here's a tip for you folks.
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.020]   When Google Photos first came out,
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.940]   I was very positive on it
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.820]   and I've since become more negative on it.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.940]   The editing tools are clearly superior in Google Plus
[01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.740]   and they're still there.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:56.260]   So if you, if you, if you go into Google,
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:57.980]   if you do a Google Plus post,
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.980]   go into pick a picture
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.620]   and then you'll have all the editing tools in there.
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.140]   They have things like, you know,
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.940]   they have better focusing,
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.740]   you can focus on one part of the picture
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.460]   and blur the rest and control that.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.060]   So the tools are, it's everything
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:13.900]   that the Google Photo editing tools are
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:17.100]   plus more refined other options as well.
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.380]   So yeah, but it's still there.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.740]   - So there's the Google Plus editing tools,
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:24.300]   the Google Photos editing tools and then Snapseed.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.820]   - This is Google's problem.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.660]   - They're all separate.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.420]   - Yes, they do this so often.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.180]   It's they create so much confusion
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.740]   about what the product is and where it is.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.140]   - What they should do is just roll out Snapseed everywhere.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:35.980]   - Yes.
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:37.260]   - Because I think that's still better than,
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.700]   than Google Plus and free.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.660]   So they really have no reason to withhold it
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.140]   or lock it into an app.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.140]   - That's exactly right.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.980]   That is the best tip, you Snapseed.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.940]   - How about this YouTube gaming?
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.140]   Has anybody got the app yet?
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:50.500]   I haven't gotten it on Android,
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.980]   but supposedly today's the day.
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:55.580]   - Oh yeah, I've had early access.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.020]   - Oh, you've been writing about it, yeah.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.140]   - Yeah, and they had,
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.500]   they had a hands on thing a couple months ago.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.180]   It's really neat.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:06.620]   I mean, it kind of covers all of the stuff
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:08.460]   that Twitch covers, but it's YouTube
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.940]   and there's way more eyeballs there
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.180]   and YouTube streaming is way better.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:18.100]   And it, you know, everything works over HTML5.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.780]   There's DVR capabilities so you can rewind a live stream.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:25.540]   Which I would love to do on Twitch the other day,
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.580]   or on a, on Twitch the other day when I,
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.140]   when I heard about you, you know.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.940]   - Oh, we used to have that rewind.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.460]   - And like I want to go backwards and see,
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.140]   see what happened because I missed the first part.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.980]   - And we used to have that rewind capability
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:39.020]   but the new site took it away.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:42.020]   - It's cool, but like, kind of like Facebook,
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.860]   Twitch is where people are right now.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:48.380]   And you know, the people that watch these video game streams
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.300]   have their favorite streamers,
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.860]   and unless they want to switch platforms,
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:56.660]   it's going to be tough for YouTube gaming to take off.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.460]   So I guess what they need to do is like,
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.660]   pay attention to those people and try to make the streamers happy
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.740]   so that they'll switch over.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.180]   - Gaming.YouTube.com and then there are apps
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.460]   for Android and iOS.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.740]   What, the apps just let you watch video.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.060]   I presume not record it.
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:16.660]   - I don't think they do.
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.780]   I think that's a future feature that they're going to have.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.540]   They talked about one day streaming, you know,
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.060]   candy crush from your phone and.
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.540]   - I think that'd be kind of fun.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:29.740]   - Watch me play Fallout Shelter.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:33.820]   - The cool thing about this though is that it's not just
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.780]   live streaming, it's all of Google's video,
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:39.660]   or all of YouTube's video content plus live streaming.
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:43.900]   So they made 25,000 game pages.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:46.500]   And they kind of sent their robots to work on YouTube
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:50.220]   to categorize all of the videos on their by game
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.540]   and by type of content.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:52.540]   - Wow.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.500]   - So, you know, you just go click on like Minecraft
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.860]   and you'll get all the Minecraft live streams
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.540]   and all the Minecraft YouTube videos
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:01.700]   all on this one page.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.100]   - I may be wrong, but I think Minecraft is much better
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.660]   represented as it is on YouTube than it is on Twitch.
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:11.380]   Twitch tends to be League of Legends, more hardcore gaming.
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.820]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.780]   And you can start games, which is neat.
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:20.260]   So it'll kind of, it helps with discoverability, I guess,
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.300]   when you say, you know, I like Hearthstone,
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:25.020]   it'll show you not only, you know, your favorite streamers,
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.700]   but whoever else is playing in popular videos
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.540]   in that category and all sorts of stuff.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:33.140]   - So, Ron, I talked to Jeffrey Grub
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:34.740]   on techniques today this morning,
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:37.380]   and I asked him what would stop somebody
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:39.500]   from using as just a live streaming, you know,
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:43.740]   Mircat clone and having nothing to do with games.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.260]   And he wasn't sure about the answer.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.780]   Do you have any idea if they will ban you
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.220]   if you just try to do streams
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.780]   that are not related to gaming content?
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:56.900]   - No, I mean, YouTube's live stream thing existed before this.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.780]   So you've been able to do YouTube live streams before,
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.140]   but they were set up as like events,
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.580]   like you would have to schedule it
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.180]   and have a calendar entry.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:09.380]   It was set up like for rock concerts, basically.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:11.540]   And with the YouTube gaming thing,
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:15.380]   the streaming part of it is not actually part
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.980]   of YouTube gaming.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.180]   So is this live?
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:21.060]   Is this a live video we're watching?
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.660]   - Yeah, well, this is an ad.
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.980]   - After an ad, it will be.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:24.860]   - No, no, I mean, okay.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.900]   So if you go click on the top, right,
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.700]   and pick like live stream or something,
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.420]   is there an option up there to live stream?
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.900]   - Says go live.
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.980]   - So you can go live. - Yeah, like that.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:34.820]   See what happens.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.900]   - How do I embed myself in this?
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.340]   It's not using Flash either.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.780]   So this must be-- - See now,
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.540]   you have left YouTube gaming
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:43.580]   and you're just on regular YouTube.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.500]   - And it says for any reason, by the way,
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.340]   it doesn't have to be gaming.
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:50.780]   So they're gonna categorize it at some later date.
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.780]   Maybe they have an algorithm.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.780]   - There's a special interface for games,
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:57.940]   but as part of it, they totally revamped live streaming,
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.780]   basically. - Nice.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.700]   - And anybody can use it, yeah, for whatever.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.060]   It's just a matter of where do these end up
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.060]   when they're not gaming live streams?
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.060]   - I've been really-- - I'm not really sure,
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:10.860]   'cause nobody does non-gaming live streams on YouTube.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.020]   - You get a live URL that you can point people to,
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:14.860]   but I don't know where it says.
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:18.100]   - It's presumably archived on your Eurocap, right?
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.740]   - Yeah, it would end up on your,
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:21.620]   it would probably end up on your channel page.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.540]   - Right. - And now--
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.620]   - So if I'm a let's play gamer,
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.740]   it doesn't go to my channel page, it goes somewhere else?
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.660]   - No, no, it goes to your channel page
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:33.020]   and it goes to YouTube gaming as a,
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.380]   under that game category. - Under categorized, I get it.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.740]   - And it goes in that game under the let's play category,
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.780]   which it automatically detects and pulls out.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.860]   - This is almost really a specialized search.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.580]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:48.380]   - Yeah, it's all kind of like-- - That's mobile,
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.300]   that's Clash of Clans, so that nearly they have mobile play.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.500]   Or is this an ad?
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.340]   - No, this is Clash of Clans, yeah.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:55.260]   - Oh, okay.
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.140]   - Huh, weird.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:01.420]   - I would really like to have figure out how to do this.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:05.460]   I wanna just, I wanna be the bad gamer,
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.740]   like the old man gamer.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.780]   - I know what happens when you,
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:10.740]   oh my God, it blew up!
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:11.660]   - I wanna be that guy.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:12.580]   - See, I think that would be,
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.620]   I think that would be very entertaining.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.020]   - Stop killing me.
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:17.980]   (laughs)
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:18.820]   - So what do I need?
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:22.140]   I need a camera, but you'd think I would know
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:23.660]   how to do this, I'll have to ask my team.
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.180]   - You have to do it.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.740]   - You probably have it in your laptop, right?
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:27.580]   - Probably could do it.
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:30.780]   Well, I had heard somewhere that there would be software
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:34.300]   that would automatically cut you out
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.740]   and put you in the game and stuff like that.
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.700]   - Yeah, some people do blue screen or green screen backgrounds,
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.860]   which looks really neat where it's all--
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.340]   - But I thought that this was something YouTube
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:43.940]   was gonna add to the game.
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.900]   - Well, Leo, you're a streamer.
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.940]   Are you gonna put Twitch on YouTube Live?
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.180]   - Okay, so don't tell anybody, but we're on Twitch right now.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.380]   Because we were on Justin TV,
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.060]   and when Justin TV folded, we're on Twitch.
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.740]   And even though Twitch says it shouldn't,
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.780]   if it's not gaming content, it shouldn't.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.980]   But it's been a year.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.460]   So we're actually thinking,
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.180]   well, maybe we should tell people about this
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.420]   'cause they don't seem to want to get rid of us.
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:10.780]   I like it, I don't mind it.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.980]   I do like the idea that Google is using HTML5 and not Flash.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:18.100]   We always say, well, Leo, you're so against Flash.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.740]   Why are your streams in Flash?
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.340]   Well, 'cause we don't do the streams.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:23.940]   You stream and BitGravity does.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:27.780]   And we actually do pay for a non-Flash stream
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.180]   from FlowSuff for iOS users
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:32.100]   'cause there's no other way you could watch it.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.420]   But, and in fact, I can watch it on my Android device.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.940]   If I go to twitch.tv/live, that's an HLS stream
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.660]   'cause there's no Flash on here.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:41.380]   I would love to have more options,
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.740]   non-Flash options out there.
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:47.340]   So, but we did have conversations early on with YouTube Live
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.620]   and they said, well, if you're gonna have commercials,
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.580]   you can't be on YouTube Live.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.420]   What?
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.100]   Oh, they want you to use AdSense.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.860]   You have to use their commercials.
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:55.700]   Great.
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:56.540]   Not your commercials.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.740]   So it's a profit deal.
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:00.300]   It says a profit deal, eh?
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.300]   Unbelievable.
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.860]   So in terms of competition with Twitch,
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:07.780]   Twitch should be scared because every streamer
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:11.220]   and every viewer on Twitch also uses YouTube.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.980]   So like streamers already use YouTube live.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.300]   Why not?
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.060]   Our streams and all that.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:19.740]   So there's definitely, the market is definitely there
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:20.740]   for YouTube to capture.
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:22.460]   They're already going to the site.
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.740]   They just need to not go back to Twitch.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:28.740]   But Twitch has apps on like gaming consoles.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:32.220]   Like you can stream directly from a PS4 or Xbox to Twitch.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:36.820]   And you can watch on gaming consoles and all that.
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:41.820]   Where Twitch is only from a PC or some kind of weird box
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:45.380]   that somebody makes to, or I mean, YouTube gaming
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:49.660]   is only from a PC or some kind of weird box onto YouTube.
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.500]   So they still have a lot of ways to go
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.500]   to get on all of those different gaming platforms out there.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:16:00.420]   So like you say, I'll go ahead, Jeff.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:06.180]   Oh, there's no, there's no like subscription services
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.060]   or ways to pay streamers money.
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:10.380]   Oh, interesting.
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.340]   And Twitch has all that stuff.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:14.620]   So the monetization options, you kind of either
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:17.580]   have to use AdSense or have to go offsite
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.860]   and send people to PayPal or something.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:23.700]   So this is live stream from my Note 5.
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:28.940]   Wow, streaming live content.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.780]   You should look into that.
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.900]   That's an interesting concept.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.060]   Viewers will be able to seek back up to four hours.
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:35.380]   That's what you were talking about, Ron,
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:37.180]   while you're streaming.
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.020]   This is kind of neat.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.980]   Optimize for interaction.
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:43.260]   Low latency optimized for less viewer buffering.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.980]   You can actually set the latency.
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.380]   This is pretty nice.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.580]   And then for monetization, you say monetize me, baby.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:55.860]   Well, I just have to find a game that I'm really bad at.
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:01.700]   I think I'm thinking that Goat Z,
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.460]   maybe the zombie goat game.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:05.660]   Grand Theft Auto.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:10.260]   I think we should just watch Twitch on Twitch
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:12.100]   while we're playing a game.
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.100]   Yeah, mysteries.
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:16.100]   I always wanted to do a Twitter poker style.
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:20.100]   Like the poker TV shows where we're all playing poker
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.260]   and talking about tech.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:24.700]   I don't want to see Devorak play poker.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:26.580]   I feel like he'd be an interesting poker player.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.780]   -Twip. -It would be.
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:30.660]   He'd probably turn the table over a few times, but...
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.060]   You call that a hand?
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:35.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.060]   Have a couple aces under the table.
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:40.060]   No, you'd want somebody to cheat it.
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:44.060]   Tech stocks took a big hit this week.
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:47.060]   No fault of theirs, but weakness in China.
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:51.060]   Although Tim Cook called Jim Kramer of mad money
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.060]   to reassure him that in fact,
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.060]   no, the iPhone selling quite well in China.
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:57.060]   I guess the feeling was if China's collapsing,
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:00.060]   then many of the tech companies will suffer as well.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:05.060]   Google was down 4%.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.060]   I don't know what it's at right now.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.060]   -So I just... -Oh, it's all come back.
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.060]   It's all come back.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.060]   It's all come back today.
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:12.060]   It's the largest since 2011.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:14.060]   I tweeted my stock market analysis just now.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.060]   Oh, what is it?
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:19.060]   -Do you want to... -The analysis was never mine.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.060]   It's a visual.
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.060]   It's a visual.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.060]   Oh, it's a visual?
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.060]   All right, let me go to Twitter.
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.060]   This is why I don't like covering stock time.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.060]   Because it's like, okay, it went way down,
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.060]   then it went way back up, and now it's like...
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.060]   Yeah, I hate it too.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:30.060]   It's not worth the effort.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:32.060]   Everybody panicked and then realized they were done
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.060]   for panicking.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.060]   Exactly.
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:35.060]   Oh, here it is.
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.060]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.060]   It was very brief.
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.060]   Turn up my audio.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.060]   And here it is.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:43.060]   Jeff's response.
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.060]   Never met.
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.060]   Never met.
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.060]   Oh, shit.
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:48.060]   It's a bad-headed job by somebody.
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:52.060]   So the real question that's been bandied about this week
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:55.060]   is whether Tim Cook's email to Jim Kramer
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:59.060]   was a violation of SEC Fair Disclosure Regulations.
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.060]   We talked about that.
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.060]   I know you talked a lot about it on TNT on Tuesday.
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.060]   We talked about it on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:06.060]   The consensus was he didn't give Kramer any information
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:10.060]   that had not already been published by Apple in their advisories.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:13.060]   But even if it did, what's the difference?
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.060]   Who cares?
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:17.060]   Like, they'll move the stock by how many billions of dollars.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.060]   They could.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.060]   It made a huge difference.
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:20.060]   Okay, but how much are they going to find him?
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.060]   And compared to how much benefit there was for Apple for him to do that.
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:25.060]   Even if there was a...
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.060]   I think I put him in jail.
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.060]   They're not going to do that.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:29.060]   But they could.
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:31.060]   Martha Stewart went to jail.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.060]   Why couldn't Tim Cook go to jail for the same thing?
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.060]   I know Martha Stewart.
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.060]   Martha Stewart's a friend of mine.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.060]   And Tim Cook is no Martha Stewart.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.060]   You know Martha Stewart?
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.060]   No, I don't.
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:40.060]   It's just how the line goes.
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.060]   I do.
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:43.060]   Do you know Martha Stewart?
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:46.060]   I love that meme that went around a couple of years ago
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.060]   with Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart were cooking together.
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:52.060]   And the caption was, "One of these is a convicted felon."
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.060]   Yeah, not the one you think.
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.060]   No, they have some pretty big sticks they can wield.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:00.060]   But if the SEC feels that it was insider training.
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.060]   Because Kramer's a journalist and did immediately tell it,
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.060]   reported on the Today Show.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.060]   He's also an Apple investor.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.060]   I think, well I understand.
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:09.060]   Yeah, but Cook knew he was telling the public when he told Kramer.
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:13.060]   Tell him the press is a way to tell the public.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.060]   Right.
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:17.060]   It would be different if he called Jim and said, "Just on the QT, Jim."
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:21.060]   I knew you were broadcasting live right now, but don't tell him.
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.060]   Right.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.060]   Kramer also went to him as a reporter as a journalist.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.060]   I said, "I'm going to be on the Today Show.
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.060]   What would you like me to say?"
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.060]   Or, "What would you like me to tell people you're saying?"
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.060]   Now, an Apple did it.
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.060]   I didn't say.
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.060]   Oh, I'm sure everybody's back.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:35.060]   There's still the story.
[01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:37.060]   The China is trouble for Apple.
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.060]   Because that's where their sales growth is coming from.
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.060]   That's right.
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:41.060]   Well, that seems...
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:42.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.060]   So Apple is up 5.7%.
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:46.060]   There you go.
[01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:47.060]   I don't know.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.060]   9.69.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.060]   And by the way, when you get these big 4 and 5% moves in companies like Google and Apple,
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:53.060]   you're talking tens of billions of dollars.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:54.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:58.060]   I mean, we always say that, but does it really...
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:20:59.060]   Just out of curiosity.
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:02.060]   It's not like somebody made that or lost that, right?
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:06.060]   I mean, it's like you don't get a check at the end of the week from Google.
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:10.620]   Google send you a check saying, or they don't, you know, Larry and Sergey don't get a check
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:13.620]   saying, "Hey, here's your $62 billion."
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:18.780]   It's just the market value, the market cap.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:23.500]   We don't invest because, well, Jeff does, but like 50 bucks worth.
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:25.060]   We're not allowed to invest.
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:27.100]   We don't allow ourselves to invest.
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.100]   And we...
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.100]   I have some stocks.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.500]   We know how foolish it would be.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:36.100]   Meanwhile in Germany...
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:41.500]   Is taking a picture of food violating the chef's copyright?
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.500]   I love this.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:46.700]   Which I added back in there today, mainly because Google Maps is now asking you for your restaurant
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:50.900]   food photos, but in Germany, they say that if you take a picture of the chef's food, the
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:54.260]   chef owns the copyright of the vision of the plate.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:55.260]   Do some...
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.260]   Some are...
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.260]   Good lord.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.260]   I know.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.260]   Good lord.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.260]   It's another German story.
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:01.260]   What the hell?
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.260]   You can't make these up.
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:03.260]   You can't resist them.
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:04.260]   They're such fun.
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:10.180]   For carefully arranged food in a famous restaurant, the cook is regarded as a creator of a work.
[01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:12.180]   What if it's not carefully arranged?
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.180]   You know what?
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.780]   I see America's got to hit them back.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:17.940]   Every time a German takes a picture of a big Mac or an order flies...
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.660]   That's carefully arranged.
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:21.060]   And it's a famous restaurant.
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.060]   Yes.
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:23.060]   Ronald McDonald.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.540]   And you bought that copyright.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.700]   You have a right to use that food as you will.
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.060]   If you don't want to eat it, you want to take a picture of it, that's your right.
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:31.580]   You paid for it.
[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:34.900]   Maybe you just get licensed the food and don't retain the...
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:35.900]   That's right.
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.700]   That's right.
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.740]   That's the new technology way.
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:45.060]   But even if you're like the most insane copyright enforcer, this kind of completely disregards
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.980]   all of that photography stuff that, you know, the photographers should have a right to
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:49.980]   copyright too.
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.980]   You know, you have composition and lighting.
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.980]   True.
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:53.980]   And all this other stuff.
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:54.980]   I mean, it's completely insane.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:57.820]   But if we're going to be insane, go all the way.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:01.380]   And they should have like a joint copyright over the picture or something.
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:02.620]   What about modification to the work?
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.820]   What if you take a bite and then it's like...
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:06.820]   That's right.
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.500]   Has anybody seen this Google map pop up that says...
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.500]   No, I haven't either.
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.020]   I see you're eating at a restaurant.
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.020]   Take a picture of the food.
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.060]   I don't think we should encourage this.
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.820]   No, I like it.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:23.060]   I think it's more data to know what the restaurant's like.
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.060]   I like this a lot.
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.740]   Well, as an obsessive food picture taker of...
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.740]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.740]   I think this is great.
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:34.380]   But what this is yet, I think the Google angle here is how bizarre Google's world of food
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.420]   photography, et cetera, is.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.100]   They got zagat.
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:39.180]   They bought that.
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.700]   They folded it into maps.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:41.900]   They folded it into Google+.
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:44.140]   They started adding their own stuff to it.
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:46.340]   Now they don't really pitch it as zagat.
[01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:47.980]   Now they ripped it out of Google+.
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.780]   Now it's in maps and you can upload photos.
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.900]   And nobody knows how to do it.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:58.340]   And plus, when you go to a restaurant's listing or whatever and you see all these photos, it's
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.260]   going to be another problem where people are going to be gaming it with more...
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.420]   I have lots of beautiful...
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:06.340]   When I eat at a nice restaurant, I take pictures of the food.
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:07.340]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:08.740]   It's like food in a search bar.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.460]   Oh, golly.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:13.620]   You really know how to use this stuff, don't you?
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:14.620]   You're so good.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:15.780]   Look at that.
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:18.340]   That's a lovely, lovely meal.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:23.140]   I took pictures of my herring in Copenhagen last time.
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:24.140]   This is Stockholm.
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:27.900]   This is actually a dessert.
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:28.900]   It's a luscious dessert.
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:30.900]   This is the chef know you're posting this.
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.180]   Jesse's going to sue me.
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.340]   Because I can tell he put a lot of effort into that.
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:36.340]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:37.340]   He's a little gold-plated food.
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:39.300]   Oh, I remember when you shot those, yeah.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.700]   Yeah, this is at Madrana Manor, which is...
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.980]   Well, but Leo, I remember you took pictures of Vorst and Germany.
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:45.980]   You were coming after you.
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:46.980]   No, I did.
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:47.980]   You're right.
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:50.780]   I've posted German versus pictures.
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.140]   Can I type...
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:53.140]   Broadforsed in here?
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:54.140]   That's a trap.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:56.340]   Look, here's a food spotting photo.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.940]   You can actually type in delicious food and it will sort the delicious...
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.340]   No, you're lying to me now.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:03.340]   It knows.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:04.340]   Google knows everything.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:06.500]   I type in indigestion memories.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.700]   Sausages, let's see.
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.180]   No results for sausages.
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:11.100]   Well, type in the city.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:13.260]   It was in Reagensburg, I think.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:17.660]   You could do food in city or food in country or something.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:18.660]   Oh, you can?
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:19.660]   Oh.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:20.660]   Food.
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:21.660]   Let's see.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:22.660]   Food in Germany.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.660]   Try that.
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:24.660]   In Germany.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:25.660]   See, this is why...
[01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.660]   Boom.
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:27.660]   Nothing.
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:30.380]   The right to be forgotten is what I was trying to do.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:31.380]   You know what?
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:32.380]   I wonder.
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.380]   Well, did you have your location?
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:34.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.100]   There it is.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:37.260]   That's not in Germany, but...
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:38.340]   You had bacon in Germany?
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.180]   I don't think so.
[01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:41.180]   I don't know where...
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.780]   That's not even my bacon.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:47.500]   There's some strangers bacon in my Google feed.
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.500]   They saved somebody's bacon, but unfortunately they saved it in your...
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:51.500]   It's definitely not food.
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:52.900]   Well, it is a restaurant.
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:53.900]   I guess that counts.
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:54.900]   It looks German.
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:55.900]   It is German.
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:59.900]   It's still Germany.
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.300]   But this notification pop up, your normal people aren't going to see it.
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:06.540]   It's just your test going out to...
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:07.540]   Okay.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:11.660]   They're called Google Maps Local Guides, so like really heavy reviewers.
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:12.660]   Oh, right.
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:14.340]   They're like level three.
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:16.940]   It's like Scientology.
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:20.940]   You rise in the levels.
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:24.940]   So, yeah, it's going out to some of these people and it's just kind of an experiment.
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:31.020]   And in the notification, like right at the bottom is a feedback link to say, "Hey, what
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:33.980]   do you think of us asking for your pictures?"
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:35.940]   Because, you know, it's interesting.
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.940]   Usually Google just kind of takes the data in the background and now they just kind of
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:41.620]   pop up and say, "Hey, will you please send us the data?"
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:47.700]   But it's interesting because, you know, you take a lot of photos and the assumption is
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.500]   that they all need to be private.
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:53.100]   And I guess if I take a picture of food, it really doesn't need to be private.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:58.420]   So, I mean, if it helps a restaurant review, I guess it's cool.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:26:59.980]   It's interesting, though.
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:06.660]   Brian Krabs, Krabs on security, digging deep into the Ashley Madison hack, noticed that
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:13.460]   he had received a tweet after he published his exclusive story with a link to the cache
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:18.060]   of data that had been confidentially shared with him from the hackers.
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:21.780]   A link no one else knew.
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:25.100]   He said initially that tweet startled me because I couldn't find any other sites online that
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.980]   were actually linking to the source code cache.
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:34.860]   He began looking through past tweets of Tadeo's Zoo, found a lot of hacking information,
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:40.620]   a lot of guys apparently have very prolific tweeter.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:44.820]   He thinks that Zoo might actually have something to do with the impact team.
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:46.740]   It's a great story.
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:50.980]   This is why we love Brian Krabs, not only a great writer on security, but he gets in
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:57.780]   there, gets down in the trenches, and kind of starts looking at this stuff.
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:02.540]   So he's put together an interesting story, which I highly recommend reading.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.860]   Who hacked Ashley Madison?
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:10.260]   He thinks maybe he might know.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.260]   Let's take a break.
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:12.260]   Come back.
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:17.500]   Lots more to talk about with our fine team of experts like Elgin's here from Tech News
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.500]   tonight.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.500]   And today.
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:20.500]   And today.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.060]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:25.100]   Tonight, today, tomorrow, forever.
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.820]   Ron and Mario from ours, technically.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.620]   Tada, a year.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:29.620]   A year?
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:30.620]   A year.
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:31.620]   Jeff Jarvis from QME.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.620]   Yeah, QME.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:36.780]   Are you studying Spanish, aren't you?
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:37.780]   Yes, I am.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:38.780]   How's that going?
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.020]   37 days into the Pimpler method, and it's really pretty amazing.
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:43.420]   Nice.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:44.420]   You were reading an article.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.420]   I'm not a ball.
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.420]   Doing a lot of ball.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.420]   Well, I got a headline again much farther, but done.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:49.420]   Let's just start.
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:50.420]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:51.420]   It's good.
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:52.420]   I can.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.420]   It's studio español.
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.420]   It's studio español.
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:59.020]   Do you are you learning with the list for a lot or not?
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:00.020]   No, not really.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:05.420]   Flat Americans, Spanish.
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:09.460]   Let's take a break and talk about JustWorks.com.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:13.460]   If you run a business or you work in the HR department about the business, you know
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:20.500]   how hard it is to manage all of that payroll and human resources and benefits.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.660]   Wouldn't you like a little help?
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.940]   Well, I've got a suggestion for you.
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.620]   JustWorks.
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:27.820]   JustWorks helps businesses.
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:31.820]   Take care of their benefits, their payroll, their HR.
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:35.180]   So you can focus on the reason you started the business.
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.620]   You don't want to deal with paperwork.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.620]   With JustWorks, you're equipped to take care of your team.
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.020]   They've got great software.
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:43.660]   It's one of the reasons people love JustWorks.
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:46.020]   It's software is so elegant.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:51.940]   It makes it easy to automate payroll, to do compliance, to grow your business, not your
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:52.940]   busy work.
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:57.780]   The average setup time, if you go to JustWorks.com right now, just three minutes.
[01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:58.780]   Casper uses it.
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:05.460]   A lot of the companies that we talk about, the cutting edge startups, imprint, reboot.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:06.460]   So what are you waiting for?
[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:10.820]   Go to JustWorks.com and request a demo or sign up, find out how you can offer your team
[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:16.260]   the benefits they want at prices you can't afford.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:17.260]   JustWorks.com.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.260]   You see, off-road, twig it, check out.
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:20.820]   You'll get 15% off your first year of services.
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:22.220]   That's nice.
[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:23.620]   That's nice.
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:25.260]   JustWorks.com.
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:26.260]   Off-road, twig.
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:31.700]   Let me thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:35.620]   So was it last week during the show that I started getting the Android Wear download?
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.620]   When did I get it?
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:38.300]   Maybe it was during Twit.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.460]   People were talking about the new Android Wear 1.3.
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:46.780]   I have the LG-- what do they call this?
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:47.780]   The Grande?
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:48.780]   G-Watch R.
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:49.780]   No, this is not your name.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:50.780]   The Langer of the Urbain.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:51.780]   This is the Urbain.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.780]   The Langer of the Urbain.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.780]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:58.220]   So I could show you the bits watch face, which is, I think, the first one.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.580]   Jason, you're going to have to help me out here.
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:04.580]   This is interactive, which means now you can tap the watch face.
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.220]   So I have two-- here's the watch face.
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:12.180]   Tap it and it will grow into a clock, but I can tap the missed messages and it will
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.420]   grow into a bigger thing.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:14.420]   I don't--
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:15.820]   So I don't have the update.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:19.660]   So I'm actually watching you do it and learning from what you're doing.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:26.540]   How do you do-- is it possible to do the tap-- like the normal action of tapping the watch
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:29.700]   face and having that pull up the menu or do you have to swipe for the menu now?
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:33.780]   Well, this watch face is dopey.
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:36.940]   But there are third party watch faces coming that do some of this stuff.
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:38.980]   For instance, I use-- I really like this.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:41.940]   This is a weather face and it's already interactive.
[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:42.940]   It's a little bright.
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:43.940]   It's hard to see.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:44.940]   But I have the time here.
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:47.580]   If I tap that, nothing happens.
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:48.580]   So that's really cool.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:53.220]   If I tap the weather, then I get a full weather forecast.
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:55.700]   You can't really see this very well, can you?
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.700]   You can get the picture.
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:00.740]   What's stupid about it is it tells me that I have 12,000 email messages.
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:01.940]   Well, yeah, you don't want that.
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:04.460]   But that's because that's a dumb-- so it could be done better.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:08.500]   So when I tap the time here, I actually get my agenda and there's my calendar and I can
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.940]   scroll through it.
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:13.940]   So the idea is-- and this is, believe it or not, Apple Watch fans are saying, what
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:14.940]   are you talking about?
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:15.940]   What's so what?
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:18.460]   This has never been available in the past.
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:24.580]   This idea of being able to use the watch face as a call to something else.
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:29.740]   Yeah, I think Android Wear's biggest problem has been that Google's been the only company
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:32.740]   that's been able to touch the user interface.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:37.900]   And yeah, they made the watch face just like you click it and the voice command thing comes
[01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:39.660]   up where the menu pops up.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:44.420]   And this is the first time yet that developers have been able to add buttons and make different
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.700]   things happen depending on where you touch.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:49.180]   So I'm sure there are more interactive faces coming out all the time.
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:53.140]   The first one you get is part of the Android Wear app is that silly bits thing.
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:58.340]   But I actually like this is called Weather Face or something like that.
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:03.740]   And you mentioned the LG Watch R. If you do have that first LG Watch, the first round
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.820]   one, it weirdly added Wi-Fi support.
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:09.820]   Apparently Wi-Fi support wasn't in there initially.
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:16.060]   So just like the Moto 360, it's kind of-- the radio was in there but nobody knew about it.
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:19.220]   This is called Weather Time.
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.540]   I like Weather Face better.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:22.780]   I like Weather Face better, don't you?
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.980]   I've been called worse.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:26.940]   Well, you see, it has now interaction settings.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.140]   So I can enable interactions.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:31.340]   I can have a weather icon, calendar icon, date icon.
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.380]   So you can't do a whole lot with it.
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:34.940]   But this came out right away.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:37.860]   So I imagine there'll be soon more interactive faces.
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.860]   Does this erode your skepticism about the category?
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:41.860]   Not in the most recent.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:42.860]   I think the category--
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:43.860]   What do you think?
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:44.860]   What do you think?
[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:45.860]   Is this more complex and more confusing?
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:46.860]   No, this isn't bad.
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:51.260]   I mean, the Apple Watch is really, in my opinion, just crazy complex.
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:54.820]   They've got two buttons, force touch.
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:56.340]   Different things do different things.
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:34:03.860]   To me, it's-- but it's an attempt to take a really tiny device and make it useful.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:06.620]   And that's the same thing with this.
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:11.380]   I just feel-- wearables, I love the idea of wearables.
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:15.580]   I've never seen an execution of wearables from Google Glass to smart watches that makes
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.140]   it much sense.
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:22.020]   When I said that, I get a lot of people who email me saying, like Jorge, who's in our
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:25.020]   audience right now, who said, but it's the best fitness watch I ever had.
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:27.820]   Yeah, there are some uses, certainly use cases.
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:29.500]   A friend is a nurse.
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:30.500]   She's on her feet a lot.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.380]   She can't pull her phone out at the hospital, but she can always check her watch.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:38.260]   So for those people, smart watches maybe makes some sense.
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:41.220]   I'm excited about smart hearing aids.
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:42.220]   Yeah, me too.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:43.220]   Hearables.
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.220]   What?
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:45.220]   The hearable mark that I said.
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:51.620]   I feel like that actually might have some legs, but again, I'm not saying that they
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:56.060]   won't at some point, but right now, if you're sitting on the sideline saying, "Should I get
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:57.060]   a wearable?"
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.620]   I'd say no.
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:03.660]   Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket, you don't know what to do.
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:04.660]   Right.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:07.140]   I mean, the notifications are nice.
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:11.820]   The ability to do texting and messaging with people from your wrist is nice.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.220]   A couple of other things are nice.
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:15.180]   It's not a mind-blower.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.180]   It's not like...
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.860]   I feel like I get all that from my phone.
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:18.860]   Yeah.
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:21.060]   So I'm not sure why I need a second device to do all that.
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:22.060]   Would you...
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:23.060]   Would you tomorrow just stop wearing a...
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.060]   I don't wear it.
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:25.060]   I really would.
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:27.860]   I'm wearing it today because I wanted to show you the interaction.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.780]   I have my bedside table.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:33.540]   I have an Apple watch and an Android Wear watch just sitting there charging in case I need
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:37.100]   them because I wear the Apple Watch for iOS today because we talk about iOS devices.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.820]   And I wear the Android Wear watch when I want to show something.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:45.420]   But truthfully, I think the future of wearables is multiple wearables.
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:50.140]   So if you have something built in your glasses and a wristwatch and a wearable device, you'll
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:51.140]   sort of...
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:52.300]   You'll be the computer at some point.
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.700]   You'll have a pan, personal area, network and stuff.
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:55.700]   Do you mention wearables?
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:36:00.340]   Doppler Labs here, Active Listening System, which I'm sure we've talked about on various
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:01.340]   shows.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:05.860]   This is an interesting new category because it combines multiple features.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:10.260]   One of them is for you to be able to custom tailor what you hear.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.460]   So one of these in this...
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:15.140]   Well, the Doppler itself has a "reduce baby" button.
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:16.140]   Right.
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.140]   So you're on an airplane, baby screaming.
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:18.940]   You could put your phone in the baby goes away.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:21.020]   I have a friend who's watched Ties to his iPhone.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.020]   He can have...
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.100]   It geolocates.
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:27.460]   So when he walks into a certain kind of restaurant, it changes the equalization.
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:29.060]   I'm actually going to the audiologist tomorrow.
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:30.980]   I'm hoping that I need hearing aids because I...
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:31.980]   Yes.
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:32.980]   Yes.
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:36.420]   There's a couple of companies, Starkey is another company that's really on the cutting
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.580]   edge of this stuff.
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:38.580]   Some of these...
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:43.420]   It's easy for a hearing aid to measure your heart rate, but they may be able to do a
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:44.420]   lot more.
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:47.020]   I mean, again, this is all, again, early days.
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:50.300]   This was a kickstarter, the Broggy Dash.
[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:51.300]   These are Bluetooth...
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:52.300]   This isn't a hearing aid.
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:53.300]   These are Bluetooth speakers.
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:57.300]   Although, in my opinion, there's a fine line between them.
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:01.300]   One of the reasons I wouldn't mind wearing hearing aids today is because I could use
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.300]   them as headphones during the radio show.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:05.700]   I could use them to listen to music.
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:07.660]   I mean, this is a whole game.
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:12.220]   There's no question in my mind that hearing aids are about to become obsolete because
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:18.660]   the difference between a hearable device that's customizable for a 22-year-old is the same
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:25.060]   device that somebody who's 90 is going to need as a replacement for their hearing aids.
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:29.100]   One of these devices is called the Soundhawk Smart Listening System.
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:30.780]   It actually comes with a separate microphone.
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.180]   You can put the microphone anywhere.
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:36.500]   You can put it up on the stage and then go back and take your seat and you'll have the
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:40.580]   best audio experience of anybody in the building.
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:41.580]   And this...
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:42.660]   I think that's great.
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:43.660]   I think it's great, too.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:50.540]   And the other thing, if I can introduce a new word into the world of geek lingo, the word
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.180]   is "disappearable."
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:56.740]   So I think we're on the verge of having a category of disappearables where you can't tell somebody's
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:57.740]   had some of you.
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:58.740]   That's why I want it.
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:02.300]   I don't need something on my wrist or on my glasses.
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:05.140]   And I don't need a user interface because these things are too small to really have
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:06.740]   a good user interface.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:10.940]   I want something that, well, and Dr. Mom says anything in your ear can measure heart rate,
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:12.740]   body temperature, blood oxygen levels.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:13.740]   Yes.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:15.740]   My problem is it won't stay in my damn ear.
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:17.700]   Well, these are molded.
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:18.700]   They have...
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:19.700]   So that's why I'm going to the audiologist.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:20.700]   They're going to make molds.
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:21.700]   And they have surgical screws that will go right into your...
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:22.700]   And they screw right into your bone.
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:23.700]   Nice.
[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:24.700]   I don't know.
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:25.700]   I'm looking at that.
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:26.700]   Nice.
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:27.700]   So my head's that just...
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:30.700]   There's no room for battery in those.
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:35.980]   Like any kind of Bluetooth headphones, you get have like a big plastic chunk somewhere
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.980]   usually.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:37.980]   Not anymore.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:38.980]   These braggies, the batteries in the braggy.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:39.980]   And I agree with you.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:42.620]   That's one of the issues that has to be solved.
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:45.900]   They're going to last like two hours.
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:52.700]   And this takes advantage of a new Bluetooth profile.
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:56.140]   And it takes advantage of the fact that you have a fairly powerful computer in your pocket.
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:59.180]   It has a touch pad on the hearing device.
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:00.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:01.940]   So it's like personal interest.
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.940]   You touch your ear and then like...
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:05.620]   That's the only thing in your ear.
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:10.940]   The problem is every time I can't get it in, I try to push it into the ear, of course that
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:11.940]   disconnects the call.
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:12.940]   Right.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:13.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:14.940]   Right.
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:15.940]   Pisses me off every damn time.
[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:16.940]   Well, this is just broke.
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:17.940]   I have recommendations.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:25.140]   I am clear that this is early as early as the watch is as early as Google Glass was.
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:26.140]   Yeah.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:28.820]   I do feel like wearables.
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:29.820]   And maybe multiple wearables.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.820]   I love the idea of invisible wearables.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:36.380]   Because I don't want to look like that guy with that guy.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:38.300]   Here's the killer feature.
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:40.020]   Here's the killer feature for this category.
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:46.460]   Essentially what they do is they record digitally what you hear, run it through a signal processor
[01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:50.780]   and then spit it out almost instantaneously whispering it into your ear.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:52.860]   Imagine Google Translate built it.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:55.260]   Google Translate and Google Now, et cetera.
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:56.940]   But here's the killer feature.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:57.940]   You can Tivo thing.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:58.940]   Somebody said something.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.180]   You didn't quite catch it.
[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:01.180]   You can rewind it.
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:02.180]   What?
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:03.180]   A?
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.180]   And that'll rewind it.
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:05.180]   Exactly.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.180]   All my father needs that.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:07.180]   Aye.
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:08.180]   No, I need it all the time.
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.180]   Is that my bull the braggy?
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.180]   No, this doesn't.
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:13.700]   This is these are these are basically Bluetooth headphones.
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:17.620]   A company called Starkey is apparently doing some work in this area.
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:20.980]   They're a very well known hearing aid company.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:24.540]   But they are doing some very interesting wearable stuff too.
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:28.540]   I would imagine that any forward thinking hearing aid company is going to be looking
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:35.020]   at what these capabilities could be.
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:39.420]   And it just makes sense that this is in your anyway, I'm going to see what I can get.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.260]   It's not that I'm completely deaf.
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:43.620]   I'm definitely have some hearing loss.
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:46.260]   Does having to wear these things in your entire career?
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:48.100]   Does that have an impact on your hearing aid?
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:49.100]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:50.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:51.100]   Absolutely.
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:52.660]   But it's mostly like anybody my age and your age.
[01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:56.180]   The high end is gone.
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.540]   So my phone a little more mundane.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.460]   My phone had said broke.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:02.060]   Any recommendations?
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:03.140]   You hated that Motorola thing.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.900]   I returned the Motorola thing on open.
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:05.900]   Hint.
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:08.700]   Well, I didn't hate it, but it didn't live up to its promise.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:10.980]   We always liked the plantronics.
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:15.380]   Jawbone has always made some great stuff.
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:17.180]   Who else do I like?
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:18.180]   I can't remember.
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:19.180]   It's been a while.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:20.340]   Nobody wears I know.
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.260]   I use wired.
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:24.860]   Because the wireless, it's always been problems, right?
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.500]   I just I use wired headphones.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.660]   Well, you probably in your car use the cars.
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:30.660]   Yeah, I don't have it all.
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:31.660]   And I use the car.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:35.460]   But you use wired headphones and put in one ear.
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:36.860]   Another wire, I believe I got so many wires.
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:39.660]   And then the microphone instead just like on I wouldn't use the Apple ones.
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:44.540]   I use edamotics, but the microphones right there instead of up here, which is not a great
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:46.220]   place to put the microphone up by your ear.
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:48.780]   It's down on your chest.
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:49.780]   Disappeared.
[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:52.780]   Disappearable.
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:54.780]   I'll take picture of my car.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:55.780]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:56.780]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:57.780]   Disappearables.
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:41:58.780]   It's a little too many syllables.
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:41:59.780]   Yeah.
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.780]   Pearables.
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:04.300]   Invisibles.
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:05.300]   I like wired.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:08.500]   I think I think I bet you a lot of people who used to use Bluetooth are going.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.580]   Yeah, it's just the wired.
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:18.420]   Um, so you saw a little bit of news in the rundown at the bottom there is that.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:21.580]   Um, stubble upon.
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:23.020]   I thought they went out of business.
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:24.020]   Nope.
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:25.380]   They got taken over by a co-founder.
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:30.420]   Oh, I Garrett and he's returning and he's going to fix it.
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:32.980]   Good because that was a, that's one of those things.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:39.020]   It was a classic in its day, but it, it 2001 a gear founded it.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.020]   Yeah, gear.
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.540]   So this was, this was up since we went on the air.
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:45.260]   It was a product I was excited about when that helped people find content.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:49.460]   Boy, time, time, the years left stumble upon behind.
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:50.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:54.860]   I wonder what stumble upon could be today.
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:58.020]   Does anybody still, did somebody still get a good amount of traffic from stumble?
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:42:59.020]   Do you get really?
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:06.100]   They're one of these things, operating background and they've always been a big solid driver
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.100]   of traffic.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.340]   By the way, Garrett has some money.
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:10.940]   He was a co-founder of Uber.
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:14.700]   So he left stumble upon, created Uber.
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:19.980]   I will tell you this, the stumble upon traffic is down 50% from last year.
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:21.740]   Good job, stumble upon.
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:22.740]   Nice job.
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:25.220]   But still you don't want to, you don't want to unplug that.
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:26.220]   Yeah.
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:30.860]   I, I had to put this in Jeff, I just for your benefit.
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:33.460]   TV channel guide from the future wrecks.
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:34.460]   Yes.
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:35.460]   This is organ.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.940]   This is what television will look like in five years.
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:44.660]   The channels are Vice, which has Vice, Vice News, Vice News, Planet Vice, Vice News.
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:47.620]   Vice, Vice, Vice, Vice.
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.420]   Live from Williamsburg.
[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:56.420]   Uh, Fox explained, piece in the Middle East for dummies, explained what was Wikipedia,
[01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:00.180]   explained this infographic will make you invincible.
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:05.540]   Buzzfeed, hashtag squad quiz, what Taylor Swift friend are you?
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:12.580]   The dress is, give me the game show hosted by Zave Frank, blue or black, 30 things all
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.260]   butanese American millennials know.
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:19.700]   Then there's the eater channel EATR.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:24.860]   You've got Momo Fomo, David Chang's amazing new food invention that you fear missing out
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:25.860]   on.
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:29.580]   Momo Fomo next, Bordein off the wagon.
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:34.900]   This week, Anthony Bordein shoots smack and tear on.
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:35.900]   This sounds dirty.
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:38.500]   It's not glory hole with Danny Meyer.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:43.140]   Is that a shack burger or pulled pork in your mouth?
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.660]   I'll leave that to your imagination.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:51.220]   Iron Chef Guy Fieri versus Paula Dean in battle rat.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:54.100]   New York Times tweet and snap and grahman.
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:57.260]   CSI, sell of you threes enough.
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:45:01.220]   A styles trend report with Alex Williams hate watch starring Alice Andrews.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:04.780]   This is just too insider, but it's really fun.
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:09.260]   And YouTube, of course, has an eight hour block America's funniest home videos awards
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:11.380]   and then Vivo after dark.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:19.220]   Uber, they just show taxi reruns all day.
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:24.180]   This may be what TV looks like coming going ahead and including HBO with Sesame Street
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:29.180]   Tribeca, Sesame Street, Hampton's and True Detective Leviton.
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:33.420]   I don't know, it's too inside, but I love it.
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:34.420]   It's good.
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:36.580]   It's very well done.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:39.060]   That's Rex Sorgatz.
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:42.100]   We're just going through a couple of really quick.
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:43.100]   This is kind of sad.
[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:46.060]   Rovio's firing 260 more people.
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:50.620]   You know, whoever thinks that a game company is going to be magic forever.
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:51.620]   I mean, I was jealous.
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:52.620]   Those guys were great.
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:53.620]   They were wonderful.
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:54.620]   Their sweatshirts were amazing.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:55.980]   They were smart, but it's a game.
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:56.980]   Same thing for.
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:46:00.900]   Oh, I need the airpiece to tell me what's going on here.
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:01.900]   What the?
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:02.900]   I think yeah.
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:04.220]   Yeah, same thing.
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:05.220]   One hit wonders.
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:07.060]   OMG, remember them?
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.060]   Yeah.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:10.700]   Just one hit wonders.
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:14.300]   But gosh, I thought Rovio might make it because everywhere you walk in New York City,
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.660]   you see Angry Birds hats.
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:19.900]   But of course, they're not paying license fees, are they?
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:21.660]   Sad they had 800 employees.
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.300]   They've now fired 370 of them since.
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:26.300]   800 employees for Angry Birds.
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:31.500]   That's probably the maybe the source of the problem.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:34.100]   The end for Angry Birds.
[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:36.780]   Now they're really angry.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:37.780]   Now they're really mad.
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:40.580]   Those biggies we're going to get them.
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:46.620]   Amazon's Fire TV's outsold Apple TV in 2014.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:48.100]   That doesn't even seem possible.
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:49.100]   No, it doesn't.
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:52.020]   Also, we never know what Amazon sells of anything.
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:53.020]   How do we know that?
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:54.500]   I, Amazon never reveals a thing.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:55.500]   This is from 9 to 5 Mac.
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.820]   This is from Parks Associates.
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:01.420]   But this is one of those things where everybody who wanted an Apple TV got one.
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:02.420]   And they never changed it.
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:03.940]   It hasn't been changed in years.
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:04.940]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:06.420]   It's a timed thing.
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:07.900]   Roku is number one.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:13.260]   And Amazon can shove the fire in everyone's face when you go to buy whatever on Amazon.
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:18.380]   If you were to look at actual usage, the Apple TV would blow away.
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:22.260]   Tom with Apple TV is it's the Apple ecosystem.
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:25.140]   I want Amazon and I want Google.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:29.100]   I wish one device would do all of those there is none.
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:30.780]   Apple's the only device that does iTunes.
[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:34.620]   To borrowing that, I'll take the Google one because that's going to be the most open one.
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:36.860]   We mentioned smart things is coming to the Echo.
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:37.860]   That's good news.
[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:41.180]   That means you'll be able to control your home by talking to it.
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:42.180]   Yep.
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:45.900]   You know, Alexa can hear me all the way from the bedroom on the other side of the house.
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:46.900]   I just yell in a hall.
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:49.140]   When Alexa's playing loud music though, can it hear you?
[01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:50.140]   Yes, it can hear you.
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:51.420]   You can talk to it.
[01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:53.740]   You can raise and lower the volume by talking.
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:55.940]   But yeah, it'll be blasting loud music.
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:59.260]   And I'll just say, you know, Alexa gave me a five minute timer and I just set off a whole
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:01.260]   bunch of timers for everybody who's got Alexa.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.260]   Sorry.
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:03.620]   Yeah, we don't say that word.
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:05.580]   Yeah, no, we don't see that say the A word.
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:08.020]   You know, de Vorex spammed everybody on Twitter.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:09.660]   He kept saying all the words.
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:13.780]   And yelling things like Echo erase all files.
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:15.300]   Yeah, that's not nice.
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:17.780]   That's fortunately, that's not a real thing.
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:21.420]   Fortunately, you guys are you guys are selling me on this Amazon Echo thing.
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:23.140]   I'm telling you, you should get one.
[01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:24.380]   Everybody can now, right?
[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:25.940]   You know, they're cheap to 150.
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:28.580]   Well, they're more expensive than we when we bought them.
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:29.580]   Yeah, or 50 bucks.
[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:30.580]   But it's really.
[01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:31.660]   Can I get a second one now?
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:33.020]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.100]   Because that was one of the problems.
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:35.100]   You could only get one.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.100]   You have two.
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:37.100]   Kevin does my son Kevin.
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:38.100]   I was two.
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:39.100]   I have one in the bathroom.
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:41.100]   Because two in the bathroom.
[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.140]   They can talk to each other.
[01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:44.140]   But I really.
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:47.660]   So you're so lazy rather than taking a magazine in to read, you'll have to read to you.
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:48.660]   You know what you say?
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.660]   You say Echo, give me my news.
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:52.660]   And it gives you a news brief.
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:53.660]   Yeah.
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:56.260]   And you customize it, of course, as to the news sources you want.
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:59.420]   So you're saving 480 bucks now.
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:00.420]   Say again?
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:03.020]   Has it made any funny mistakes?
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:04.900]   Sometimes it just doesn't know what's going on.
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:07.500]   Or sometimes it just talks as if somebody talked to it.
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:08.700]   It's not that great.
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:12.980]   But you know, if you cook, if you do a lot of cooking, your hands, you know, I got my
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:14.740]   hands in dough or making cheese or whatever.
[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:15.740]   You need timers.
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.900]   You need this information.
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.700]   How many tablespoons in a minute?
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:19.860]   You're making cheese.
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:20.860]   You're making cheese.
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:21.860]   Yeah, making cheese.
[01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:22.860]   Making cheese.
[01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:23.860]   We have.
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:24.860]   I saw your wife was making butter.
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:26.860]   Butter, cheese, yogurt.
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.980]   If it comes out of a cow, you can buy it.
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:29.980]   You can just go to the store.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:32.180]   The stuff we make is so much better than what you buy.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:33.900]   Actually, homemade butter would be awesome.
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:34.900]   It is awesome.
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:35.900]   You know what?
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:36.900]   You know what Amira does?
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:37.900]   It's really smart.
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:38.900]   She doesn't just take cream, which I could do.
[01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:39.900]   Anybody could do.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:40.900]   Take heavy cream and whip it.
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:42.060]   Pass the whipped cream stage to the butter stage.
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:43.060]   She cultures it.
[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:44.260]   She lets it rot.
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:45.260]   She lets it rot.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:46.260]   She ferments it.
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:47.900]   And it's even more delicious.
[01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:50.220]   Why aren't you opening a restaurant?
[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:51.220]   I know.
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:52.220]   You should see.
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:56.660]   If you're not following Amira Elgin on Instagram.
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:57.780]   Best food pictures ever.
[01:49:57.780 --> 01:49:59.820]   What's my motivation, Jeff?
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.300]   There is a restaurant and I'm the only customer.
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:02.300]   He's the only customer.
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.620]   He gets a seat every time.
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:10.260]   Yeah, but no, see, we live on a farm and we now sort of have this.
[01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:13.660]   We milk the cow every other day and we get all the milk from this.
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:14.660]   We get a gallon and a half of milk.
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:16.420]   You have your own cow?
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:20.060]   The farmers that trade magic beans.
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:21.220]   Magic beans, yes.
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:22.220]   And yes.
[01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:23.220]   It's a giant opportunity.
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:25.300]   What happens on the other day, Mike?
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:27.460]   The farmers get the milk for their family.
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:28.700]   Every other day you get the milk?
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:29.700]   Every other day we get the cow.
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:30.700]   How much milk is it?
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:31.700]   A gallon and a half every other day.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:32.700]   Well, that's more than you want.
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:34.700]   That's why you're making so much cheese.
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:38.500]   Anything that reduces the volume of a gallon and a half.
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:39.500]   Geez.
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:40.500]   Oh my God.
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:41.500]   I'm telling you, it's a problem.
[01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:42.500]   It's like bring some in.
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:44.500]   All right.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.380]   I told you, if you opened a restaurant then you wouldn't have that problem.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:48.580]   I told Lisa we'd bring in some butter so we're going to do that.
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:51.780]   So, yeah, we're going to be imagining how that tastes.
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:55.260]   So what about having an echo on the table there?
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:58.180]   Yeah, they're just asking questions of it.
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:50:59.980]   We did a review of it on before you buy it.
[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:00.980]   No, I mean, I don't mean that.
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:03.260]   I mean, just as a fixture of these, we want to know something.
[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:04.260]   We forgot something.
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:05.820]   Can you ask just to ask echo?
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:07.060]   That's not that good, is it?
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.740]   It's for it depends on what.
[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:11.100]   If first pedestrian things, it's perfect.
[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:14.860]   For any sort of exotic thing that's like, you know, throw out a curveball.
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:16.100]   But again, it's software upgradable.
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:17.420]   Over time, I think it'll be really good.
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.940]   It upgrades itself, right?
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:19.940]   It does.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:20.940]   You don't even know it's over.
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:25.220]   In fact, we noticed an upgrade for it because what we did was...
[01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:30.300]   we set a timer, then we set another timer, and then set another timer, and it'll keep
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:32.660]   all three timers, and then you should say cancel the timer.
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:33.660]   It'll cancel.
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:34.660]   You used to cancel all of them.
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:36.780]   Now it says which timer would you like to cancel?
[01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:38.740]   The 10-minute one, the 15-minute one.
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:42.740]   So like in a period of a couple of weeks after we started ComplaintMayer was listening to
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:45.380]   our complaints, but it upgraded.
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:47.140]   So little by little, they're upgrading it.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:51.620]   But again, the thing that's great about this is not the technology.
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:55.700]   It's the fact that it's an appliance with a high quality microphone and a high quality
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:52:00.740]   speaker that lets you do stuff hands-free, and the psychology of it is what's good about
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:01.740]   it.
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:02.740]   And that's it.
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:03.740]   It's not the technology.
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:04.740]   It's not life-changing.
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:08.060]   It's the psychology of talking to the room and making things happen that's so great.
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:11.380]   And so surprising that Apple and Google didn't do this first.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.420]   Samsung SmartThings sponsor.
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:16.740]   It's also integrated now with Alexa.
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:21.460]   See, now what I'm really interested is talking to my SmartThings stuff.
[01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:24.540]   My son Kevin has it integrated with his lighting system.
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:29.740]   So he walks in and says, "Alexa, turn lights," or all that kind of stuff.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:36.180]   We say Echo here because if you say Alexa, Dr. Mom gets really upset.
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:38.380]   Sorry, Dr. Mom.
[01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:44.140]   I gather, this has been a little bit, I don't know how sensitive this is or not, but SmartThings
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:52.180]   is taking pre-iters for a new hub and I don't know what that means or what's kind of the
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:53.180]   least.
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:54.180]   The second generation one?
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.540]   Should that off its CES, I think?
[01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:57.540]   The thing, okay.
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:58.540]   So it's not a secret.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:52:59.540]   Yeah.
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:00.540]   Okay.
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:04.780]   I don't know what the delay has been though because I mean CES was almost, was what, eight
[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:05.780]   months ago or nine months ago.
[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:08.100]   Well, but they had just been acquired by Samsung.
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:09.100]   Yeah, Samsung.
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:12.900]   So I'm willing to get that's what the, guess that's what the delay was.
[01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:17.740]   So I'm sure they'll send me a hub because they are still a sponsor, but contains Zigbee
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:20.220]   and Z-Wave radios.
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:21.860]   So I think that's really interesting.
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:22.860]   It's the same thing Google.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:26.820]   I think the Google strategy, although Google does not support Z-Wave, which I think is a
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:27.820]   little weird.
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:28.820]   Yeah.
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:29.820]   No, they don't.
[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:30.820]   They have Zigbee and their own stuff.
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:31.820]   Right.
[01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:36.260]   We've, and I'm not even going to get into all the IOT protocols, but there's a couple
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:37.260]   in there, yeah.
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:38.260]   Right.
[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:39.260]   All right.
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:42.460]   Time for our picks of the week before we wrap things up.
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:44.260]   Who wants to start?
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:49.860]   I'll start with you because you're our guest, Ron Amadio.
[01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:54.180]   So my thing is, it's the Android developers backstage podcast.
[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:58.980]   So this is, this is a podcast done by people at Google that work on Android.
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:06.620]   It's, it's usually chat costs and tour, norby who write, you know, all sorts of, of code
[01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:07.620]   for Android.
[01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:11.860]   And they kind of just wander around Google and pick somebody from some sort of Android
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:16.540]   and ask them, you know, what they're, what they're building and kind of go over stuff.
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:20.900]   And it's, it's super, super technical and geeky and stuff like that.
[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:24.100]   And you know, they talk about the Android framework and all that.
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:27.820]   But I've got a ton of information from it.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:34.100]   I, I, you know, will source data from it for reviews and like, there was one where they
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:38.860]   talked to somebody from Android Auto and there was just tons of information about there,
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:41.820]   about like how the, how the car to phone protocol.
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:43.500]   Works and all this other stuff.
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:46.540]   So it's a really cool podcast.
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:48.820]   It is at android backstage.blogspot.com.
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:49.820]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:50.820]   Blogspot.
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:54.980]   They're, they're going all in on that Google ecosystem.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:56.340]   What is the future of blogspot?
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:59.020]   I mean, this has just kind of been left to hang.
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:00.020]   What was the sofa network?
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:01.020]   Or, or cut?
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:02.020]   How do you pronounce that?
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:04.020]   Orca's gone.
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:05.020]   Yeah.
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:06.020]   Right.
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:07.020]   It's just going to sit there and rock.
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:08.220]   I feel like Google has so many treasures.
[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:09.220]   Maybe that's the problem.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:10.220]   Feedburner.
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:11.220]   Yeah.
[01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:12.940]   And we all thought was going to go away and every did.
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:14.020]   I think they forgot it was there.
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:15.500]   If they remembered it was there, they were canceled.
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:16.500]   They would have killed it.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:17.500]   Yeah.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:18.500]   Oh, well.
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:19.500]   I like black spot.
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:20.500]   I mean, there seems like there's somewhere you can go with that.
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:21.500]   Yep.
[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:22.500]   But maybe not.
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:26.460]   Let's, why don't you do one and then we'll get your number of the week.
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:27.900]   Why don't you do one first, Mike Elkin?
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:28.900]   Okay.
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:34.260]   So I'm a big hater of Facebook and especially it's design and that's one of the things I
[01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:35.260]   like about it.
[01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:36.260]   So ugly.
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:37.260]   It's so ugly and it feels hater.
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:38.260]   That's strong.
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:39.260]   Yeah.
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:40.260]   That's why I use it.
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:41.420]   No, I think you're not alone.
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:43.700]   I think everybody uses it and everybody hates it.
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:48.620]   So there is a chrome extension that goes a long way toward fixing the design.
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:50.740]   It's called Facebook Flat.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:56.460]   And if you search the chrome store, the web store for Facebook Flat, you'll find it.
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:55:59.740]   And basically what it does is it gives you a toggle to toggle.
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:02.020]   I should have plugged in here, but I'll do it real quick.
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:08.180]   It gives you a toggle to go back and forth between the old and busted looking Facebook
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:12.500]   and the new cleaner, more modern, flat look for Facebook.
[01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:20.940]   It gets rid of some of the extraneous links and details and visual noise and gives you
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:23.660]   something that looks a lot more pleasant and easier to look at.
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:28.260]   By the way, this is not hard or bad to do because it's just really applying new CSS.
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:33.180]   And again, it gives you a switch in the upper left-hand corner that lets you toggle back
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:34.180]   and forth.
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:36.460]   So anytime you want to look at the original thing, you just throw that switch and you're
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:40.700]   going to go back instantly to the ugly design.
[01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:46.060]   But we all have to use Facebook, I think we can all admit.
[01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:48.260]   It's not friendly.
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:52.620]   It's not anything other than the fact that the single place where everybody is.
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:56.540]   And so this helps and I'm enjoying it.
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:57.540]   Nice.
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.940]   Facebook Flat.
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:00.380]   And so I see your--
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:01.380]   Where is it?
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:02.380]   Oh, it's flat.
[01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:03.380]   There it is.
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:04.380]   There's flat.
[01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:05.700]   The switch is the upper left-hand corner.
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:08.740]   If you really craft, you want to compare it.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:10.380]   I was looking for an interface.
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:11.380]   It just does it.
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:13.380]   So what did it flatten?
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:14.380]   It's very difficult.
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:16.180]   So if you go to the upper left corner, there's a switch.
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:18.180]   You can see how it looks.
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.180]   Yeah, right there.
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:20.180]   Boom.
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:21.780]   That's the ugly Facebook.
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:23.980]   That's the ugly Facebook that we have.
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:26.380]   Oh, this, by the way, takes out ads.
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:27.380]   It still looks like--
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:29.380]   Yeah, it takes out ads and it speeds up the performance as well.
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:30.380]   It sure is fast.
[01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:31.380]   Hey, I wonder how--
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:36.820]   It's easy to see how many employees Facebook has and how little Facebook changes the actual
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:37.820]   product.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:38.820]   They still like that blue.
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:41.380]   Let me see if I can find-- see how Jeff Jarvis's stream looks.
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:42.380]   Yeah.
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:45.180]   We're going to flatten your stream on the flat stream.
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:47.780]   I did stop it a while ago.
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:48.780]   Oh.
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:49.780]   Well, never mind.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:50.780]   I didn't have a Ricky Gervais.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:51.780]   Is he--
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:52.780]   It's there, though.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:53.780]   Yeah.
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:54.780]   Nice.
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:55.780]   Does that look better?
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:56.780]   That looks--
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:57.780]   It just looks better.
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:57:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:57:59.780]   Facebook.
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:00.780]   Flat.
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:01.780]   Square video.
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:02.780]   Yeah.
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:03.780]   Well, you know why?
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.780]   So that people won't bitch at you because you're doing--
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:06.780]   Exactly.
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:07.780]   In poor care.
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:08.780]   Exactly.
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:12.780]   This whole time of the widescreen was a temporary aberration life.
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:14.780]   69 is dead.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:16.780]   It's all four by four.
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:17.780]   Dad.
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:19.580]   Dad, we tell you one by one.
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:21.980]   I mostly take square photos these days because who knows?
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:25.180]   You don't know where it's going.
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:28.620]   I think it's time for a number of the week of the week for Mr. Jarvis, Professor
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:29.620]   Stocker Jarvis.
[01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:33.740]   So, um, Business Insider did one of those, uh, basically me and this roundups from Glass
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:36.060]   Store of what people make at Facebook.
[01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:41.140]   And a lot of the short of it is, you know, dozen jobs and they all, uh, at least 10 reviews
[01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:42.140]   per job title.
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:45.020]   One of these pieces is not as high as I would have thought.
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:47.500]   They all are low six-- very, very low six figures.
[01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:49.540]   110, 150, they're abouts.
[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:50.540]   Really?
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:51.540]   Good money.
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:55.100]   It's fine, but I just would have thought there might have been some kind of, like, somewhere
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:56.100]   in Facebook.
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:58.900]   Well, these, uh, these are the folks who fill these out.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:58:59.900]   Yeah.
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:00.900]   Yeah.
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:01.900]   Yeah.
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:04.500]   I feel like that there are people who don't fill it out because they don't even know how
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:05.500]   much they're making.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:08.500]   And this is salary, not bonus, not stock, not everything else.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:09.500]   Yeah.
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:13.300]   So I don't know how the, what makes me wonder is how, how, what is the mix in Silicon Valley
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:17.820]   salaries these days for companies that have stock that's, that's still going up, but,
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:19.700]   you know, more mature than it was.
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:22.220]   Um, you know, I wonder whether that's over its phone.
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:23.220]   It's not to not get, I mean, a hundred thousand--
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:25.220]   Oh, I mean, I believe there's not something in a bit.
[01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:27.020]   It's a good pay, but I don't know.
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:28.980]   For some reason we got the impression it was much higher.
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:29.980]   Exactly.
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:30.980]   Exactly.
[01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:31.980]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:33.940]   So it does kind of bring it back to reality is that these are good jobs.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:34.940]   They're well-paying jobs.
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:35.940]   They're fun jobs.
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:36.940]   They work your hard.
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:38.620]   Uh, and the salaries are good.
[01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:42.940]   Um, but if we had some idea that they were all stratospheric, that everybody in Facebook
[01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:45.060]   makes gazillions of dollars, no, they're still jobs.
[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:47.660]   And it comes with all the fruit loops you can eat.
[01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:48.660]   Yeah.
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:52.380]   Can, can you even buy a house in the, like, San Francisco?
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:53.380]   No.
[01:59:53.380 --> 01:59:55.380]   Not if you make a, you and your wife have to bulk--
[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:56.380]   You can't find a parking space.
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:57.380]   Both make a hundred.
[01:59:57.380 --> 01:59:58.380]   Even then.
[01:59:58.380 --> 01:59:59.380]   Even then, if you had--
[01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:00.380]   A hundred.
[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:04.940]   You know, I've seen, you know, shacks the valley that are going for three, four million dollars,
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:05.940]   right?
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:06.940]   Yeah.
[02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:07.940]   Yep.
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:08.940]   So this--
[02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:09.940]   Um, yeah, so that's kind of surprising.
[02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:11.940]   They must be bonuses that they're not talking about.
[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:12.940]   Oh, there certainly are.
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:13.940]   Certainly are.
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:14.940]   Certainly are.
[02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:15.940]   Certainly are.
[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:16.940]   Yeah, but I'll, I didn't find a very good number.
[02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:17.940]   I was doing my conference with you.
[02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:20.940]   You're better off being a database engineer than you are being a designer, for instance.
[02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:23.940]   A database engineer, 141,000.
[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:25.140]   Not bad.
[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:29.380]   Technical program manager, 146 product manager, 147.
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:32.820]   Software engineer grade five, 157.
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:37.860]   But that's eight to 10 years of experience.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:38.860]   Senior software engineer.
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:39.860]   Now, you know what?
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:42.420]   These are now getting more like what I'd expect, 160.
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:43.420]   Yeah.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:44.420]   Yeah.
[02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:46.380]   Engineering manager, 166.
[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:50.460]   You might be able to rent a room in a ranch style house in gamble.
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:52.780]   That's exactly what it says.
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:54.340]   Where does that go?
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:57.340]   I don't know why the housing costs are so high.
[02:00:57.340 --> 02:00:58.340]   Yeah.
[02:00:58.340 --> 02:00:59.340]   Oh, man.
[02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:03.180]   All right, I have a number of different things I can pick, but I think I'm going to show
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:04.180]   this one.
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:06.460]   This is called UBlock Origin.
[02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:10.860]   And I found out about it yesterday on Security Now, and Steve Gibson is going to do an entire
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:12.460]   show on it next week.
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:14.180]   We've talked about ad blockers.
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:16.700]   We've talked about plug-in blockers.
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:20.420]   This one is the simplest, cleanest I've ever seen.
[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:23.260]   It has a big, it's a Chrome extension.
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:30.220]   And it came from an email we got where the guy said, "Instead of Chrome OS and all this,
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:32.580]   when I have my clients, they need to be safe.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:33.580]   It's really simple.
[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:38.260]   Macintosh, running Google Chrome, running UBlock Origin.
[02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:43.460]   That big on/off switch will change how, let's go to a, what's a site that's just really
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:48.260]   loaded with commercials and how about the Verge here?
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:49.740]   Now I've got UBlock Origin.
[02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:55.060]   Let's turn off UBlock Origin and refresh this page just to see what it looks like.
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:57.780]   Maybe the Verge isn't as good an example as it used to be.
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:01:58.780]   This isn't too bad.
[02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:00.540]   There's a front page isn't too bad.
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:01.540]   Where's it?
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:03.900]   I hate to pick out any of our friends.
[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:07.700]   Lately, I haven't been able to use Android Central on my mobile because it's just got
[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:09.700]   so much, but this doesn't look that bad.
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:12.700]   But you turn it on and it just blocks.
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:13.860]   Oh, it's on.
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:14.900]   That's why.
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:15.900]   It blocks.
[02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:20.100]   How many requests have been blocked to third-party sites?
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:21.100]   Domains are connected.
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:30.060]   It has a very advanced mode, not recommended, but it's pretty impressive and very simple.
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:34.660]   Boy, I tell you, when it's on and I've been using it for a couple of days and I haven't
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:40.460]   even really noticed, when it's on, it speeds up the load of pages like, "No, nobody's
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:41.460]   business."
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:46.700]   By the way, I don't know if it's Facebook flat or you block origin with those blocking
[02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:47.900]   those ads on Facebook.
[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:49.220]   It might well have been.
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:56.020]   Now ad blocking is controversial because as Renee Ritchie has pointed out at iMour.com,
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:00.140]   that's what pays for all this great content we get from this site.
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:03.620]   On the other hand, as others have pointed out, you may have 100 megabytes with downloads
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:10.260]   from a front page that takes several minutes.
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:18.020]   We'll have more on Tuesday on security now, but boy, this was a simple and fast install.
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:22.100]   I'm not encouraging people to add blocking by any means because it blocks our ads.
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:23.660]   Thank you for that.
[02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:24.980]   I know how you feel about it.
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:27.820]   Me too.
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:30.780]   Unfortunately, it's not merely that ads are annoying.
[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:38.140]   There's a security impact with a lot of these ads now and a big performance hit.
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:40.220]   We got to do more Google contributor style stuff.
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:45.820]   We got to find ways to make journalism pay because I don't want to block ads.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:51.140]   But I have to admit, Jeff, and you probably agree, how often do we click on those ads?
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:54.140]   Are those ads really worth anything anyway?
[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:55.140]   Right?
[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:57.940]   That's I think we have to reinvent advertising this different thing.
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:03:59.420]   But in the meantime, this is all we're making money.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:01.700]   This is all we're going to support media.
[02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:02.700]   Yeah.
[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:03.700]   I've had this.
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:10.300]   Steve and I go back and forth on this because, yeah, and I've never blocked ads before, but
[02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:11.900]   I have to say it.
[02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:15.140]   It does speak things up a lot.
[02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:16.140]   Wow.
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:24.380]   Anyway, in the past, I recommended Privacy Badger, another great tool from the EFF.
[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:25.380]   This one's interesting.
[02:04:25.380 --> 02:04:26.380]   You block Origin.
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:27.900]   We'll do a whole a bit on it.
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:36.380]   I think the debate has to continue about how we support online sites without having them
[02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:38.460]   way us down.
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.540]   I'm the biggest fan of advertising.
[02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:48.700]   Yeah, because you say it's ethically superior form of monetization because it's democratizing.
[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:53.900]   It basically makes things free for people who couldn't pay a subscription or whatever.
[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:54.940]   So I like it for that reason.
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:05:00.540]   But the real thing is these companies need to deliver on the promise of contextual advertising.
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:03.020]   They harvest all the data and but doing it for a long time.
[02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:06.500]   Everybody complains about the data harvesting, but nobody complains about the fact that we
[02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:08.300]   don't get much for it.
[02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.020]   The ads aren't particularly contextual.
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:12.700]   They're not particularly relevant or specific to our needs.
[02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:13.700]   And they're annoying, isn't it?
[02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:15.180]   That's the solution.
[02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:20.540]   If the advertisement was so dead on about what you want and giving you what you want,
[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:21.540]   everybody would love it.
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.060]   But that's not the case.
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:28.500]   So I mentioned this as a public service to many of our viewers who do block ads.
[02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:34.220]   We do have that conversation regularly on this show and others about the consequences
[02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:35.380]   of doing that.
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:40.020]   But I realize I'm a hypocrite because I skip ads and the Tivo all the time.
[02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:43.740]   I think just flash blocking is a good compromise.
[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:50.380]   It's a good start where you get rid of this super crazy, heavy advertisements and just
[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:54.180]   kind of do the tech stuff or the pictures or whatever.
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:56.700]   And the flash is a huge security issue.
[02:05:56.700 --> 02:05:57.700]   Yeah.
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:05:59.820]   You know, all of this page are salaries.
[02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:04.700]   We've been through this before though, remember, when X10 and others were doing pop-unders and
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:09.180]   pop-ups and the browsers built in pop-up blockers.
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:13.820]   And because that was so annoying, they were, you know, and you could make the same argument
[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:20.900]   but those X10 ads are paying for, you know, Windows magazine or whatever.
[02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:22.540]   But they were so annoying.
[02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:25.500]   Should Twit lead a boycott of flash?
[02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:27.980]   Just get everybody to stop using to disable it.
[02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:28.980]   We use it.
[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:31.420]   After we stop using it.
[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:36.220]   I cannot use it because our providers use stream and bit gravity.
[02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:37.780]   Their stream providers are in flash.
[02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:40.380]   But they've got to be preparing to move beyond.
[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:45.940]   Well, there, in fact, if you go to our Twit.tv/live on an Android phone, which has no flash,
[02:06:45.940 --> 02:06:48.540]   it'll still be used stream but it'll be an HLS stream from the stream.
[02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:50.140]   So they're capable of doing it.
[02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:51.940]   I don't know why they don't.
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:53.420]   It's like old yellow, you know.
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:56.140]   At some point you've got to go out there.
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:57.140]   Old yellow.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:59.540]   Alright, somebody says go to brake.com.
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:00.540]   That'll break your machine.
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:01.540]   There you go.
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:03.100]   That's a good cipher.
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:05.020]   I wonder how fast, okay, let's see.
[02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:09.820]   I've never looked how fast that loaded with UBlock Origin off.
[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:12.820]   Now let's reload it.
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:14.660]   Now let's still blocking.
[02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:15.660]   Oh no, there they are.
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:16.660]   Here they come.
[02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:21.220]   They're slowly arriving, fitting up the page.
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:24.620]   Oh look, I'm on it.
[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:25.620]   Wow.
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:28.020]   Yeah, your video's gone viral.
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:29.020]   Alright.
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:34.820]   Maybe I'll make some money on advertising.
[02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:38.980]   I'm on brake.com right next to the woman who sued the porn company after accidentally
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:40.860]   performing with her own brother.
[02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:41.860]   Yeah.
[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:44.380]   Aren't you proud?
[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:46.180]   I'm proud.
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:47.180]   Wow.
[02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:51.060]   Alright, let's take a break and end this silliness.
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:53.020]   Ron Amadio, always great to have you on.
[02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:54.020]   Thank you so much.
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:55.020]   Anytime.
[02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:56.020]   I really appreciate it.
[02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:57.820]   Great to have you here, Ron.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:01.940]   Ron's at R's Technica and he's on the Twitter @Ronamadio.
[02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:04.020]   Easy to remember.
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:08.500]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:15.540]   CUNY is also blogger at buzzmachine.com and the author of some fabulous reading material.
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:17.300]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, plug time.
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:18.300]   Audible.
[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:19.300]   Audible.
[02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:20.300]   Audible.
[02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:22.220]   Keep experiencing gifts is out as an audio book.
[02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:23.860]   You can hear my dulcet tones.
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:25.500]   You don't hear enough of me here.
[02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:26.500]   You can hear even more of me.
[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:27.500]   I saw that.
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:28.500]   I was so excited for you.
[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:29.500]   And you read it.
[02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:30.500]   I read it.
[02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:31.500]   I read it.
[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:32.500]   It can't be very long.
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:33.500]   No, it's not.
[02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:37.500]   I don't know how long it is, but it's not very long.
[02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:38.500]   And then a half.
[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:41.180]   It's hard work.
[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:42.180]   It is.
[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:43.180]   It took a day and a half to do it.
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:44.180]   Yeah.
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:45.180]   How many retakes?
[02:08:45.180 --> 02:08:49.660]   Well, the way they do it, and they say, "The first two books is they would have me read
[02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:53.140]   and I screw up and I would do that regularly and then I would just do it again."
[02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:55.500]   And some poor schmuck editor had to do the whole thing.
[02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:56.500]   Oh, God.
[02:08:56.500 --> 02:09:00.500]   And Audible, they back up to three words before and then you just pick up when...
[02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:01.500]   Oh, really?
[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:02.500]   ...it's come back.
[02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:03.500]   Oh, nice.
[02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:04.500]   So they have me do...
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:05.500]   I did five errors.
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:06.500]   So they have me come back to do five.
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:09.500]   And then they put shit in, as they say.
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:12.500]   If I ever record a book, I'm going to do it live.
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.500]   Let's do it live.
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:14.500]   Not to tape a search of pain.
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:15.500]   It's so hard to do.
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:19.100]   He's sparing gifts, five hours and 50 minutes of goodness with Jeff Jarvis.
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:20.500]   You know, you want to hear that in his voice.
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:21.500]   Yeah.
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:22.500]   You really do.
[02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:26.500]   Mike Elgin is our News Director and the host of Geekspering News.
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:28.500]   Yes, Geeksfang News.
[02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:29.500]   That's us.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:30.500]   Take news today.

[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:36.500]   UTC.
[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:42.500]   I'll get it right one of these days at twit.tv.
[02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:43.500]   Yes.
[02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:45.500]   And you'll catch her making cheese and butter.
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:46.500]   Cheese and butter.
[02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:47.500]   Yes.
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:48.500]   Awesome.
[02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:49.500]   It's awesome.
[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:50.500]   I'm telling you.
[02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:53.500]   I never understand why Mike is so slender, thin, good-looking.
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:56.500]   And he eats like a pig.
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:59.500]   You know, one of those statements is true.
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:02.500]   But you know, we do...
[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:04.500]   But Amir feeds you healthy food.
[02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:05.500]   Yes, it's healthy.
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:06.500]   That's exactly it.
[02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:07.500]   It's quality of food.
[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:08.500]   This is part and time.
[02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:09.500]   It's amazing.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:11.500]   And we just today, in fact, we bought a cheese cave.
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:12.500]   It's a...
[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:13.500]   It's like a refrigerator that's...
[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:15.500]   It maintains about 50 degrees.
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:17.500]   And so we're really excited about it.
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:19.500]   We're going to be making blue cheese and like camembert and...
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:20.500]   Oh, that sounds awesome.
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:22.500]   How long does it take to make a blue?
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.500]   Oh, I think it's a couple months, three months.
[02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:25.500]   Something like that.
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:26.500]   Gouda, yeah.
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:27.500]   It's gouda.
[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:28.500]   Yeah.
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:29.500]   Baby gouda.
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:30.500]   Gouda baby.
[02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:35.500]   I'm so excited.
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:38.500]   Gary Vaynerchuk's family's wine store, the wine library in New Jersey, which is a great
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:39.500]   store.
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:41.500]   And I always go off and they have lots of cheese samples.
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:42.500]   Yeah.
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:46.500]   And I'm just a gog about all the different flavors that can come out of another one.
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:47.500]   Yeah, this is so good.
[02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:48.500]   It's the greatest thing ever.
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.500]   I don't think it comes out of the other that way, but...
[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:51.500]   Well, if only...
[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:53.500]   Well, GMO cows may be someday.
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:54.500]   Mmm.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:55.500]   You know, I want the chocolate.
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:56.500]   Yeah, they get milk cheese.
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:57.500]   Mmm.
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:58.500]   Cheese.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:59.500]   It would hurt.
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:00.500]   Cheese.
[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:01.500]   Thank you all.
[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:02.500]   What a great show.
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:03.500]   I love doing it.
[02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:04.500]   I look for...
[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:06.500]   These are my last show of the week and I look forward to it all week because I take Thursday
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:07.500]   and Friday off.
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:08.500]   But we'll be back.
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:10.500]   Don't forget every Wednesday.
[02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:13.500]   About 1.30 pm Pacific, 4.30 Eastern time, 20th year.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:14.500]   What about this?
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:15.500]   Thereabouts.
[02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:16.500]   This.
