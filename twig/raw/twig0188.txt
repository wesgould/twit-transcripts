[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   It's time for Twig this week in Google and we've got a great show planned for you Jeff and Gina are here
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.280]   Along with Aaron Nukem. We're gonna talk about trolls. What's going on? Who are they and what makes somebody turn into a troll?
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.560]   We'll also talk about some new Google of features is a big long change log and a rap video all about Google that made Gina cry
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.560]   It's all coming up next on twig
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.320]   Netcasts you love from people you trust

[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.480]   All of that jazz with Gina's repani of smarter where dot org and host of all about Android hi Gina
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.040]   Hello. Good to see you sweater. Thank you. It's sweater day. It is sweater day
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.040]   [laughter]
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   Gina also a former founding editor of a life hacker and just a
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.200]   All-around great person to have a developer so we get the developers perspective on that speaking of developers Aaron Nukem is joining us
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.400]   Yes, thanks for having me. He's a Linux geek works at oracle. Are you developer at Oracle or a project product manager? No, we have product manager. Yeah. Yep
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.040]   But I do development on this one. That's what happens when you don't develop for a while. You make your product. That's right. That's right
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.400]   Sorry, I didn't get them. I didn't wear my sweater. I wore my uh, okay. What's your t-shirt? Uh t-shirt is an android. I like it
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.680]   I like it. That's that android that you see on the phone when you're getting updated, but it's taken apart so you can explode it
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.040]   That's right. That's right. You see see all the parts all the pieces all the guts
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.760]   Speaking of guts. Here's the man
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.000]   Spills his guts on the internet Jeff Jarvis that I do
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.240]   I'll do public parts and uh
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   Professor of journalism at the city university of New York by the blogger at buzz machine dot
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.080]   com
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.920]   Yeah, and if you all hadn't watched the pre-show you should really watch live because more information than you ever wanted to have
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.240]   About everyone's grooming habits
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.240]   Grooming earwax everything
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.640]   Yeah, we're here
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.560]   We went there. We're living in public here
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.040]   The reason we got into earwax is because you know I wear any of your monitors like like bono does
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.560]   These are wearing ultimate ears
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.440]   But they've kind of fallen apart over the years because I use them so heavily
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.920]   Um on the shows, you know, it's funny because when I'm in I don't know why but it's just that it's the
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.680]   Aesthetic of it when I'm in my office doing the radio show. I wear these big
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.160]   Headphones I look like a radio guy, but when for some reason when we come out here
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.560]   I go to the in ear monitor. I could wear wear either in both situations
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.560]   But I just for some reason this is more like tv. So I don't want to have big headphones on
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.200]   Um, so I wear the bono in ear monitors
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   But uh, so the guy who started ultimate ears sold it to logitech so they own it now
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.280]   That made me a little nervous
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.080]   And he started a new one called jh audio so I ordered a pair
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.120]   But you know the problem with all of these is they're they're they're they're fit to your ear
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.640]   So you have to go get to an audiologist and they make molds of your ears and then you send them to the company and then they
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.640]   Make uh headphones and then and all of that and it's very probably
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.280]   Hey leo that'll probably get rid of the lock. Well, that's what happened. I went to the audiologist. She said, oh no
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.120]   I'm not going in there
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.880]   The backstory was even more interesting than the fact
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:24.840]   I'm not going well and and here's the side thing on that 23 and me which is uh, and we'll just what's it?
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.320]   How do you pronounce it last time? Well, jickey jickey, uh, leery page is a wife's
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.520]   Uh and who used to work at google now has a company called 23 and me which you send them a cheek swab
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.680]   Mm-hmm
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.280]   And then they uh give you a genetic analysis. You actually send them
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.240]   I happen to have one because i'm
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.320]   I've done it, but i'm doing an augmented they wanted more so you get this little kit where you um more saliva
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.040]   Spit and that's right. You spit. That's right. That's right. It's bit spit until you think you can spit no more
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   Um and then you send this off for this little box. It's only a hundred bucks now, which is nice. Yeah
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.760]   It's it's it's something so
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.520]   So, um, I didn't really learn I thought I'd learn more. I mean, I didn't really learn much, you know
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.120]   I learned i'm from europe. Yeah, and as a european male you have an elevated risk of but as of a heart attack of
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.240]   Diabetes, you know all this but it's because you're a european male not anything in particular about you
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.960]   Your disease risk is all based on your ethnic roots apparently
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.000]   But I did learn there is there are a few traits that they can tell you and one is I have wet earwax
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.880]   You see you see yeah
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.560]   Is that important?
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.560]   I didn't know yeah, like what's important
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.680]   Is it even brown eyes and wet earwax? Yeah
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.680]   So my risk of prostate cancer is 43.4
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.360]   Percent compared to the average 17.8, but that's just because i'm a man
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.920]   Yeah, um, so so you're going to do another one that tells you more about yourself
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.600]   It uh, there was a certain thing that it said and the results that you need to get more on this
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.640]   Result which is one I kind of want to know about um
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   You need to do another one. Oh, so this is like digging deeper
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.720]   Interesting so I remember why did it so long ago. I got I got it free
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:19.720]   What an appeared at pardon me Davos about four years ago my uh, I do not flush due to alcohol
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.640]   I have i'm unlikely to taste bitter foods. Does it have the asparagus thing in there?
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.120]   Really because is that genetic? I don't know i'm likely tolerant of lactose my have my hair is slightly
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.800]   Curlier than average my eyes are likely to be brown. Well good. I I spent a hundred dollars to learn that
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.200]   My muscle performance. I'm a likely sprinter wrong
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.720]   I am not a likely sprinter
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:53.160]   Anyway, you know retro virus. I'm not resistant to a norovirus. I'm not resistant to AIDS
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.920]   Uh, if i'm a smoker i'm likely to smoke more than the average bear
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.440]   And I think this is oh here it is asparagus metabolite detection
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.320]   Higher odds of detecting
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.400]   What what what what does I mean your p smells even worse than it's a 23 and we
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.200]   Discovery some do
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   And it's a discovery based on the
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.040]   So that's the interesting thing about this then you ask a lot they ask you a lot of questions. Oh, and then they do some
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.240]   um
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.920]   Geno typing with your phenotype to match it up. And that's one of the things
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.280]   Apparently I have a mild moderately higher odds of smelling asparagus in my urine
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.160]   It is what it is really I was just joking
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.480]   No, it's that's what it is
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.560]   But you know what it there's only three choices
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:51.080]   Uh typical odds moderately higher odds or substantially higher odds. So basically there's no nobody who doesn't
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.960]   have odds
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   Or something right
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.720]   It's a very good mine up. Hmm. Yeah. No one let me see that's in here too
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.440]   But that's all right enough enough genetic. I do think this is interesting
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.480]   But it's such early days that it doesn't really tell you a whole lot yet
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.120]   It doesn't it doesn't it doesn't no
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.720]   Ester Dyson is 110 people who published her full genome. Well, I tried to do that now. That's another project
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.600]   And I applied for it. I haven't heard back
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.120]   That's the public genome project, which is a very interesting project. We the reason I did is we interviewed
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.760]   the guy on futures and biotech
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.200]   Who's uh doing this and the idea is
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.160]   You have to you apply and they have to accept you and they do a full genotype like not just
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.720]   It's a personal genome project. I should say
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.960]   Not just the 23 and me, which is a few genotypes. They do the full and it's which is much more expensive still
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.400]   and
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.600]   if you
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   Participate you agree
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.640]   First of all to fill out a big phenotype questionnaire every your complete medical history. This is what ester's done
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.520]   And that it will be published because they say we can't guarantee privacy and and
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:08.680]   Really the point of this is to match your phenotype with your genotype so that there can be research done
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.560]   So I said I will do this because I you know, I don't I don't have anything to hide. I live in public
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.800]   Like you do you do jeff and
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.880]   Somebody pointed out you should ask your kids because you are in fact giving out information about your
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.680]   When I talked to ester about this when I was researching public parts
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.040]   I I talked to her and said well, you know, I guess ester I am revealing my son's
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.640]   um
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.120]   DNA about prostate cancer and she said oh jeff everybody gets prostate cancer get over it
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.800]   It's true all men eventually if you live long enough chances are very high
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.120]   So they don't have a whole lot. I don't uh right now there's a
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.720]   10
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.360]   Or something participants esters one of the one of them
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.920]   But they said there's no way that we can hide
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.680]   Your your your name and information so we don't even try
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.640]   So they rejected you again because why they reject me. I just I've applied I've said i'll pay the money
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.320]   Uh because I really want to do it, but I haven't heard anything back from yet
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.600]   So, but that was that was more than a year ago. It was futures in biotech. Yeah, so I don't know if they're stalled or
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.240]   Maybe they've got so many
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.160]   Submissions that's possible. Yeah, and but it is one of those things where you kind of want to think
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.720]   Along and harder before you do this because it'll say you know leo loport is
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.160]   You know has carries some gene that makes it very likely that he's going to have alzheimer's in three years
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.680]   That's exactly the fear and and and do you want to know it's like well
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.080]   Somebody women are going through this now with the breast cancer gene
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:36.200]   Not only not only do you want to know, but do you want your insurance company to know?
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.640]   That's that's where we need legislation to protect you right?
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.560]   Um, but I just think this is so this is and kudos to ester and everybody who's done this
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.960]   It's a huge contribution because
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.440]   The problem is you know now you can order their genotype, you know, it's in a bottle
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:00.920]   It's like halo, right? You can order their genotype and it's you know, it's it's ester and uh, and you then can look at the
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.120]   phenotype like what her family histories are what her
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   Medical history isn't everything and you could start doing some research around this stuff
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   And so I think this is a brilliant thing. It's person if you want to know more personal genomes.org
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.720]   and um, I have high hopes for this
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.440]   But uh, I think you crash the 23 ame server. I can't get to my stuff. Oh really? Right?
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.120]   Um, two three amd me.com for now
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.840]   All right. So venous thromboism. I've got a two and a half higher
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.120]   Risk lung cancer or 1.4
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.080]   I remember one more four times higher risk course. It helps that I smoked for eight years
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.160]   Um
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.880]   Back in a generation is high diabetes very high
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.640]   But the thing that they're learning is that merely the genotype is not enough that they many people carry genotypes
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.760]   But the expression of the gene has a lot to do with environmental and other
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.720]   Uh, other nurture causes, right? Not not nature causes
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.040]   So you can have what all it's telling you is you have this higher likelihood
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.000]   But if you don't encounter the environmental stimuli to trigger it you won't get it
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.240]   And and there is still very early days. That's a thing that's things kind of maddening about 23 ame is that it says well
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.920]   There's this likelihood. It doesn't mean you're actually gonna get it's not a diagnosis of anything. They can't that's why this likelihood
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.560]   Isn't that right? They can of course the limitation. I think of genomics. I think we had hoped for more right
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.720]   Maybe there will be more down the road. Maybe there will be yeah, um
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:35.320]   I just think this you know and and what what i'll give you one example of the value of this every cancer is genetically unique
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:43.480]   And uh, if we could genotype the cancers and genotype the patient we could create a cancer
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:51.400]   Fighting agent that targets just those cells and chemo would be not nearly so dramatically poisonous
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.400]   In fact would be much more likely to be
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:13:00.280]   Successful and I think this is gonna happen the next decade. Mm-hmm. These kinds of tailored drugs
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.760]   Um
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.400]   Silver bullet drugs. I think these are this is more likely but you know you should do listen to futures in biotech
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.320]   We no longer broadcast the show, but he's still doing it if you do. Uh, I think twice a month
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.840]   Uh, mark pellet she does futures in biotech futures in biotech
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:21.240]   Dot com I think but you could google futures in biotech every Tuesday every other Tuesday. He does it
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:28.520]   Uh, let's get to google effect lots of google stuff. This would be a good time to do the google
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.320]   changelog
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.560]   the google changelog
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, Gina trapani with the google changelog. I just love that bumper
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.080]   lots
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:52.280]   Lots of mobile app changes this week. Uh, google maps for iOS got updated with google contact support and local search categories
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.160]   So contact support means that it brings in your home address and other addresses from your google contacts on the web
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.440]   Once you sign in, this is the new google maps for iOS
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.280]   Um new version the app also allows for quicker local search. You can choose
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.120]   uh
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:13.560]   Places from categories like restaurants and stores and this new version also lets you pick between kilometers and miles as your distance units
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.320]   Uh, the google chrome beta for android
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:24.680]   Also, this is uh, this is the chrome 26 beta on android is adding password sync across devices
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.000]   So this will be enabled over the coming days
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.520]   It only syncs with other clients that are also based on chrome 26 or higher
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.440]   So that that's really nice and that and it's actually going to sync your autofill
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.840]   values as well
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.520]   The other thing the chrome beta for android adds is uh, the the option to use data compression
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.640]   When google says will speed up your web browsing by 50
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:54.040]   Uh, so to turn this on this is in the chrome beta for android if you go in the omnibox you type in chrome
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.240]   Uh colon slash laughs flags and then you have to enable the first setting
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:04.120]   This is an experimental feature. So you enable that first setting there, which is enable data compression proxy
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.360]   So so basically google's put out a bunch of proxy servers running speedy
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.080]   Which is their new compression protocol and so anytime you browse to a website not ssl
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:19.800]   But are just a normal correction website you will go through google's really super fast proxy servers and reduce your data usage
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.840]   And uh, so like I said google said this accelerator will reduce data usage by 50
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.040]   And uh, but you can see for yourself how much it actually saves you in that same chrome version
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.240]   If you go to chrome a colon slash s net internals, you can go to the bandwidth section
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:42.760]   And it'll tell you actually how much bandwidth you save using this pd proxy. Yes. Uh, uh, it's not the first on my list
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.840]   What's it called so I can look for it?
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.160]   uh, the um the flag
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.000]   Check check your beta the uh, the data compression proxy. It's called enable data compression proxy
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.080]   Uh, it would make sense. Thank you. Yeah, and it's in the new it's in the new beta
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.000]   I'm actually not sure if it's if it's rolled out quite yet. It's chrome 26
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.840]   Uh, 0.0 0.14 10 0.26
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:10.920]   And it says uh, it's it's rolling out over the next few days. You have to be using the chrome beta app. I believe
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:17.240]   Yeah, yeah, I am doing now. There's as I learned last week. There's the developer track and the beta track, right?
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.640]   Which is in the developer or the beta?
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:27.000]   No, beta is in the chrome beta. Yep. Yep. Uh, for those of you running the stable version of chrome on android and even ios
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.920]   Uh, those have both gotten updated to also get faster speed up
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.000]   Um, latest version of chrome on android
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   You can scroll and fling to view all of your favorite web pages with more speed and ease. Google says scroll and flings
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.400]   Scroll and fling
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.880]   Uh, it's got the latest version the vh javascript engine
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:49.320]   It's which is optimized now for mobile and google says they've improved the octane performance benchmark
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.320]   by 25 on average
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.800]   So faster chrome across the board whether or not you're using beta or stable
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.080]   And uh on ios chrome also got an update if you're using chrome on your iphone or your ipad
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.960]   Searching with google got easier. You can see search here. You can see your search term in the omnibox
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.400]   So instead of the long url which will get cut off on your phone, especially
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.640]   You'll just see your search terms in the in the omnibox
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.920]   And um a couple other new ios features
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.000]   To quickly view your tab history if you press and hold the back button
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.880]   To see any page that you previously visited then a drop down appears and you can and you can quickly
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.960]   Tap on one
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:32.520]   The menu you can share a web page that you visited and you can share any web page via messages as well and that's not that's on ios
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.600]   Uh, that's it for that's it for chrome on on mobile
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.680]   Much far from it about the change log
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.120]   There's a couple of things
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.560]   Google plus uh totally revamp the your profile pages today. Have you guys seen this?
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.800]   Yeah, really nice cover photo is enormous resolution up to
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.240]   21 20 by 1192 pixels
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:03.480]   And just nicer about layout and and it's really much easier to see how other people can see how public people can see your profile
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.600]   How your friends see it what it looks like to you obviously
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.760]   Um, there's a sticky basic information bar as you scroll down the page
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:17.320]   Uh, just really nice and and and with that cover photo upgrade the hover cards and you hover over other users names
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.120]   You can see their cover photo on the hover card looks really really nice
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:26.840]   And uh, well, well, I might as well add this here in the in the in the change log and probably we have it listed elsewhere
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.400]   But the the play stores one year uh birthday is this week
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.720]   And they're doing a little promotion over at the play store a bunch of stuff for free
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:41.000]   So if you go to if you go to google play the the play store you can click on there celebrate our first birthday with limited time gifts
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.640]   Free songs a couple of free apps a couple of nice nice giveaways this year to
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.600]   To celebrate their their year old. I guess the market was around. I guess they renamed it the place
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.480]   Year ago exactly and I'm you know, it's funny at the time. I thought man, that's such a great name
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.520]   But now I love it. So grew on me and finally, uh google i.o
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.120]   Which is going on in uh in may their new the new
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:10.360]   I owe 2013 site is up if you go to developers.google.com slash events slash i.o
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.240]   All brands everybody knows one divided by zero to the thirteenth
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.800]   Is one
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:23.240]   What's zero to the thirteenth is it one? No, it's a division by zero. It's division by zero. Is it zero to the thirteenth zero?
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.600]   Yeah, well, that's not good. No, I just realized I can write binary down here at the bottom. Squooch it
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.200]   Squooch it
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.920]   Oh, you're writing binary. Oh cool. If you get the code right it will unlock google
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.640]   And and you'll get the google achievement
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.720]   It's binary. What what are you writing? I don't know? It's gotta happen. I'm telling you a certain number
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.120]   Try doing 13 in binary. What is that?
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.680]   Someone give me the zero zero one zero
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:57.880]   General will tell us yeah, it's never will tell us one zero one one one zero one one okay?
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:05.160]   Oh, or is it one one zero one one one zero one one zero one try that
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.680]   Yeah, nothing ever
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.520]   It's gotta do something you crashed googles. Yeah
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   If you click on it different
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.080]   Sequences they sometimes turn red
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.280]   Yeah, so it looks like if you get it wrong it turns red and then the next one that you click it will start the next
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:29.240]   Sequence so you're going for something. There's something going on there chadam saying zero and then one one one one one one
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.680]   I don't know why
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.920]   Uh, well here. I also see zero zero one one one two three
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   No, I think it try zero and five ones six ones zero one
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   two three four five six
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:52.200]   You guys there's no there's no way to confirm or you're saying doesn't I mean
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.640]   This weekend paint drying
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:04.680]   It's asking
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:11.720]   So it was up here all one zero in all ones and it's actually up here in the corner of the
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.440]   webpage so that it looks like I have
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.480]   Pass through the first gate
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.800]   Now you gotta do it again
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   Again, okay. Here we go. You've entered the major
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.240]   It's now asky, right
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:31.720]   Wait a minute. Where is this so this is uh, it's the link. It's the google, uh, IO page
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:38.040]   Google.com slash events slash IO. Yeah, this is just the IO 2013 kind of official site
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.160]   It just went up to it just went up this week. Thanks to bear in the chat room for letting us know
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.640]   Are you spelling a word perhaps? I don't know
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:51.640]   What is that first? What is the first? I want free IO tickets. What is the zero plus five ones in asky? I mean in uh binary
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.400]   It is a binary
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.960]   It is binary. No, but what is that equivalent to?
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.080]   Then let me find out um
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.640]   binary translators
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.880]   Everyone get out there by
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.360]   That would mean asky hello world
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:15.880]   It also makes great sound effects on both the asky version and the oh does it I miss that I I had it muted
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.280]   This is good. This is fun. Oh now it's that's eight bit now
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.600]   So here you're gonna you're an asky I'm in the eight bit so oh
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.120]   I I I I I I I I
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:33.400]   Yeah, that sounds like castle wolfenstein. All right. Yeah
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.600]   So
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:45.080]   No, wow, that is so fun. Meanwhile, I can't save my cover photo try again later. Oh, no
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.520]   Yeah, I don't know so you have to upgrade by hand
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.400]   Uh, yeah, it kind of prompts you when you go to your profile like hey get a new cover photo
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:59.400]   Yeah, and it says there's no going back. So just yeah, there's no going back. Oh going back once you change
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.880]   Your life will change forever
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.440]   Lauren one stone is complaining that I want to read the posts. I don't want to see the gigantic photo
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.320]   No, I think that's that makes it more appealing. Doesn't it?
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.480]   They've been going way more visual. I think it's just because it's been used for you know
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.440]   Google+ has had this great photography community. Yeah
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.320]   So just a round of the things. Yes, sorry
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:27.160]   Look what I got. Oh, he's got bacon and eggs now bacon and eggs. How did you do that? What it's one zero zero
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.520]   One zero zero zero zero
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:36.040]   I don't know go to my cover. I just put a one and two zeros and then one and four zeros
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.960]   Giant
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:44.040]   You're right. That is a little big for a profile photo. Holy moly when you navigate to someone's profile
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.160]   It starts the page kind of like halfway down the photo. Okay, you know, so you have to scroll up. Have you done yours?
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.600]   Should I go to your I have yeah, go right ahead. Let's go to jina's
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:58.120]   See what happens. Oh, not somebody else, but that's nice. That's pretty. That's making peters
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.360]   I don't know who that is, but that's nice. Okay
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.280]   All right. All right. Cool. I got another one
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.560]   Nice cats
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:15.400]   Okay, okay, okay, okay
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:21.480]   So this is some so the game is if you note when it goes red you got it
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.680]   You got to learn basically not to do that sequence
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:29.880]   Yeah, I don't think it's binary anymore because it it seems like it's more of a
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.400]   It seems like it's more of just a pattern
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.360]   Um, that's weird and it's not the same on each stage. Oh, oh
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.640]   Someone is totally right now. I got them. I got them. I love that stuff. That's cool. Oh
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:50.360]   Oh, so you get a different one of the sequence each thing that you do. Oh a synthesizer. You got a mogue
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.800]   Nice
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.600]   This is somebody's 20% project absolutely years
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.200]   Hold her. I don't know if I'm happy about this
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:06.600]   No, you want to you know, I guess this is all HTML5. This is all just to attract attract the developers
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.840]   All just to show how much we can do an HTML5 exactly right
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.640]   And what's sad is at this site? I mean is really
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.400]   Registration is on march 13th starting at 7 a.m
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   Pacific time so kind of we've got basically a week to kind of play around it. It fills up pretty quick, right? So
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:29.800]   Yeah, like within 20 minutes last year. So I'm not sure probably quicker this year just to speed up the
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.440]   What what will they be giving away? They'll be giving away a pixel. What do you think?
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.720]   Pixel and nexus five
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.280]   What what are we gonna get?
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.440]   What comes after you way things they don't have yet the next they don't announce things there
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.360]   So I don't think the nexus five so it would be a four then probably yeah, right?
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:54.200]   They don't announce the queue. Yeah, they announced the queue. That's true. They announced glad. Well, that works so well
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:03.240]   Good theory Jeff. So they don't announce any successful products. Oh, I just lost pong. Oh, you were playing pong? Yeah
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:13.000]   It has pong it has pong yeah one and six zeros and then another one. You know, you gotta think how much productivity is lost to google doodles over years
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.680]   It's a conspiracy they announced the nexus seven last year and gave it to people so no I think this
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.920]   I mean this is a great way to make the developer conference of a high
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.520]   Priority for people's is because they know they're gonna get a bunch of crap
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:32.200]   New version of android maybe Chad's coming out long we've lost him
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:39.320]   There's always a new version of android, you know, right right so it's fortitude too is the current version, right?
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.440]   Uh, are we gonna go to kit? Oh, sorry and I was saying crawl. I meant chrome. I'm sorry
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:49.560]   I'm sure dandroid and thought chrome. I was like there's always a new version of chrome. I know yeah, either android or the
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.960]   Motorola nexus
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   Um, which has been rumored. I mean, I don't know
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.680]   Xbone probably
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.280]   I don't know should we expect it? What are you looking at?
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:07.480]   Is that a pixel? I'm in love. What the hell you got a pixel. I thought you canceled it. Oh, this is the review
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.080]   And you're in love
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:18.520]   I'm in love would you recommend that somebody spent $1,300 for that? I didn't do I did it. I did it. So that's interesting
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.800]   It's it's it's just too great the keyboard is butter
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.440]   The screen is so much better
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.680]   Unbelievable. I put it next to my mac now in the macbook's positively ASCII. Yeah
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.440]   Um
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.000]   And that'll give me trouble. No, well, but you're not you don't have a retina so no I don't write them
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.280]   And uh, it just solid it just it just you know, it just keeps working. That's the same reaction people with retinas. Please have but
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:50.120]   I just for vaults. Uh, did a uh, a song of praise to it on a little plus gushed gushed over
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.440]   Interesting now. Do you I wonder if he put littinix? Yeah, he said he was going to yeah
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.280]   Going but right now, but he said he might still use this as a browser machine. He got it
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.000]   So you can use crouton and we mentioned this last week
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.120]   You can use crouton as an emulator and put and use linnix within
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.560]   Chrome OS which to me would make it a lot more desirable to have a real operating a little bit of a real operating system
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:14.360]   Yeah, but then you know, but I hasn't hurt me. I'm using everything. I'm you it's
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.160]   comfortable and you can play google IO games
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.280]   I could I have the I do for it
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.960]   But not the binary codes or the or the patience
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:33.400]   Or the life life has anybody installed. I mean, have can we just put a bun-tou on it or some other?
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.920]   Yeah, I think you can as long as it's small enough to fit in the right memory that they give you
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.920]   That's the issue. So you can also you can boot from a from a thumb drive. You can boot from a thumb drive not you have faith three alas
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.120]   No, I think for a computer at that cost
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.760]   It has a fan
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:53.800]   The battery is a bit less, but here's the thing. I was I didn't know that the review unit
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.200]   I was sitting there somewhere. I didn't have Wi-Fi and it said, you know getting no cell
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.480]   I thought oh it has the cell coverage and boom. I was on and lte on it is unbelievable
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.000]   But you got the cell one
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.720]   Well, that's the review unit. That's the one to wait for probably it's a couple hundred bucks more but
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:15.960]   50 more permanent internet access pretty desirable and who's lte is for rising rising
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:21.800]   It's it is a sweet machine. I spent all day on browser
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.000]   Now do you think if you hadn't preconditioned yourself by using the Samsung Chromebook for a while? Absolutely
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.520]   I'd be I'd be one of those same. This is insane. I'd be the first I'm saying google's nuts
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.360]   I'd be I'd be saying all that right, but the Samsung just made me so comfortable with
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.880]   Living in the browser living in the cloud that
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:45.160]   You know, but the weakness of the Samsung was little too little memory little too tinny
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:51.320]   Pages would crap out it was a netbook. This isn't a real computer. This is a beautiful computer
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.040]   I got a site and so really the only question
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.680]   Is does it do enough?
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.480]   Right for us for a real computer and Jeff says yes
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.520]   And a lot do somebody in our chair. I'm just as a best computer ever used
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:07.960]   It's it's amazing and Chad. I'm now I'm gonna go nuts. I'm trying to you know that that client
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   for
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.080]   One of our users sent us. I want to get I want to die to get working
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.960]   So I don't have to haul along the Mac or when I travel four to five weeks for the lte version
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:23.480]   Yeah, now is this like the other so you get a hundred megabytes a month. No, you get a gigabyte
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.040]   You have any you get a
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.240]   Terabyte of download or download you know, it's a hundred megabytes unless you pay for more
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:40.120]   Well, that's intruders megabytes. Is that what it says? That's what the Samsung Chromebook you get a hundred megabytes a month pre included with a Verizon
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:47.560]   Hundred megabytes nothing. Yeah, it's like you can't even know it's a that's a kingdom. What's YouTube little bit of it. That's a come on
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.720]   It's a little bit less if you're in an emergency situation where you want to get some mail
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.400]   You don't have a Wi-Fi you can get your mail. Yeah, maybe as long as you don't have
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.120]   Attachments attachments. Yeah
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.840]   Well, I just ordered one just
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.880]   Order one. Yeah
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.440]   Jeff always can you know tricks me into that stuff
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.600]   No, what I did is and they say by the way four to five weeks for the lte and that's the one I ordered
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.160]   I'm not good. I think you're right. I think you want the lte if you're gonna
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.600]   I was gonna I see I thought I originally ordered was the lte and then I then I said no and I was gonna order the Wi-Fi
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   and then when I you know just the ease of I was sitting in the doctor's office today
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.120]   um
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.040]   And um just the ease of going flipping over to the lte and there I was
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:33.960]   It will do what I wanted to yeah, or if you're commuting or anything. I mean, it's yeah. I do love the corporate card
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:40.120]   Lee. I love the corporate card. I do love the corporate cards. What's he done? No
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.960]   Lucy
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   Got a question for you
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.560]   um
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.920]   64 gigs on the lte version two so that will be a little bit better for putting limits on yeah
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.080]   Which is one of the things I'm saying I think if you dual boot dual boot Linux
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.440]   I think it makes a lot of sense you could put Linux mint on that and be perfectly happy
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:04.440]   Yeah, yeah, then it's a real computer and it's a really nice real right right yeah
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:10.840]   Someone in the chat room said that half google employees use goobun to goobun to which I had to look up on wikipedia
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.880]   It's just kind of a light skin over you bun to and uh this person said sorry. I missed it
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:21.160]   It's scrolled up uh that you know it makes you wonder if they just want to make a really nice laptop for their employees
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.440]   Yeah, yeah, well, that's a good googles way right that's a good
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.160]   Make us something really good for googlers perfectly good justification
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:32.680]   It seems odd though this huge jump like they had all these low-end ones that everybody else was making and then all of a sudden
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.200]   It's like wam you know
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.640]   Why so the top
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.520]   Googlers said that they've been using this machine secretly inside the plex for a year
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.200]   So this thing this thing's been a developer for quite some time
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:51.240]   And we had somebody in the chat room our buyers right who was one of the on the team
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.600]   Last week right last week because he was so excited
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:00.840]   Well, he was so nervous. We i'd be using misinformation too. I think oh, yeah, maybe that's uh, I would imagine they assign
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.880]   People to the show
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:09.400]   Let's just see what uh what jeff and lee i would jeeter say today
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:16.200]   Oh, uh somebody on google plus posted all of the codes all the google io codes the ones and zeros
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.320]   Oh, that's not don't look at it. That spoils the fun
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.240]   what
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:27.160]   You should base pong. I'm just gonna use the pong one. Yeah, the pong one's great bacon simone eight-bit
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.400]   song synth asky bowling rocket and booger burger
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.160]   so
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.960]   And cat so don't look now close your eyes
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:43.240]   But uh, you now know the list of things you're going for that's what he should have published and then obfuscated the binary
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.640]   So that you know what you're going for how many total is that and that is
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.040]   six nine
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:59.640]   12 so if you don't if you can't get it so get you know collect all 12 collect all and that's what errands up to by the way right?
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.640]   Yeah, any more on the changelog?
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.800]   That's it. That's all I got. That's the google changelog

[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:03.560]   You're well. Here's a pretty big company right here. This one this one called twit. That's how we did how I did way back when it was just me
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.080]   I couldn't afford to go to a law firm and say let's create an LLC
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:12.680]   but I knew I wanted an LLC and uh and so 99 bucks that's a good deal
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.920]   And we're still using those basic operating agreements and everything
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.840]   um

[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.960]   In the past 12 years two million americans have used legal zoom
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.040]   To do what I just did uh, well five what I now is eight years ago
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:56.120]   LLCs wills trusts trademarks and more. It's very simple step-by-step questionnaire
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.800]   Total customer support in fact they've added something since I used it
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.040]   I really would have uh, I would have taken advantage of this
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.160]   Because sometimes as you're going through the questionnaire like they ask delo
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.360]   Where do what state do you want to be incorporated in and I thought, uh, california
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.720]   Or maybe delo where and I would have loved to ask an attorney now you can
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.720]   If you have questions or need advice you can access their extensive network of attorneys
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.160]   Legal zoom's legal plans are available in most states and you could search the online profiles and read
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.440]   Unedited customer reviews so you could pick the attorney that's right for you

[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.200]   You think I made a mistake buying that thing
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.320]   It's going to be four to five weeks. That's a long time
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.840]   You can change your mind between now and then which is what I do. I then I then go to ronnie
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.000]   Change it a couple of times. Yeah, I have changed a couple times
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.160]   I just I I you know
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.320]   My rule is if it's something I use absolutely every day all the time
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   Then I should get something good
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:47.960]   Well, I'm reviewing the the samson chrome book the high end one or higher end one that you like and everybody seems to like
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.480]   I'm reviewing that next week for before you buy and I'll use it and kind of get used to it
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:56.680]   This is the jub49 one. Yeah, and yeah, yeah, what it's so for that price
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.760]   I could buy five of those for one pixel
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.280]   but uh or four of those for one pixel but uh but um
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:09.320]   But the other advantage the other advantage well the advantage of the of the samson one is you get um
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:16.120]   Six and a half hours battery versus five. Yeah, and it's lighter and smaller, but it's in that book basically
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.320]   It's kind of it's not book, but it's really pretty amazing, but it's it's gonna feel
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.800]   You're happy. They're a workable botany
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   You're very happy that you got the pixel
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:29.000]   I yeah, well when I used the the samson for what six eight weeks
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.440]   Yeah, well, you know a long time in our world and uh and it was the only machine I was carrying with me
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.960]   I got I went on unless I had to do twig. I carried the
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:43.000]   Sam song with me on trips now you mentioned that maybe there'll be a motor roller nexus
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.880]   I don't know after reading this google's cfo says
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.840]   eh
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.080]   And a motor roll of stuff. It's not up to our standards
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:39:00.200]   Yeah, now and he didn't he didn't say the the existing stuff. He said kind of the the new stuff too
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:07.160]   I happened to agree with him. Yeah, uh, this hired guy kalasaki. I think to be a console to roll it did
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.160]   Yeah, I don't know if that's gonna make a huge
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.160]   Patrick pishette who's a
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.920]   Chief financial officer and senior vice president at google said the products in motor roll as pipeline
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.240]   That's the upcoming ones are quote not really up to the standards
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:28.520]   That what google would say is wow innovative transformative transformative. This was at the morgan Stanley technology conference
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.800]   Now that's how you sell devices. Yeah, yes. It's not gonna be the nexus motor roller
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:39.320]   He said we've inherited 18 months of pipeline that we actually have to drain right now. It's like a puss jewel
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:46.680]   While we're actually building the next wave of innovation and product lines boy. They wow that is harsh
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.000]   Well talk about managed expectations now
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.960]   I think I think it's actually smart to extend that
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:56.120]   Any new motor roller products come up here and say this is best can do
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.880]   And google's gonna say we told you this is uh, yeah, we're still clearing the puss out of the pipeline
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.200]   That's strange that their pipeline is so long
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.080]   18 months. Well, i'm is that strange? She thinks that's an angel for it. I think it's a little long. I mean seems a little long
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.960]   But i hope that that was the problem. Oh, yeah
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.080]   Yeah, yeah
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.920]   Detroit is it naive for me to say like why don't they just shut down the pipeline if they really don't think these products are any good
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.960]   Why don't they just stop it?
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.720]   Well, I think that was the implication and he says it just the transition is an instant that's yeah
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   But I think that's kind of the implication is we're probably we're not going to make this stuff
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.400]   Um
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.520]   But it would make sense that at some point maybe not by iotime the next nexus
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.280]   Unnexus will start coming from motor roll instead of anybody else or maybe not
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:47.720]   Maybe you know google's got to be a great pains to tell the other android handset makers
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.520]   Hey, we're not going to give motor roll a special treatment
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.080]   Because if if that really were the perception, I don't know that could be a risky thing, right?
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   Even you know sam's song is is kind of signaling that to google by saying hey, we got tyson
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.720]   We got windows phones. We don't have to make android phones
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:09.080]   I don't know. Yeah, i'm surprised that they haven't done more with motor roller
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:15.000]   But i've also been through acquisitions on a number of occasions. I know you came to oracle through it acquisition
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.520]   That's right. I came to oracle through sun. Yeah, um and you know
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:24.760]   I wonder if google I mean this was a big acquisition for google too. I wonder if there's some learning going on here
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.400]   Oh, yeah, uh skill they don't really well they yeah, they don't really have it. It's a such a different company
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.600]   I mean they do acquisitions they do acquisitions all the time, but it's usually like no web startups, you know
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.920]   Oh 10 people here 10 people there
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:42.840]   Um, but this is a big corporation with obviously a long pipeline of hardware products. So
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.560]   Maybe they're still learning how to how to do it. I mean
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.960]   I don't know
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:53.480]   And the chowroom bear just said uh motor roll was bought for its radio tech google glass needed small fast radios
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:42:00.760]   I like it bears our assisted men and uh is very smart used to work for the mozilla foundation. Um, that makes sense
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.640]   And a good point and they sold off the set top division which we thought for a while
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.320]   Maybe was one of the reasons they bought it. Yeah, right. We thought maybe google tv
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.960]   The other thing of course that it's obvious is they bought them for their patents. Yeah
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.920]   Yeah, and of course they have relationships with the um
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.840]   with the verisans and the atnts and those people too like
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.440]   Um, the some of these products may have been hey look
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.960]   Here's our road map and everybody agreed to it and signed off on it and was happy with it
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.720]   Maybe they have agreements they can't back out of
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:38.680]   Now if you're google and you're under investigation by the chairman of the ftc seems like it would be a good idea to donate
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:43.800]   Let's say I don't know 25 large to an event honoring the chairman of the fcc
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.480]   Maybe you might get some good stuff out of that. That's what happened
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.520]   uh
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.080]   The ftc says we didn't know that
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.560]   Right hand should have talked to left out. Uh, we didn't know that
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:03.560]   Um, the implication being well since we didn't know it it couldn't have had any implication in the fact that we let google off
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:09.720]   Pretty light in our investigation. I don't you know, let's be honest 25 grand to honor the fcc chair
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:15.800]   Let's let it let's talk to honor him. It's to support the charity that used honoring him as their excuse to
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.760]   Beg for money. So this is common sense media. I don't know who common sense media is. Let's look that up
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.160]   Uh, but that's that's where the money went. Uh, leave of us didn't benefit in any way
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   It's you got to eat free chicken. Whoo. Yeah big deal ftc says chairman lee wits had no idea
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.760]   Google was one of many corporate sponsors to the event until he read the article
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:40.840]   But he's grateful and honored to accept the war from common sense media, which does so much for kids and families in privacy
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.080]   What a politician
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:49.960]   This doesn't seem like an on story. Yeah, well, I think you got to report it, but I don't know if it uh, yeah
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.920]   I think you could safely say man probably didn't make a difference
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:44:01.960]   Uh, so google won in the boondish dog, right? Is that what you and you know mind fronk? Uh, they didn't they didn't fully win
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:10.040]   Okay, they were smart to take it to the german legislature. Oh no they weren't no no no what happened here was mind fronk
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.080]   They gave hadd get the reggae ready
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.280]   And if we get a light shung zee truck sighting
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:23.640]   So flange to have my mother was that this law was going to to require the licensing of significance
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.520]   Right. Yeah
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:32.520]   There's two versions of it by the way now, um, so there are acquired licenses snippets of last minute
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:40.360]   Uh, one of the parties proposed a compromise that that's that exempted things you're gonna love this up to 160 characters
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.680]   Like like tweet length and then that didn't survive but instead they said okay
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.560]   a wellword or very few words, um, you could do for free
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.040]   So like like freeze up the word v nobody can own the word v
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.120]   He licensed the word v well, that's really yeah, my sir
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:03.240]   So, uh, but but the problem is there is no definition of a snippet
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:08.680]   So this is gonna go on and on and so google google said oh, well, we're glad you got rid of the snippet thing
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.200]   But still it's dangerous and bad. I think it's horribly dangerous and bad
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:18.840]   Uh, I wrote a post about this that was then translated into an op-ed at, uh, site and tug-ish beagle
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:23.800]   And in which I I ridiculed this law and everything about it
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:30.440]   And but also said that I think it indicates a problem with germany and technology and this your arguments have been on the show before
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:38.680]   Um, and then christoph kaysa who's the architect of this bill from actual springer a big publisher kind of the the news corp of germany
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.000]   Uh came into we had a little back and forth in twitter about this
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.720]   Uh where he was trying to argue that, um, uh, the gutenberg stuff. You don't get me on gutenberg man
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.800]   I was defending the gutenberg view
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.640]   Uh
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.760]   So as it is he continues it's it's not over google didn't win they've they won a a
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.840]   You know that much
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:07.080]   But we all lost because of this idea that you could license content for a year and not quote it without licensing it
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.120]   Um is is obviously incredibly dangerous and by the way dangerous to media companies
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.880]   How does actual springer get its content they quote a lot of people
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.840]   Um, uh, so
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.120]   No, it's not over now. What's gonna do is now going to go to the higher house
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:29.160]   And there that's controlled by the liberals and uh, the hope is that it will get defeated there, but we don't know
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:35.400]   Uh, this is an election year thing when maracle the conservative party is giving this to actual springer and berta the publishers
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.880]   So there's still danger danger danger danger out there folks
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.600]   stranger danger
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.600]   Yeah, um
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.520]   Okay, this is really annoying and when I go to pakasa web.com
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.360]   Which is google's photo sharing service pakasa web
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:54.120]   I get sent to not pakasa web but
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.600]   google plus
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.840]   Ah the classification of pakasa
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.600]   It does pop up a little thing click here to go back to pakasa web albums
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.720]   But how long is that gonna be there are your photos moved over to all i moved over to plus then
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.960]   Uh
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:15.720]   Photos yes, it's the same albums and actually they're bigger thumbnails, which is nice
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.440]   But, uh, i'm a little i'm a little puzzled, you know, I mean, um
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.480]   Does this mean it's the end of pakasa web?
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:28.680]   Hmm do they incorporate all the functionality of pakasa web
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:35.400]   Yeah, that's the question there were some features in that pakasa web had that I didn't find in certainly didn't have in google
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.080]   Doesn't look like it it seems kind of like you could have real question
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.240]   They have been adding more and more features to google plus
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.960]   I mean, maybe they finally got to the point now where they're like, okay, we're close enough
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.960]   We can merge the two services. Let me let me you click it click on a photo
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.600]   Yeah, this is all google plus here
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.440]   um
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.440]   I do have edit photo
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.440]   Magic rules a lot of tools in edit photo
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:03.160]   Uh, I guess this is I don't know I'd have to really do a a one-to-one comparison is this aviary
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.680]   Might be yeah rotate sharpen resize
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:13.080]   Yeah, actually there's some nice tools. Okay, maybe what what we would do? Maybe the chat room
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:19.400]   More familiar with the pakasa web than I am I do upload everything there, but ironically I do it mostly through google plus
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.000]   Photo sharing right so instant upload instant upload so um
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.080]   But maybe the chat room knows what features are there or should be there
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.440]   I don't
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.680]   Everything that I would use is there but uh
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.200]   And now it's google plus
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.760]   How about how about sharing with other people? I guess that's part of plus built-in right?
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:44.920]   The problem I have in plus photos is I can't email a photo unless I'm stupid never figured out
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.320]   Really?
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.800]   Mmm. Hmm or I can't save it. You're not gonna do it safe. Hold on
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.640]   Yeah, you just shared on google plus with an email address. Yeah, and it emails it automatically
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:02.200]   Oh, you're kidding me. Mmm. Yeah, that's microsoft. Think it is a little uh, yeah
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.800]   Huh
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.960]   You don't want to have oh dumb moments. Okay showing the ex if
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.400]   Yeah, I guess this is much of the same
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.840]   um information
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.120]   It's interesting though. It's kind of hidden under the google plus ui
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:26.200]   Um, anyway, that's I guess goodbye pakasa web. I think you got to say that right?
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.040]   Yeah, and if all the features are the same, I mean it doesn't make sense to keep to
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:36.200]   It's better. Yeah bigger thumbnails. It's pretty. Yeah, you're used to using it. It's kind of a natural way to share
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.760]   I love how we just took that arc there where leo was
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.960]   Makes me it makes me nervous because I
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.080]   I don't like seeing google plusification of everything
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:49.320]   But on the other hand if it's if you don't lose any features and you get new features
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.960]   Yes, see the the one that I was uh
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.480]   Never had in google area in google plus was the ability to move
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:59.640]   Photos around in your album so they come up and now I can do it. Yeah, it's nice
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:05.080]   I look at drag and drop. Yeah, look look like a flicker folks where it was bought and then utterly orphaned and abandoned
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:10.040]   Right and this could have been the fate of pakasa. Whereas now you know google is going to care about right because the photos
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.280]   This is all part of plus and they love plus right you do or not
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.920]   Uh, so guess what uh google
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.680]   Googles
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:23.960]   This is this is interesting uh danny Sullivan writing in the search engine watch talks about
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:29.720]   uh, the national security letter fbi national security letter and google
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.400]   Revealing I think this is something they're not supposed to reveal, but maybe
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:38.840]   So look how they revealed at leo they revealed not much but they wanted to reveal something
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.600]   Aren't you at least under the patriot act you're kind of not supposed to say anything
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.160]   You're not supposed to say specific numbers or specific cases
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:51.400]   So what they did look at they revealed a gigantic range of numbers and was there kind of a little slap to the feds saying
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.600]   We can't be transparent because you're not letting us be right here's here's but but
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:02.440]   When conducting national security investigations the usfbi can issue a national security letter to obtain
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.000]   Identifying information about a subscriber
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:11.080]   From telephone and internet companies in other words. They send out a letter which says who was that using
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.240]   Uh, you know gmail at this time in this date with this ip address
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:20.680]   Fbi has the authority to prohibit companies from talking about these requests. That's a patriot act feature
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:26.520]   But we've been trying to find a way to provide more information about the national security letters we get
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.680]   Particularly as people have voiced concerns about the increase in their use since 9/11
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.240]   Because it's not uh, over there's no oversight from a judge or anything
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.680]   It's not a it's not a it's not a warrant. It's just an nsl
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:43.960]   Today we're going to start including data about nsl's in our transparency report
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.480]   We're thankful to the us government officials
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.800]   For working with us to provide greater insights. So I guess they've asked permission
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.960]   But you're right it's not a lot of information
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:01.160]   Because it says you're range you can see there is a one year had more than other years, right?
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:10.520]   We're reporting numerical ranges rather than exact numbers. This is to raise concerns by raised by the fbi justice department and other agencies
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.560]   We planned to update these regularly
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:18.120]   This is actually quite interesting. I remember I think was maybe a month ago or so. They said they were going to start publishing
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.120]   10
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.000]   Warrants and how many warrants and subpoenas and stuff they get
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   Right, um
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.640]   So they're just adding to that same report the well what we know is they've received zero
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:33.160]   last four years between zero and a thousand
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.880]   nsl's
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:41.160]   For and the only thing that's different is the number of accounts the users number of users and the number of accounts
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.400]   and uh, it's actually uh, it peaked at 2010
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.400]   and uh
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.640]   About twice as many in 2010 apparently
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.480]   or roughly
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.120]   Uh, but it's somewhere between a thousand and two thousand
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.200]   last year
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.720]   accounts
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.560]   Doesn't really tell you a whole lot doesn't it? No, no, I just told you it's a total number. Yeah
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:07.400]   All right, and then the request by reporting period percentage of requests where some data
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.120]   Was produced is very close to a hundred
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.700]   (laughs)
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:16.500]   - Actually it's going down, it's going down.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.880]   That's that graph on the right, Chad.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.920]   - And then down below that it tells you
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.300]   the details of the search warrants,
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.720]   and the subpoenas, and other.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.200]   I don't know what other it is but.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.500]   - Well good on Google for at least attempting
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.640]   to reveal something,
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.900]   - Exactly.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.720]   - I mean the transparency report is great,
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.480]   but all this does is really that they've got
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.000]   more requests than 2010 than they did in 2009.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.440]   - I think what it really says is this is happening,
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.800]   and we just want you to know we're not allowed to tell you,
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.080]   but we do want to let you know it is happening.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:50.920]   - Yeah.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:54.080]   - And the government won't let us tell you anything
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.080]   or not much anyway.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:00.120]   Google's services should not require real name,
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   says the father of the internet.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.200]   Thank you, Vince Surf,
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.440]   but you better talk to Larry about that.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.280]   - Yeah.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.200]   - He's right, he says,
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.480]   in the face of increasing government crackdowns,
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.920]   Google should not force internet users to reveal
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.800]   their real names for some services,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.900]   including Google plus, says Vince Surf.
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.920]   Now you don't call the father of the internet
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.320]   or the carpet, so I don't know what the reason.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.660]   What you do at this point.
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:31.400]   - But you know, there's this,
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.840]   there's becoming this overarching rule that says
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   that requiring names is bad, right?
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.200]   So shift to another example.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   LinkedIn would be clearly useless without real names, right?
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.000]   Makes absolutely no sense.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.800]   Like there's no possible use of LinkedIn
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.080]   without real names on the one extreme, right?
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.760]   And on the other stream is for Jan.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.640]   - Right.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.520]   Totally anonymous.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:59.160]   - Right, in the middle, there is, I think,
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:03.520]   pardon me, some right, even responsibility
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.520]   to try to determine the rules
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.400]   of a platform and a community you start, right?
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   And I always argue that Facebook's key differentiator
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.720]   was that it brought real names and real identity
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:21.200]   and real relationships to an otherwise too anonymous web.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.120]   And we grabbed that because we wanted that,
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.960]   because we were sick of just nothing but trolls everywhere.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:31.160]   And so I think that was a benefit, right?
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.840]   And then, yeah, anonymity has its place,
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.160]   anonymity is important, but real relationships
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.040]   and real people also have their place that are important.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.400]   And I don't think there's anything wrong with requiring that.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.200]   The problem comes in at the moment where Facebook or Google
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.720]   becomes a platform for communication that are necessary
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.120]   by those who are using anonymity for a reason, right?
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:56.040]   Witness what happened to Wildman Eam in Egypt with Facebook.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.920]   Facebook was a place to go get people in Egypt.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.880]   He didn't wanna start an account with his own name.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.520]   But he couldn't.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:05.040]   So there's some exception needed for those circumstances,
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.240]   but I think it's perfectly legitimate for Facebook
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.400]   and Google+ to say, this is a place for real people,
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.240]   that's what we're trying to do.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.440]   - Encourage but not require?
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.760]   - Right, right.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.800]   Because essentially, isn't the service gonna be the thing
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   that says, I want to use my real name because
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.760]   of the benefits that I get from that?
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.080]   - Yeah, but you've already gone over the edge.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.440]   You've gone over the edge to troll land.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.160]   And I'm not saying, by the way, let me make very clear here.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.040]   I'm not saying that identity exterminates trolls.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.880]   I just wrote a big piece for Medium about this,
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.000]   arguing the opposite.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:36.880]   - Oh really?
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.760]   - Now that's intriguing.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.360]   I always thought that if somebody uses a real name,
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.280]   they're much less likely to troll.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.120]   - Well, I can name some trolls by name.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.520]   - Yeah, but they will look at perfect examples,
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:54.600]   the Reddit troll who was outed and has disappeared.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.440]   - And it stopped him, right?
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.120]   But I can also very much name some trolls by name.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.160]   I'm not going to 'cause I'm not gonna be a satisfaction.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.480]   - That's the point.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.120]   - Right, am I carrying ten years?
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.000]   (laughing)
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.120]   - That's your troll.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.000]   I didn't call the troll.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.240]   No, sorry.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.800]   - Well, I quite publicly call them a troll,
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.360]   so there's no taking that back.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:19.840]   But I try attempted on Medium to define a troll.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.080]   I think we're gonna be talking about this last week.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.240]   - I don't remember it.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.120]   - Oh.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.520]   - There's a book out called, may I use the word
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.920]   ahole spelled out or not?
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.680]   - Yeah, ahole just like that.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.680]   - Just like that, okay.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.520]   So there's a book called Aholes a Theory.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.360]   (laughing)
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.600]   - I wanna read that.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.920]   - In what is the theory?
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.000]   (laughing)
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.200]   - Defined Aholes.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.480]   And it's a whole book and it's very smart and very clever
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.560]   and goes on, but then I argue that he left out
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.600]   a key genus of the species.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.360]   Which is trolls.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:00.280]   So if you go to medium.com,
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.080]   where are you gonna find it?
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:04.000]   But I'll send it to you right now in the rundown.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:04.840]   - Okay.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.320]   - E, can I send it to you in the script?
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.880]   No, I can't do that.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.800]   - You could send it, but I don't know who would get it.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.080]   - If you go to medium.com at Jeff Jarvis,
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.160]   you'll see it's the second, second,
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.920]   I can call Defining the Troll.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.720]   - Right, so what I said is the troll,
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.040]   so there's a definition of ahole there.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.360]   And then I come down later where you see the one, two, three.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.600]   The definition of troll.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:30.320]   And his view is that an ahole,
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.200]   you know, it'd be nicer if we just actually use the word
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.920]   'cause that sounds even worse, but anyway,
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.120]   allows himself to enjoy special advantages
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.240]   and does so systematically.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.120]   Two, does this out of an entrenched sense of entitlement?
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.280]   And three is immunized by his sense of entitlement
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.960]   against complaints of other people.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.680]   - Yes, I'd agree with all that.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.520]   - I think it's right.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:50.160]   So I say what distinguishes the troll from the mere ahole is
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.400]   that he, and by the way, I figured no women were gonna
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.320]   complain about me using the male gender
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.240]   for the most troll, our male.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.400]   - I support the use of he here.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.760]   (laughing)
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.480]   - Now there's got to be female trolls.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.560]   I know female trolls, there are female trolls.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.600]   - Sure, but we don't have to talk about that.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.440]   (laughing)
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.360]   - So, we're going, he has a target.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:11.080]   Number two, he seeks to get a response,
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:11.920]   a rise out of it.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.680]   - I would disagree on he has a target.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.560]   A lot of trolling is, for instance,
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.720]   we have trolls coming to the chat room,
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.760]   they're not targeting anything.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:20.880]   They just want the attention.
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.920]   - They certainly want negative attention.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.840]   - But where do they choose to do it?
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.800]   Okay, that's a good point.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.200]   - No, well, it depends on what form you're using,
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:33.200]   but I think a lot of trolls do not have a specific target.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.920]   They, in fact, most successfully target everyone.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.720]   - Right. (laughing)
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.120]   - Well, this goes back to number three then,
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.080]   which is the believes he's acting out of some ordained
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.840]   moral purpose to destroy, to bring down his heart.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.600]   - I disagree with that as well.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.400]   - I think that's an ahole.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.240]   - Yeah.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.840]   - But I think a troll is not, really, I think very simply,
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.400]   in my opinion, having lots of experience with trolls,
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.400]   it's somebody who wants attention of any kind,
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.080]   even if it's negative attention.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.320]   - Well, I think that's more ahole behavior.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.160]   I think the troll is a step beyond that.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.320]   (laughing)
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.000]   - Like it wants destruction.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.200]   - Well, it's a, no, I don't know about that.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.120]   It's a destructive behavior.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.440]   But I'm not sure I would ascribe the intent to destroy
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.400]   as the motivating force.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400]   And some it is.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.240]   - Right, right.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.080]   - I think it is.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.400]   But I think in a great many, it is not.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.000]   They just want attention.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.680]   - Hmm.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.520]   - Interesting.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.560]   - I think, you know who should weigh in
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.480]   is our chat mods in the chat room,
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.240]   because they deal with trolls all the time.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.680]   And there maybe are different kinds of trolls.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:35.680]   Maybe there's forum trolls.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.520]   - I think that's what we do.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.360]   - Chat trolls.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.200]   - Yeah.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.480]   - But I think that a troll is happiest
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.920]   when they've created conflict.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.440]   They've left a trail of annoyed people behind them,
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.840]   but mostly what they want is a lot of people
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.720]   talking about them.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.440]   And they're not so very different from John Hinckley
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.800]   or anybody who wants attention
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.240]   and is willing to do something really offensive to get it.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.000]   - Hmm.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   - Hmm.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:05.840]   - That's my theory.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.680]   - That's my theory.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.520]   - I was trying to make a point.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.040]   Yeah, I think there's probably both ways.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.680]   I mean, the Reddit troll is just trying to make a point.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.840]   Trolls I've dealt with him
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.880]   at least sort of pick a target.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.680]   - Well, because you're the target.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.440]   (laughing)
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.960]   - And I suppose you could make the case that I or Twitter
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.600]   are the targets in the chat room.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.760]   They certainly choose that.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.600]   That's what I'm gonna say.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.040]   - Yeah, there's something about that person
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.360]   or that place or that company or that forum
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.360]   that triggers something and then that makes them feel like,
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.440]   I have my job to disrupt this place.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.280]   - Right, right.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.120]   Exactly.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.000]   And by their action, they are showing disdain
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.680]   for the place they're schmoozing.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.240]   - Actually, this is another,
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.300]   I'll file a dissenting opinion.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.520]   So oftentimes, trolls love the place they're trolling.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.040]   - Really?
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.140]   - Yeah, it's the kid who dips your pigtails into the ink.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:59.360]   That really is a, I think trolls are,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.760]   it's a form of, you know, some mental problem.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.640]   And somebody who, as a kid, got negative attention
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.400]   is maybe the only attention they got from their parent.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.680]   And they really like somebody
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.880]   and what they want is attention
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.200]   and they only know how to get negative attention.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.560]   So if they're targeting you,
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.280]   it may not be targeting you to destroy you.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.240]   It may in fact merely be targeting you to get your attention.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.360]   - Right, then lying between love and hate thing.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.200]   - Yeah.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.840]   - But are you gonna use the word appropriately?
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.360]   - That's creepy.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]   - Well, yeah.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.480]   - It's a little creepy.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.480]   Look, here's my, this is a, you know.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.320]   - That's stalking.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.760]   - A lay psychology, okay?
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.280]   But my lay psychology is, here's a kid
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.880]   didn't get enough attention, as a kid
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.200]   did not get enough attention.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.680]   The only attention he got from his mom
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.760]   or his dad was negative.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.840]   It stopped that, knock it off, get out of here.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.120]   But it was the only attention he got
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   and he learned that was the closest thing to love
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.040]   he was gonna get from a parent.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.280]   Goes up, grows up into life
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.040]   and still craves that kind of attention
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.000]   because for him or her,
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.280]   that's the attention they know
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.680]   and that's what it equates to love.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.480]   And I think very frequently--
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.120]   - That's the Howard Stern analysis.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.560]   Sit down, shut up, you moron.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.480]   Say to his father.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.440]   - Yeah.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.760]   - So that's what you're saying is that analysis.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.560]   - And we get, I mean, I only say that
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.040]   because maybe that's the kind of troll we get.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.920]   There are certainly trolls.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.640]   There are really evil people who go after people,
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.560]   the creepers, the stalkers.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.120]   That's not a troll to me.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.200]   That's a different thing.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.520]   That's a stalker.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.200]   But a troll is somebody who goes into a community
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.600]   and disrupts it.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.160]   But it's my opinion, they don't disrupt it
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.320]   because they dislike the community.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.200]   They disrupt it 'cause they wanna be a part of the community
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.080]   and they want the community's attention.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.520]   - I think that's even what that guy from Reddit
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.720]   said in the interview, didn't he?
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.800]   He's like, this was my life.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.720]   This is what I lived for.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.560]   - He loved it.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.400]   - I love it.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.400]   - He loved it, he got the attention.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.240]   - He got the attention.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.080]   - But he loved it.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:47.920]   - He loved Reddit.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.760]   I mean, he loved Reddit.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.600]   - He loved Reddit.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.760]   - He exploited Reddit's policies about his speech.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.440]   - Well, he also loved Reddit because it enabled him
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.920]   anonymously to do this.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.960]   - Yeah, but that's where he chose that was his forum.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.520]   He chose that as his forum.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:02.920]   Anyway, so a troll may not be a nayhole.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:03.760]   - Atrial.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.640]   - It's an action that we have a disagreement in taxonomy here.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.960]   - I don't know if it's germane.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.200]   I do, well, it is germane because understanding
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.440]   the person's motivation will help you in dealing
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.440]   with the person, but at least it'll take some
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.520]   of the sting out of it.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.360]   - I think there's some people
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.560]   that don't know their trolls.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.400]   Do you think?
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.240]   - Oh, most trolls don't know their trolls.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.720]   - I mean, they just wanna argue.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:22.560]   - Yeah.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.680]   - You know, who was a troll is our lead moderator, Dan,
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.680]   was a horrendous troll.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.120]   That's how I first met him.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.280]   I banned him three or four times from our forums.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.840]   It wasn't chat, it was a forum.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.840]   He acknowledges this, I'm not saying anything.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.720]   But I hung with him and he kept coming back.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.080]   And eventually I realized he just really wants to play.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.280]   And now he's like, he's still a little trollish
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.120]   from time to time.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.440]   (laughing)
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.880]   'Cause he likes conflict, I think.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.000]   But he is our most ardent volunteer
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.600]   and has been for 10 years.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.560]   - That's a really big accomplishment.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.400]   - Interesting.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.840]   - To change a troll into a contributor, that's big.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.840]   I think that it's possible in many cases.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.120]   Poacher turned gamekeepers, says Charlie.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.240]   (laughing)
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.840]   But who better for trolls than an ex troll?
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.280]   - Right, yeah.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:18.680]   - I think often, oh, now I'm gonna really get in trouble.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.320]   Police officers, if they weren't police officers,
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.360]   it'd be criminals.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.720]   - Well, that's the basic 30s movie plot
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.840]   of the good brother and the bad brother, the priest.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.440]   - I don't know.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.280]   - Where'd I go?
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.680]   - I got some anonymity.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.520]   (laughing)
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.360]   - Anonymity.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.920]   Back to anonymity.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.280]   Vince says we're doing the right thing.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.400]   We're doing it just right.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.640]   The EFF base to differ.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:49.320]   Gillian, I can't, I'm finding the article again.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.880]   We got off on that troll thing.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.560]   Let me back up a couple of pages back here.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.200]   By the way, medium.com, we've talked about it before.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.480]   Jeff writes some great stuff there.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.240]   I don't know why you're giving it away to have,
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.720]   but go ahead, keep up the good work.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.160]   - The crew does look pretty though.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.440]   - Gillian York of the EFF, it has, look,
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.800]   it's really pretty, it's great.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.040]   I just wouldn't give my work away.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.280]   Gillian says, "Google's approach to this takes the view
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.520]   "that the only thing people want to stay safe from
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.160]   "is government."
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.440]   And that's one reason, and there's certainly one reason,
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.480]   but that's not entirely true.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.280]   People are also concerned about staying protected from Google.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.560]   - It's self. - Yeah.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.520]   - Oh, we didn't think of that, says Vince, Surf.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.280]   We're the good guys.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.040]   - But Vince and the EFF agree, don't they?
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.240]   - Well, Vince, what they disagree on is that Vince thinks
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.360]   Google's doing enough to protect anonymity.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.040]   I'm not sure the EFF agrees.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.720]   - Right, because users have the choice, right,
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.000]   to display a pseudonym.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.480]   So they give you a real name,
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.840]   but then only display a pseudonym.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.960]   - Right, Google knows your real name,
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.360]   and what the EFF is saying is, well, that's,
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.800]   okay, that's an anonymity from somebody,
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.160]   but Google, others and Google,
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.960]   but maybe they want to be anonymous from Google.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.800]   - Right.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.920]   - And since the Google is responding
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.120]   to these national security letters,
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.120]   that may be synonymous with being anonymous from the government.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.240]   - Well, but the problem in that scenario
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.920]   is the government again, not Google.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.240]   Tell me where Google has harmed someone.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.080]   - They don't have any choice.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:16.920]   - I know either identity.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.760]   - Well, we don't know.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.400]   I mean, I just had this long argument on security now
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.560]   with Steve Gibson, who thinks that tracking cookies harm you,
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.800]   that's what Google engages in very actively.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.800]   - Sorry. - Could harm you.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.800]   (laughs)
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.680]   - Well, yeah, I don't want to get that.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:34.520]   Anyway, moving on.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.600]   (laughs)
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.880]   There's a rabbit down there.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.520]   - Moving on, that's a big rabbit hole.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.920]   That's a long one, which we've gone down many times before.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.000]   - Yes.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.040]   - All right, YouTube's gonna watch a music service
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.400]   to compete with Spotify.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.840]   What do you think?
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.840]   Now, is that a rumor?
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.160]   I think it, I don't think Google's confirmed it.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.600]   - Well, they've got deals now.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.040]   - Apparently they would be with Warner and Universal, I think.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:00.880]   - And?
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.720]   - Was it Universal?
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.560]   - I can't remember, but--
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.200]   - This comes from Fortune, which was briefed on the service
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.560]   by sources in the record industry,
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.080]   and those at Google who declined to be named.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:13.440]   YouTube said, "While we don't comment on rumor or speculation,
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.880]   there are some content creators that think they would benefit
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.240]   from a subscription revenue stream in addition to ads."
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.800]   So we're looking at that.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.320]   That's not, that by the way, that could very well
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.560]   just be people who wanna do pay-per-view on YouTube,
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.920]   which they are, we know doing.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.880]   I think this is one of the few companies
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.360]   that could come marching into this space and do well.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.280]   - Yeah, I mean, they've already got a music,
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.320]   a good music service.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.440]   Well, they've got all the stuff on YouTube,
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.800]   but then they have Google music.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.160]   They're already doing things like content matching,
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.000]   when you upload your, I mean,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.640]   so they've got, it seems like they've got all the pieces.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.920]   What they don't have is all of the content itself.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.960]   They don't have licenses to do.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.040]   - Just Warners and somebody else.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.640]   You gotta get them all.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.560]   - Yeah, you gotta get them all,
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.400]   and then that makes you really competitive, I think.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:06.240]   - But Billboard last year started including YouTube views
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.640]   into the Billboard charts.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.200]   That's how Harlem Shake went to number one.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.640]   Call me maybe.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.200]   Opo Gangnam Style.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.840]   Somebody that I used to know from,
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.800]   as I've been told, it's pronounced, Go T.A.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.640]   - Go, thank you.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.880]   - Oh, I didn't know about that.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.160]   - Yeah, I didn't need it.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.000]   - It's not Go T.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:27.840]   - I've been saying gotcha.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.720]   (laughing)
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.720]   - I knew it was Go T.A.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.360]   I didn't realize that the song had gotten that popular
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.920]   because of the views.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.240]   - Yeah, 380 million views.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.560]   You know, the two things that are very similar
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.880]   between Opo Gangnam Style and somebody that I used to know
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.040]   is that in both cases, there were a lot of parodies,
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.600]   remixes, tributes, and that's got,
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.520]   there's such a lesson there.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.840]   - There's so much about it.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.680]   - Let it go.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.520]   - Call me maybe too.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.680]   There were hundreds of call me maybe.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.800]   - Oh my word.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.640]   - So what a surprise.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.800]   - In Harlem Shake, do I have to say anymore?
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.920]   That's the way that you wanna get viral, go viral,
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.240]   let everybody remix and modify your stuff.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.280]   - All of them have it.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.440]   Amanda Palmer did a really, really, really good TED Talk.
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.360]   I know I'm overdue to ask her to be on the show
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:23.360]   and talked about how she realized the change came
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.600]   in trying to force people to pay
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.840]   versus allowing them to pay.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.000]   - Yeah.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.440]   - And that it's really about a relationship,
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.960]   but she understands the relationship she has
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.200]   with the public and it works.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.640]   And I even showed the entire video
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.960]   to my entrepreneurial students saying,
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.760]   this is a new business model.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:40.600]   It's a different business model.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.720]   We had Perry Chen co-founder of Kickstarter in,
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:44.760]   and it's the same kind of thing.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.400]   It's you allow people to act as a patron for something.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.480]   You allow them to remix something.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.080]   You change your relationship with them
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.520]   in a way that's not a relationship before us,
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.200]   and you, Leo, are very good at that.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.040]   - Thank you.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:01.880]   Amanda is a musician, achieves some real success.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.480]   She did a raise of 1.2 million on Kickstarter.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.360]   - Kickstarter album.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.040]   And uses Google+ and uses all the modern tools.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.840]   - Speaking of Harlem Shake and YouTube,
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.720]   you have gone to youtube.com
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.000]   and searched for you the Harlem Shake, right?
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.280]   - Yeah, I can't believe that wasn't on the change log.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.920]   - I know, well, I thought about it.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.520]   I didn't know, I was like Easter eggs.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.160]   I don't know if those count.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.120]   - It's not a change, but let's just,
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.960]   for those who haven't done it,
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.440]   let's just show them, you go to youtube.com
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.680]   and you should do this in Chrome.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.280]   I tried it in an Explorer, it didn't work.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.120]   - It didn't work.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.520]   - Yeah, do the Harlem Shake.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.960]   And is it gonna do it?
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.400]   Whoa.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.880]   - Whoa.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.280]   - Did I type it wrong?
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.080]   - Are you in IE right now?
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.760]   - I must be in IE.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.800]   No, isn't this Chrome, this Chrome?
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.040]   - Maybe you need to actually type it, Leo.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.600]   - Oh, hand by hand?
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.720]   - Yeah, that's gonna be fucking page.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.120]   - Do the Harlem Shake.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.800]   That's what I'm supposed to type, right?
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.640]   - Yep.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:08.080]   - Maybe they turned it off.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:11.040]   Am I, oh, I mean, I, you know, Chrome and IE
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.200]   look so much, oh, shut up.
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.800]   (laughing)
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.320]   Shut up.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.080]   No way now.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.600]   So first the YouTube logo itself shakes back and forth
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.200]   and then after the drop, the whole page.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.120]   - The whole page does advance.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.640]   - So silly.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.880]   I don't know, I guess 'cause I'm just over the Harlem Shake.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.520]   - I think I was over it before it came out.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.520]   - Yeah, it was thesis.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.240]   - I think they show those things to Larry
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.840]   before they put them up.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.800]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.360]   Why is Gita getting brighter and brighter?
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.720]   - Oh, they're so sorry, I'm adjusting my settings
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:50.520]   and kinda get, I'm not.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.120]   (laughing)
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:52.960]   - Is it?
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.400]   - Is there an asteroid that's breaking up
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.800]   near where you are?
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.600]   - It's just, it's getting brighter here
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.040]   'cause I'm in San Diego, so the sun's getting a little lower
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:05.080]   and I'm sitting in front of a window, so that should be better.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.040]   - Gita's coming to us from a Russian dashboard cam somewhere.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:08.880]   (laughing)
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.720]   - Oh, you cray.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.080]   - What's your settings, Gina?
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.760]   How do you do that?
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.960]   - It's in a webcam setting, the webcam settings panel.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.800]   - You know.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.480]   - Which is a $8 app, I got in the Mac app store.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.040]   - That's right.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:20.880]   - That's right.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.040]   - Which is working with my awesome new Logitech C920.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.360]   - And you're getting everything,
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.640]   it's just looking so good now.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.280]   - Google employee makes,
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.200]   - Looks perfect, thanks.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.080]   - Insanely catchy rap video.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:34.920]   - Ooh.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.680]   - And with product placement for a certain product
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.600]   that I like.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.280]   - So is this an ad?
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.760]   - No, but it's product placement for Leo.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:43.600]   What would Google do?
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.200]   - Pixel, Pixel.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.440]   - No. - No?
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.280]   What?
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.840]   What would Google do?
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:51.200]   - That's what's, I gotta read the book.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.480]   (laughing)
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.240]   Let's go see it and see.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.080]   Watch. - Watch it.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.080]   - And learn.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:02.480]   - Google employee, this is the article, here's the video.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.320]   Let's go full screen, welcome to Google, it says.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.240]   - Okay, give it a second.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.440]   - Okay, patience.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.080]   There's the Google, it's.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.800]   - Sound. - We're not getting audio?
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.960]   Oh, I gotta turn it up.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   Oh, crud.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.800]   Oh, crud, how do I turn it up?
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.240]   You know, this Windows stuff is gonna kill me
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.080]   in one of these days.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.240]   - I get rid of a good, you gotta Chromebook.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.120]   I need a Chromebook.
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:29.800]   I need a Chromebook function all the way up.

[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.600]   (laughing)
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.400]   - Like it would have been, they could have made it funny, right?
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.000]   I mean, they could have,
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.640]   they could have made it like a joke.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.680]   Like, yeah, we're rapping, but you know, we're nerds,
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.800]   and we're all wearing our Google glasses now or something.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.960]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.600]   It just seemed like they were trying to be too serious about it.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.280]   - Yeah, to earn it.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.440]   That was terrible.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.760]   - And failing.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.320]   - That was terrible.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.160]   - I'm sorry.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.200]   - They showed my book twice, I love them.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.480]   (laughing)
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.240]   - See us, us old white guys, we think that rap things
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.600]   going somewhere.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.080]   That's gonna be big someday.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:35.920]   - Oh.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.240]   (laughing)
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.240]   - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.640]   - She was groaning, it's so bad.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.960]   (groaning)
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.680]   - They showed your book, Jeff, but wow, that's wow.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.760]   - You know, I'll tell you what though,
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.320]   I mean, it is, he was putting himself out there.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:54.320]   It may not have worked out, but given the props,
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.600]   you know, he took a risk.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.440]   - He took a risk.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.280]   - He did something different.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.120]   - He failed.
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.640]   - That's okay, you learn from it.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.480]   - Move on.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.120]   - Well, you're showing video, Leo.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.440]   The other video is very charming, but I have on the list there.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.000]   Oh, let me go, let me go.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.160]   - Go back to the list.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.480]   - Oh, it says.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:13.000]   Do you have that vanilla ice?
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.560]   Yeah, it was kind of vanilla ice.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.040]   - It was very vanilla, I see.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:23.200]   See, I screw myself up by closing internet explorer,
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.040]   which by the way, do you notice how much this looks
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.720]   like Chrome now, they've got the tools on the right
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.080]   and everything, I couldn't even tell the difference anymore.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:36.440]   My drive, Twitch shows, this week in Google, rundown.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.740]   Who's on the triangulation this coming up?
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.640]   Oh, Pope Bronson.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.480]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.080]   - He and Ashley Meriwether have a new book.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.200]   What's the book about?
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:54.320]   - The science of winning and losing.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.160]   - It's not. - Pope was a novelist at first,
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.760]   but he's now gone into these studies,
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.240]   they've been studying, he and Ashley Meriwether
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.560]   doing some really interesting stuff.
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:03.840]   So that'll be fun, I'm looking now,
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.400]   where did you put this?
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.560]   Way down.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.480]   - Another Google part that says almost.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.440]   - Video's pulling off.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.360]   - The changelog is so damn long.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.760]   (laughing)
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.840]   - Taking me hours to scroll through the changelog.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.400]   - Sorry.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.200]   - YouTube, blah, Facebook.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.080]   We have any, there we go, here we go.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.680]   Here's an off video.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.360]   - Are you gonna ask it?
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.640]   - One second, honey.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.400]   - Let's get out, please.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.400]   - Okay, okay.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.720]   It's snowing for those who want to know.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.040]   - Google, checks a Coi flight 62.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.320]   - Sequoia flight 62 is canceled.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.000]   (laughing)
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.520]   - That is an off.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.560]   That is awesome.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.080]   Oh.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.960]   - Goose bomb.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.040]   - I hope my flight is canceled.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.640]   That'd be so great.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.320]   - That almost made up for that terrible crap.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.920]   - Yeah, yeah, that was a lot better.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.440]   - That's only shown in your pallet, Gina.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.640]   - I feel restored back to.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.120]   (laughing)
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.320]   - How is cleansing?
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.320]   All right, I want to wrap it up,
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.800]   so are there any other,
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.960]   'cause we got Poe online here,
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.280]   is there any other?
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:18.560]   - Next week, let's talk about Google Glass Technopanic.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560]   I'm gonna write a piece about that,
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.440]   so we'll get to that later.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.280]   - Okay.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.480]   - Oh, that'd be a good piece.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.080]   - Maybe by then I will have my Google Glasses.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:26.920]   - Really?
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.200]   - No, really?
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.520]   No.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.680]   - I have a different type of thing.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.920]   - Leo, have you heard anything?
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.320]   - Not a word.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.440]   - Yeah, me neither.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.640]   You guys see that Andy and Nacho
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.280]   switch is switching to Android?
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.600]   - We talked to poor Andy.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.640]   We talked at length with him on Mac Break Weekly yesterday,
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.200]   and he's now a cost state in the Mac crowd.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.400]   - Yes, I have to watch that episode
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.840]   because I have to tell you,
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.160]   you know, some dude switches mobile operating systems
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.880]   is kind of like, it's a non-story, right?
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.120]   You see, you see these switch articles all the time,
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.360]   but when it's Andy and Nacho,
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.440]   I mean, my job was on the floor yesterday.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.200]   - He is, you know, you can read a three part article
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.760]   he's published on techhive.com,
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.840]   describing what he found, you know,
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.960]   were the final elements that put him over the top.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.360]   We, he and I have always gone back and forth
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.600]   'cause I switched to Android a long time ago.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.520]   And he, what he always said to me is,
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.600]   you know, it's just the fit and finish, the apps,
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.480]   or just not as polished, the fit and finish,
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.320]   I said, "Andy, you could do so much more with Andy."
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.040]   He said, "Yeah, but it just doesn't feel as..."
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.640]   And so finally he said, you know, the functionality
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.080]   has finally reached a level,
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.720]   and the fit and finish has improved enough
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.600]   so that the scales have tipped in the favor.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.160]   And he has three or four examples, you know,
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.880]   different kinds of key boards.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.840]   - Keyboards is huge, he loves swipe.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:40.680]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.120]   - Yeah, it did a great thing on just tech century, right?
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.840]   That he spends lots of time doing tech century
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.200]   and it's just easier on Android.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.720]   - The integrated ability to share,
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:51.680]   to anywhere, anytime, and a new app can always add itself
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.840]   to that share menu, which is Apple controls the share menu
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.960]   and very tightly on iOS.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.880]   And in fact, I think it's a subclass of a larger class,
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.120]   which is that Apple locks companies out of things
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.760]   like text messaging, the dialer and all of that stuff,
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.520]   whereas Google and Android allow apps to use it.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:14.120]   And so you get a large variety of much more interesting apps.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.560]   For instance, MightyText, which allows me to use
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.600]   a Chrome plugin to send text messages via my phone,
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.240]   things like that, you can't write text messages on iOS,
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:24.720]   only Apple can write text messages.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.760]   So there's a number of things like that that he says
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.400]   have finally put them over the top.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:33.560]   TechHive.com, and of course, if you really want some fun,
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.680]   read the comments.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.520]   (laughing)
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.360]   - Oh man.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:40.000]   - If you really want to get, but you know, Andy, to me,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.400]   I don't, it is a non-story because any good tech journalist
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:46.480]   is not, if they're doing their job is not going to say,
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.720]   well, I will only use iPhones.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.600]   You got to use what, you know, you got to be open-minded
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.400]   and look at what's out there and use the best
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.480]   and talk about the best.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:57.920]   And I don't, you know, maybe if all he did was,
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.080]   was write about iPhones, it would be reasonable
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.080]   to just stick with an iPhone, but.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.080]   - Right, well, I mean, he was just someone who was just
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:06.920]   a big iOS fan for a long time, well-known sort of,
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.120]   amongst the Mac circles.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.040]   He's not, he hasn't been banned from Mac big weekly.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.800]   - No, of course not, but he still uses a Mac.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.480]   See, this is what I find interesting is that Apple is not iOS
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.520]   and yet people act like it is.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.000]   - Well, when Andy gets a Chromebook,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.680]   that'll be the end of days.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.720]   - Oh, he has one, when he uses it full-time,
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.880]   that'll be the end of days.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.720]   - Yeah, yeah, well, I mean, he's a writer.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.600]   He probably could live on a Chromebook very easily.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.280]   - Absolutely, he likes stripped-down editors.
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.360]   That's all he wants.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.200]   Although when you see Jason Snell stripped down,
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.000]   it's not as exciting as you thought.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.720]   Time Warner Cable says, you know,
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.440]   people don't really want gigabit.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.280]   (laughing)
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.560]   We've done servers. - They're largely
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.000]   fortunate for it, they don't buy it.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.120]   - Yeah, we figured out what the survey was.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.400]   Would you pay $10,000 a month for gigabit ethernet?
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.280]   No way, you see, they don't want gigabit ethernet.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.240]   (laughing)
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.760]   Okay.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:03.680]   - Yeah, that's a whole fiber optic Google experiment.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.040]   - That's a terrible idea.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.040]   - That's a terrible idea.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.840]   - Google and Microsoft top dominate, in fact,
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.520]   the Forbes billionaire list,
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.680]   a number of Googlers making their way
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.920]   onto that list now.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:21.560]   Of course, for years dominated by Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:25.400]   Mark Zuckerberg now, the youngest,
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.040]   and Moskovitz, who's that?
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.960]   Must be a Googler. - From Facebook,
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.520]   yeah, oh, Facebook, okay.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:36.120]   This is the world's richest people.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:39.920]   - Bezos beats the Google Boys by 2 billion.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.400]   - Well, he owns Amazon outright.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.400]   - A larger part of it. - A larger part of it.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.440]   - Yeah, I think that, you know, I was thinking
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.480]   there was another story we had on the run
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:48.680]   on this weekend, I forget what it was, but I--
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:49.920]   - The six tricks?
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:53.080]   - Everybody misses the real war here.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.720]   Everybody thinks it's Apple versus Google.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:55.960]   I don't think it's that at all.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.120]   I think it's Google versus Amazon.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.400]   - Yeah, well, it will be someday, yeah.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.240]   - And Google is now starting its own
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.680]   same day delivery service.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.000]   - Yeah.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.360]   - Everything you go through, that's where the war is.
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.720]   - I'm not sure I want that pixel to come tomorrow.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:16.040]   Bill Gates number two with $67 billion,
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.520]   Amancio Ortega from Spain, he owns Zara.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.120]   Warren Buffett number four, Larry Ellison number five,
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.040]   Charles Koch, one of the Koch brothers.
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.200]   Oh, and there's the other Koch brother,
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.560]   right below him, David Koch.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:32.200]   La Cascing from Hong Kong, $31 billion.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.280]   The Betancourt family, $30 billion.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.800]   You gotta go a little ways, the Walton family,
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.800]   to get to some Google's.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.480]   Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, boy, that pays well.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.120]   He's worth $27 billion.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.600]   It's a good job.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.120]   Sheldon Adelson, that's an interesting story.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.640]   Shelly, the guy who started CES,
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.520]   then became a casino mogul.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.480]   And he's number 15, more Waltons.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:59.960]   Bezos 19 with 25.2 billion.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.360]   Larry Page, $23 billion, 20, and Larry's a little richer,
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.000]   $0.2 billion richer.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   - That's funny, you think, okay,
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.480]   you did a little bit, you realize that's $200 million.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.360]   (laughing)
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.760]   - That's a little teeny bit.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.600]   - I'll take the difference, please.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.880]   - That's the rounding error between them,
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.520]   is $200 million.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.320]   - That's probably awards for being CEO or something, right?
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.320]   2021.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.960]   - Well, one of them by their sold more than $100.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.320]   - Yeah, or the made different investments or something.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.880]   - Yeah, close enough.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.280]   I always like Prince Alwali, Bin Talal, Asalu, Asah,
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.800]   Hwa hahwa, with 20 billion, Carl, I can 20 billion.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.800]   I like this list 'cause it's just you go, wow.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.320]   Wow, these are people who are infinitely wealthy.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:45.160]   The man who owns the Mars Bar fortune,
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:50.160]   Forrest Mars Jr. is a candy billionaire, $17 billion.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:54.800]   All right, what else, six strikes?
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.560]   - Well, no one could down that route.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.040]   - We've talked a lot about it, it became law, but not law.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.880]   - What's new here is that the cable companies
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.600]   say what they're actually gonna do.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.440]   - Right.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:05.280]   - One of them is gonna do nothing,
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:08.240]   one of them is gonna cut you off for some period,
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.040]   one of them is gonna cut you down.
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:10.960]   It's all obnoxious.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.520]   - Yeah, so the idea is every time you're accused
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.200]   of copyright infringement as a strike,
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.720]   by the time you get to strike four or five,
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.240]   most of these companies will at least throttle you.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.140]   Some of them will, I think Comcast will throw up
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:27.880]   a landing page that says until you take re-education,
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:31.040]   our re-education course on piracy,
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.400]   you can't get on the internet.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.320]   And their attitude is, well, this is better than
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.560]   the three strikes law which knocked you off the internet
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.960]   forever, at least we're not proposing that.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.640]   - It's ridiculous.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.600]   - We had Cory doctor on triangulation last week,
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.360]   he said, yeah, but nobody forced them to do this.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.480]   This is their volunteer, they're basically bending over
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.640]   for the recording industry.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.480]   - Yep, yep.
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:59.160]   - And of course you can, not, is illegal to unlock a phone,
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.800]   but thanks to petitions at the White House
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.760]   and several hundred thousand people signed that petition
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.720]   saying it should be legal, the White House has responded
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.120]   and says you're right.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.880]   Now they don't have any, they don't have any right
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.520]   or power to change it, but--
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:15.840]   - They've got a lot of change, but I don't--
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.400]   - They can kind of make a statement here
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.360]   and I think they did.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.000]   Yeah, you're right, you should be able to unlock your phone.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.200]   - I went through my closet and I found some really old phones
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:28.320]   and decided, I just sold a blackjack here for 25 bucks
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.920]   for 30 bucks on eBay.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:33.320]   Right, and I say in my listing it's unlocked.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.280]   - Well that one isn't, but something else is.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.280]   And eBay slashes up a message right now,
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.120]   this is after January 27th, 2013,
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.240]   it is illegal to sell a phone that was not unlocked
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.300]   by the manufacturer or by the phone company.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:49.880]   - Unbelievable.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.280]   Yeah, that's right, that's the new thing, right?
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.480]   They popped that up just to warn you.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.080]   - You cannot sell that phone.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.040]   Although they let you sell it, they just warn you.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.760]   - They just say it's your ass.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.760]   - We're not responsible.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.720]   Let's take a break, come back with our tip tool
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.720]   and number of the week, but I first wanna tell you,
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:09.480]   speaking of phones, did you see that Sprint says now,
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.000]   they're gonna let MVNO's take Sprint devices
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.640]   and bring them over?
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:17.600]   Companies like Teng, this is exciting news.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.680]   Teng's had bringing your own device for a while
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:21.080]   for a limited number, but I think we're gonna see
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.280]   more and more of these.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:25.600]   Teng is a new mobile phone service that, you know,
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.480]   just they're really trying to do it better.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.320]   You save money with Teng, of course, it's really affordable.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.840]   You do only pay for what you use.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.880]   There are no contracts, you're months to months,
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.960]   no termination fees, unlimited devices on a single pool plan,
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.240]   so it's great for a family or small business.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.200]   They resell Sprint, so it is,
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.120]   if you have good Sprint coverage where you are,
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.920]   Teng will be a great choice for you.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:51.720]   You know, a really good example, in fact,
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:55.360]   if you go to twig.ting.com,
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.000]   you can just take a look at the calculator,
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:57.760]   the pricing calculator,
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.680]   bring your current cell phone bill
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.480]   and enter in what you pay right now
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.640]   and you'll see how much you'll save.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.960]   It starts $6 a month per device,
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:07.560]   so, you know, four phones, 24 bucks a month.
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.680]   Then you add in the text messages, the phone minutes,
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.800]   and the bandwidth you want,
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.400]   and you'll see it's an amazingly low price,
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.760]   but here's the beauty part, you use less, they rebate it.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.560]   Literally, they refund you the money.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.480]   You use more, they charge you at the same rate.
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:24.320]   There's no penalty for using more data.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.240]   Just an amazing, and there's no bundling
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.600]   or ride-along services, there's no overage charges,
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.640]   no penalties.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.360]   You get all the things you want,
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:35.440]   including tethering and hotspotting, free,
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:39.480]   three-way calling, call forwarding, no add-on charges,
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.760]   no mysterious line items,
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.000]   and the account control panel is fantastic,
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.080]   so you can really see what's going on with your account.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.120]   Again, great for business.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.000]   Customer support, well, it's from two-castle,
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.440]   you know, it's the best customer support
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.880]   in the world to call 855 Teng for the win.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.280]   Teng, FDW, anytime, between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern,
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.960]   a real person who's empowered to help you,
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.720]   will pick up the phone, they won't put you on hold,
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.120]   they'll take care of you,
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.480]   but they've also got great help at help.ting.com,
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.200]   active customer forums,
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.320]   help ticketing system, lots of video tutorials,
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.080]   startup guides and more.
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.360]   Teng is a great phone service,
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:15.280]   and they help you get started with Teng,
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:17.120]   save $25 on your first device.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.520]   Yeah, they got all the great Android phones,
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.120]   including the Note 2 and all of that,
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.840]   Samsung Galaxy S3.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:25.080]   They'll have the S4 as soon as it's available, I'm sure.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.040]   To $25 off your first device,
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.640]   when you go to Teng, twig, I'm sorry,
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:34.640]   dotting.com, twig.ting.com, I like the Note 2,
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:38.080]   that'd be my pick, but they have the Optimus G2,
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.960]   which is basically the Nexus 4,
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:45.240]   but with LTE, stuff like that.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.000]   Really nice, twig.ting.com,
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.480]   we thank you for their support, great company,
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:53.480]   great service, reinventing mobile phone service.
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:56.240]   Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.280]   So my tip this week is a new Android app.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.440]   We're actually not new, it's an update to an Android app
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.360]   that I really love.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:04.960]   I think it was many, many episodes ago on this show.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.680]   I was saying that I really wanted
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.760]   kind of the Kindle app for podcasts, right?
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.880]   'Cause I've got a bunch of devices,
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.320]   I listen to podcasts a lot,
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.160]   listen to podcasts across my devices,
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.920]   and it would frustrate me when I couldn't remember,
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.600]   you know, what episodes I'd listen to
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.760]   and how far in I'd listen to them.
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.220]   Well, the guys in all about Android,
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.520]   the show that I do on Tuesday nights, Jason and Ron,
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:25.200]   they convinced me to check out Pocketcast,
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.000]   which has the brand new version that dropped.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.280]   Yeah, do you use this?
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.120]   - Oh yeah. - Oh yeah.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.080]   - New version, Pocketcast 4,
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.920]   syncs what you've listened to,
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.320]   and to what point you've listened to it
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:36.200]   across your Android devices.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.360]   This is awesome, right?
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.760]   'Cause I listen to podcasts on my phone,
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:43.680]   on my Nexus 7, really, really, really great app, love it.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.720]   I think, I don't know, I think it's like three bucks
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:46.760]   or something like that.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.600]   - Yeah, I just wanted to face to you.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:51.080]   - Yeah, really, really nice design,
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.160]   just really well done.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.480]   And in fact, just Shifty Jelly,
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.480]   which is the company that makes Pocketcast 4,
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:00.240]   did this great blog post called Why Android First.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:03.440]   They actually released Pocketcast 4 on Android First
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.200]   versus iOS because they said that this app has outsold,
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:09.800]   the Android app outsold, the iOS app five to one,
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.200]   which is kind of an interesting story,
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.360]   not really the story that you hear,
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.520]   you always hear developers saying
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.720]   that things sell better on iOS.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:19.840]   So, Pocketcast 4, I absolutely love it.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.600]   Check it out, if you like podcasts,
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.760]   which you probably do, 'cause you listened to this one.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.520]   (laughing)
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:27.360]   - Very good.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.320]   - And also, I'll admit, it helps that they included
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.400]   all about Android and--
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:33.840]   - Yeah, right on the front there in a big, big, big picture.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.120]   - Quite a few Twitch shows, actually, so.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.480]   - Oh, it should be, absolutely.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:38.640]   - As it should be.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.560]   - As it should be.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:44.480]   Pocketcast for $3.99 at the Play Store Playback.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.360]   - Google.com.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.840]   Your number, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:52.120]   - Ah, let's see, I got a smorgasbord here of them.
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:53.840]   - Give them all of us, give them all.
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.080]   - Well, okay, we do two things.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.800]   Google versus Apple stock prices
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.440]   at the whitest gaps since 2005,
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:02.240]   25 times earnings for Google, 10 times for Apple.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:08.440]   Between that and Annie and Aco switching to Android.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:12.280]   - It's all over for Apple, it's history, they're gone.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.200]   - That's it.
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.560]   - The other interesting number is that 98%
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.480]   of Chinese made smartphones run Android.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.760]   And that has the Chinese government going a little batty.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.440]   But also, I think Google says we got the last laugh, man.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:29.920]   - Well, it's no wonder, I mean, 'cause you can customize it.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.760]   - Exactly.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.720]   - You know, so.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.680]   - Yeah, in fact, I'm surprised that they sell
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.160]   any iPhones in China.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.600]   - Yeah, well, this is a Chinese made.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.920]   - Chinese manufactured for Chinese market.
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:41.960]   - Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.160]   - Well, yeah, there's not gonna be any Chinese.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.800]   - Actually, iPhones are Chinese made,
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:46.880]   but you know what, everything's Chinese.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:47.720]   - Right, right, right.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:48.720]   So sold in China.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.560]   - Sold in China.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:50.400]   Buy Chinese companies.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:51.320]   - Buy Chinese companies, yeah.
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.120]   - Buy us for us.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:54.120]   Yes.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.440]   - Hey, that's it.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.880]   What you could throw on an extra number if you want.
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:02.160]   - Well, Google's cash pile is $48 billion.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:05.160]   Of course, Apple's is 107 times that, yeah.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.920]   - But still $48 billion is a big cash haul.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:09.920]   They spent, what did they say there for Motorola?
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:13.480]   $12.4 billion from Motorola, and that's gone so well.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.160]   So they got a lot more things they can buy.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.080]   - Very cool.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.040]   - Don't know what it will be.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.480]   - What will it be?
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.760]   Google Glass.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:25.240]   - Yeah, this is nice.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.360]   You know, if you do Wolfram Alpha,
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.920]   if you do like Google versus Apple,
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:33.560]   you can get a table of the two compared, stock price,
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.520]   market cap, revenue.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.520]   You can really, this is a good way to see the two.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.480]   You know, for instance, Apple has 72,000 worldwide employees.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.320]   Google just 53,000.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.160]   - Yeah.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:48.280]   - Well, revenue per employee for Apple is 2.2 million
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.720]   compared to 931,000.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:53.960]   Net income shares outstanding.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.880]   Annual, the PDE is a good one.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:56.720]   Yep.
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:01.600]   And no dividend for Google owners,
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.600]   but you could look at fundamentals
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.920]   and then there's a drop down.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:05.600]   You could look at ratios, balance sheet.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.680]   This is a great way to research companies.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.800]   Wolfram Alpha.com.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.480]   - Aaron, did you want to throw in a tool or a tip or?
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:14.400]   - Well, I've got an app actually.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.360]   I didn't realize that Gina was going to do an app.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:18.600]   So this is a little bit more geeky.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.800]   If you, whoop, then you got the way.
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:21.640]   There we go.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.400]   - Ooh, welcome to Star Trek.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.440]   It's an L cars.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.800]   - This is my L cars desktop.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.240]   That's not what I'm going to show though.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.320]   (laughing)
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.080]   - You mean that's your regular desktop?
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.520]   - Yeah, that's my lock screen.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.800]   My lock screen is L cars.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:35.720]   So this is an app called Drive Droid.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.320]   And basically what this does is you load Linux,
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:43.320]   ISO images, boot disks basically onto your Android
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.920]   and then you can plug in your Android via USB
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.040]   to a computer and boot any of these images.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.360]   You just select one. - Wow.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.400]   - And so you know, like usually you're carrying around
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:54.560]   little USB sticks or-- - You've got five distros
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.720]   on your phone.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.000]   - Well, these are all important.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.880]   I mean, you can't go without at least fedora
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.520]   Ubuntu 3D SD and partition magic, right?
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.200]   - You know what I'd love to have is a pixel
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.600]   that could boot to free BSD.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.680]   That would be the big one. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.680]   - You're so laris.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.280]   - Yeah, you could do either of those, I'm sure.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.120]   - I'm sure.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.360]   (laughing)
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.960]   - So I will-- - I have five distros
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:15.920]   on my phone, which would you like to boot to do?
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.320]   - Yeah, take your pick.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.680]   Spin the way that-- - That's really true.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.520]   - And that's really true in the phone
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.680]   because giant USB-- - Exactly,
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:21.800]   it's like a giant USB drive.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.400]   What it does is it mounts these images
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.440]   so that it looks just like a USB disk--
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:27.680]   - They have to be live drives.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.920]   - Yeah, they have to be, yeah.
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.280]   But it's great for troubleshooting the,
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:34.240]   I don't know how sleetaz or slightaz.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.480]   - What is that? - It's only,
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.000]   it's basically a really, really slim down version of Linux.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.360]   It's 35 meg and it comes with things like G-partid
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.720]   so you can fix disk problems and things like that.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.680]   - So this has now become your fix it to cool.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:48.440]   - Exactly, so anybody that has a problem,
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.280]   like, oh, I got a virus on my windows,
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.440]   then it's like just plugging on there.
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.920]   What's P-magic?
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:54.760]   - Partition magic.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:55.600]   - Oh, I love partitioning.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.320]   - If you have disk problems or anything,
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.760]   it's from, it's-- - Is that still
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:36:59.600]   around? - It's just magic.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.480]   - It's easy for years.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.320]   - Yeah, yeah. - That's up to you.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.960]   - Actually, I'm sorry, not partition magic,
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:03.800]   parted magic.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.280]   - Oh, that's the-- - Partid magic.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.800]   So this is the open source version.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.640]   - Partition magic.
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.040]   - Because everything that partition magic did,
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.800]   but it uses parted as opposed to--
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.880]   - So it's an interface departed, basically.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.800]   - Yeah, exactly, yeah, it's a GUI interface.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:17.800]   So-- - I know what you get on there.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:18.640]   Let's just-- - I tried--
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.200]   - I'm stealing all the Iso's.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.720]   - Well, here's the other thing you can do, right?
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.760]   So if you don't see what's on here,
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:25.000]   you can just hit the plus button.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.400]   - You can add other ones?
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.760]   - You can download the image directly.
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.640]   - Drive droid.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.720]   - Yep. - Now this, of course,
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:31.920]   takes up space on your phone.
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.120]   - Not only does it take up space,
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.120]   but it also requires root.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:36.440]   - Okay. - So that's the caveat.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.600]   So you have to be running root.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.440]   So that's why I said it's a little bit more geeky,
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.000]   but they've got all of these--
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.160]   - Oh, yeah, I say geeky.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.720]   - That's not geeky at all, right?
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:46.760]   All of these, you can just do straight Debian,
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.160]   you can do-- - So how much space
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.120]   are you using?
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.640]   - So each one of these is about,
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.320]   I'd say max about 800 megabytes.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:56.160]   - Oh, that's not bad.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.000]   - So it's not bad, but if you only have a--
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.360]   - If you have a 32 gig card in there--
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.160]   - Yeah, you can store it on your SD card, obviously.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.000]   - Yeah, you can store it on the SD card.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.800]   It's just the way that it mounts it on the USB
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.280]   when you hook up the cable.
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.640]   - So-- - Drive droid.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.720]   - Drive droid. - Need root, big deal.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:09.560]   - Yeah. - If you don't have root,
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.680]   I don't know why you're even alive.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:12.680]   - That's right.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.280]   Just use-- - My sentiments exactly.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.120]   (laughing)
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:15.960]   - Why wouldn't you have root?
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.800]   - Why wouldn't you use it?
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.680]   - It doesn't have to be a drive-in-in,
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.880]   or could I have portable chrome on there?
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.600]   - It's been an ISO. - Yeah, it has to be
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.760]   a bootable ISO image.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.360]   That's really the only requirement.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.800]   If it's not one that's in the list of ones you can download,
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.200]   you can actually download it yourself
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.520]   and then put it in on the phone.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:36.520]   You can transfer the image over to the directory on the phone
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:38.320]   and it'll appear in the list. - That's very cool.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.280]   - So it's very helpful.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.880]   If you're someone that does this all day long,
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.800]   goes around and fixes other people's computers or whatever,
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.880]   very, very handy to just carry your phone with you,
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:50.000]   which you have anyway, as opposed to a bootable hard drive
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000]   or a USB drive or something.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.680]   - Stalling it right now. - Yep, cool.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.520]   - Check it out.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.480]   - I guess you could put Ultimate Boot CD for Windows on there.
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.360]   If you have a bootable ISO, yes.
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.520]   - It should work. - Yeah.
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:02.120]   - Yep, now they say and hear that not every ISO image will work,
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:05.760]   but everyone that I've tried has worked fine.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.760]   The other thing to mention is that you may have trouble
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:13.760]   with UFI bootable computers.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.040]   Some of the comments in Google+ when I was talking about this
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.120]   mentioned that, "Oh, I've got a UFI bootle."
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.400]   - Yeah, that's always, but that's a problem for everything.
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:22.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.280]   - Don't buy those.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.400]   By the way, this is one, but don't buy those.
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.840]   Now there's a paid version and a free version.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.040]   - Yep, it adds, it's just adds.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.800]   - Okay, buck 28, worth it.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:35.920]   I'm buying it right now.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:36.760]   - Yep.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.520]   - Installing it right onto this phone right here.
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:39.400]   - Lots of fun.
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.560]   - Well, thank you so much for joining us on this show.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:44.920]   I, it's always fun to do this week in Google,
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.680]   even though we talk about everything,
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.920]   sometimes but Google.
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:53.320]   Jeff Jarvis is our media guru and the author of,
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:56.240]   as you probably know now, "What Would Google Do?"
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.440]   as seen on TV.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:01.040]   And his latest, which is public parts,
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.560]   I'm surprised it didn't hold that up.
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.320]   He's also a professor of journalism
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.080]   to those lucky few at the City University of New York.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.200]   And blogs@buzzmachine.com,
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:15.680]   and I guess I have to say medium.com/at Jeff Jarvis.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.280]   Read the free stuff, the stuff he gives away.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.160]   - I put it on the blog too.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.160]   - Oh, okay, so it doesn't matter.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:24.040]   It's prettier on medium.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:25.360]   - Yeah, but yes.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.680]   (laughing)
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.040]   - I know, that's mean.
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:29.480]   You should just steal their CSS
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:30.400]   and then you don't need them anymore.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:31.240]   - Well, but I'm not your CEO, Jeff.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.480]   - There's no ear here on me.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.320]   - Add money.
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.800]   - Right, support Jeff and read it on Buzzmachine.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.240]   Regine@smarterword.org, that's where she blogs.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:41.760]   She's also the author of "Think Up a Great Twitter
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.600]   Analyzization App."
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.360]   You can find it at thinkup.com.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:49.160]   And thank you, Aaron, for sticking around.
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.840]   Aaron often is seen, in fact, was this morning
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.960]   us lost weekly, our open source.
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.160]   What did you talk about today?
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.280]   - Cake, PHP.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.120]   Oh!
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.840]   - Oh, really interesting if you're into PHP
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:01.760]   and you want a simple way to deploy a PHP framework,
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.120]   cake PHP is the way to go.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.800]   They make it really simple and easy, so.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.800]   - It's like Rails for PHP.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:06.640]   - Exactly.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.480]   - Yeah, that's exactly it.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.320]   - Yeah, that's amazing, right?
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.160]   Yeah, I like cake.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:10.000]   - Yeah, I like cake.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:10.840]   - I love cake.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.920]   - But not that kind.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:13.880]   I like cake milk.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:16.360]   - Well, their existing their annual event,
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.320]   their conference is called Cake Fest.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:19.160]   (laughing)
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.000]   I'm like, I'm there, man.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.320]   - It tracks some of the wrong kinds, though.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.160]   - Right.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.160]   - I show up at the forks.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.720]   (laughing)
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:27.360]   The Pixel has core boot and not UEFI or BIOS,
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.440]   so that means I'll be able to use the Pixel with this.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.280]   - There you go.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:31.400]   - I'm very interested.
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:33.480]   I mean, if I could just dual boot it, that would be awesome.
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:34.360]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.440]   Yep.
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.280]   - Awesome.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:42.840]   And of course, do you still do your other podcast?
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.680]   - I don't really know.
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:44.520]   - No, so I won't mention it.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.880]   - Nah, just follow me @AryanNukam.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:47.960]   - That's the way to do it.
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.360]   - Google+ is great.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.840]   Anywhere else is fine too, but.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:53.640]   - We thank you for watching.

[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:09.800]   at twit.tv/twig and wherever.

[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:20.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:25.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:28.040]   (somber music)
