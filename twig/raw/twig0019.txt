[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.880]   [MUSIC]
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.280]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers the cloud and
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.440]   all things Google-ish is joining us back in her home in San Diego
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.000]   right now at the wonderful Gina Tripati.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.200]   >> Good afternoon.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.640]   >> Back from her travels to the Great Britain, the Great Britain.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.200]   >> The Great Britain.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.600]   >> As opposed to the not so great Britain.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.680]   [LAUGH]
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.000]   And the East Coast.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.080]   I'm doing that because people in Southern California call highways the 101, the 405.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.960]   Do you do that in San Diego or is that just a Los Angelino thing?
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.160]   >> No, that's a San Diego thing and it's taken me a really long time.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.520]   I also, I want to say highway, I don't want to say freeway.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.040]   So it's hard for me to get the five and the freeway, but yeah.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.960]   It's a strange colloquialism that's unique to that area.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.040]   >> It is, it is.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   >> Speaking of strange Jeff Jarvis is also here, the author of what would Google do.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.920]   And he's a professor of journalism at CUNY.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.760]   That's, if you say CUNY, I guess people on the East Coast know what CUNY is, but
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.200]   I don't know.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.520]   >> I don't know what else to know.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.040]   >> Generally known.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.720]   >> People know city college in New York.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.320]   >> Right.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.000]   >> That's part of the system.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600]   We have 250,000 degree seeking students.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.080]   >> Wow.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   >> 500,000 total students.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.600]   >> We have an interesting fourth today.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.640]   Heather Gold is in studio with us.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.600]   >> Hi.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.960]   >> Heather is a comic and a tumbler.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.640]   >> Yep.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.560]   >> What's a tumbler?
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.040]   >> A tumbler is somebody who brings people together and actually-
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.480]   >> A maven, a social maven.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.240]   >> In a way that comics and the cat skills back in the day and the Mel Brooks day,
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   we're hired not just to perform, but also to get everybody at the resort together.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.680]   >> We're the cruise director, like Gopher.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.600]   >> Well, gosh.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.280]   >> No.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.560]   >> You put it that way.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.320]   >> No, Julie.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.480]   >> Julie, not Julie.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.040]   >> Yeah, Julie.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.520]   >> Yeah, Julie.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   >> That's cool.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.040]   >> You were hard, Julie.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.320]   >> I just kept a crush on her.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.360]   >> Oh, she was cute.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.640]   >> What was her name again?
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.320]   >> Me too.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.800]   >> She had a big Coke problem later, I think.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.840]   >> Well, I didn't have the best of taste until I got married.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.720]   >> Hey, chat room.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.640]   Who was Julie?
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.520]   >> Who was Julie?
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.480]   >> Lauren Tues.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.320]   >> Lauren Tues, right?
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.960]   >> Whoa.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.640]   >> Did you know that?
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.160]   >> Of course.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.520]   There's random television questions from the 80s.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.120]   I know them in the 70s.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.160]   That's easy for me.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.040]   This is the value I bring.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.360]   So I've been performing for a while and actually done my share of internet time as part of a team in Apple.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.920]   Usually that helps start with casting.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.880]   That's very thing we're doing.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.440]   >> No kidding.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.040]   >> Long time ago.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.360]   >> At Apple TV in Cupertino.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.680]   >> Yeah, early was QuickTime TV.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.840]   Very early '95, '96, built the first site for Apple.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.600]   Apple's first revenue producing site.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.440]   >> What was that?
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.040]   >> It was called Music Fan.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.040]   It was in a hands-to-face.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.400]   >> Remember that?
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.120]   >> Before Jobs came back when we were supposed to not be doing music.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.920]   So I was part of the music group, but we were like underground.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.480]   >> Because the Beatles would get pissed off, so you couldn't do music.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.680]   >> Yeah, and they didn't have the guts to sort of go big picture.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.040]   >> Right.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.840]   Nothing scarier than a mad yoko.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.200]   I'm telling you, you don't want to tag me.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.120]   >> Yeah, I worked in the film business.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.080]   Anyway, I started performing and a lot of my early audience were geeks and they were funny.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.960]   And so I started thinking what if I didn't write all the jokes and I ran it like open source,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.920]   the object oriented software.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.960]   And so I started trying to figure out a perform with the people who were the so-called audience
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.280]   live.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   So I've been in that 10 years.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   And now when I speak a lot of internet conferences, I talk about the stuff that I learned from
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.240]   performing.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.200]   And I teach people presenting, but mostly un-presenting how to undo stuff in a way that connects
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.880]   people because now the real-time web, the social web is kind of around, caught up to
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.600]   closer to live performance, really the skills you have from live experiences connecting people.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.680]   >> I think you're right.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.880]   That's actually an interesting insight.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.240]   It is kind of now your internet is public.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.400]   You're doing a public performance.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.640]   >> More and more people are doing a people, I think everyone's a performance artist on
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.640]   Twitter.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.640]   The private and public kind of being melded.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.480]   Also, the things that you can't automate so much online are the way you bring people
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.880]   together, the kind of human skills.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.360]   And that's the stuff I'm particularly interested in.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.760]   And I think it will matter more and more, especially when you want to create a conversation
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   or a site or an experience.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.240]   Like how do you make one that makes people really stick around?
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   How do you make a conversation that matters to people?
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.440]   >> Heather's going to do a new show on our network starting January.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   Did we say 14th?
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   >> I think it's 14th.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.440]   >> Tuesdays at seven.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.600]   >> Thursdays at seven PM Pacific, 10 PM Eastern.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.600]   It's called.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   >> Tomo Vision.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.440]   It's got the best in me.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.720]   >> I don't know.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.800]   She's hoping.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.400]   And I'll extend this invitation that one of the other of the guys from Foreigner will
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.440]   donate the music to double vision to be the theme of Tomo.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.440]   >> I love that.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.920]   Me and Kevin Marks and Deb Schultz.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.440]   >> Oh, that's a good cast.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.720]   >> Will be regular and then we'll have all kinds of -- so there's the early -- there's
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.760]   a lot of stuff happening online right now around social business.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.720]   There's a lot of different phrases getting thrown around.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.280]   Social interaction design.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.280]   IDO is playing with it.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   Lots of different designers.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.560]   Lots of different businesses trying to figure out, you know, people are trying to figure
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.880]   out how to Webify Web 2.05 their businesses.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.160]   But there's things moving from hierarchies to networks.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.640]   How do you actually manage experiences that way without being so locked down and tumbling
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.040]   is just a skill set that lots of people have but some could use more of.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.000]   That's a little less telling everyone what to do, more creating conditions for good stuff
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   to happen.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.880]   >> I think starting now we're going to start every show with a list of acquisitions at
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.880]   Google.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   >> Nice.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   >> That's made.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.320]   Because it just seems like they're really on a tear.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   >> What did Google acquire this week?
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   >> Besides the North Pole, we just decided --
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.760]   >> Yeah, we decided they're getting the elves for the -- they're not going to -- they're
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.600]   going to discontinue the whole Santa's workshop thing.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.840]   But they are -- they're looking at the elves for their engineering expertise.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.600]   >> I like the idea of Sergey and Santa.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   >> Etherpad.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.080]   >> It was the big one.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.080]   >> What is Etherpad?
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.000]   >> Gina, real questions that I pass over to you.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.840]   Etherpad is a wonderful collaborative tool whose team is now going to go into wave and
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.080]   they killed Etherpad immediately and pissed off happy Etherpad customers.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.080]   >> Damn.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   That sucks.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.080]   >> Exactly.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.600]   Yeah, it's a collaborative text editor.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.480]   And actually -- and I wasn't a strong -- I wasn't a big user of Etherpad, but it seems
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.880]   to have a very strong geek following.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.400]   >> Is it like sub-etha edit?
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.000]   Is that -- >> It's like sub-etha edit.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.280]   From what I understand, I can't create a new pad now because it's closed.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.680]   But what I understand it was a sub-etha edit, but in the cloud, in the browser, and actually
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.160]   John Resig, who's the lead developer on jQuery, which is an excellent JavaScript framework,
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.200]   he was saying that he was really disappointed because the jQuery team used Etherpad to collaborate,
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   which is pretty interesting.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   So I think it's kind of same idea as wave, but better than wave.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.760]   You could simultaneously -- >> Better than wave?
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.040]   You know, better than wave.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.520]   Can you believe that, Leah?
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520]   >> Can't be.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.120]   >> You know, I love wave, as you know.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.120]   Wrote a book about it.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.120]   I love it so much.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.720]   But some of wave's editing capabilities, like the text editor really could be a lot better.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.520]   I mean, like, for simple things that you expect from a text editor, like you can't control
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   Z.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.600]   You know, if you accidentally cut a paragraph and you can see nothing happens, you can't
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   undo.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:08.240]   So for what I understand, Etherpad was much, much better about that kind of stuff.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.000]   And everybody who used it was saying, "I was on wave and it wasn't nearly as good as
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Etherpad."
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   So this is why they acquired it, right?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I mean, it was for the technology.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.640]   I mean, this is good news for wave users.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.160]   I mean, eventually, assuming that they're going to roll the features in Etherpad into
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.080]   wave, but right now it really sucks.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.960]   And they handled it terribly.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.720]   I mean, it was just like, "Okay, sold, done.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   No more pads."
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   Sold, done, closed.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.160]   I mean, some people had like embedded Etherpad into their blogging tools.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.960]   And as you know, they went to go write a new blog post.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.040]   It was like, "Google bought us, sorry."
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.400]   So there was just no way to, you know, there was just no easing of the transition.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.680]   And the blog post was kind of like, didn't acknowledge its users and didn't really apologize
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.600]   or give a reason or I mean, it was just, it was kind of weird.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.640]   And Marshall Kirkpatrick complained too about the process that's happening now out there
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.280]   that you're a smart engineer.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.280]   You get a job at Google.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.760]   You leave Google, you start a company.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   Your company gets acquired by Google.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.360]   You come back, you work for Google.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.760]   Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   Right, right.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.760]   Sounds like Washington DC in lobbyists.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.520]   It's a revolving door, isn't it?
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.160]   Well, that's, yeah.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.720]   How could Google have handled this better, Gina?
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.040]   Could they have just kept Etherpad up for a little longer or?
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.680]   They could have said, you know, we got bought, yay.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.480]   Thank you for all your support and for using the product.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.680]   And you have four weeks to migrate, you know, to make new pads and edit existing pads for
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.000]   another four weeks.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.160]   And then on that date, you know, that then we're done.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.640]   And you know, have they ever done that with another product before?
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.600]   No, I can't think of a...
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.520]   I was a good question.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.480]   They kept Jikoo up for a long time.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.040]   They went kind of semi-private, but they kept it on.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   Grand Central stay up?
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.040]   Yeah, Grand Central was up for a couple years.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.040]   Grand Central was up for a while and Trans...
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   They just closed it.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.200]   Yeah, they just closed it.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.920]   And a Google notebook, which is basically essentially killed and they're not developing
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.560]   it anymore, but they kept it up and running.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.880]   So I mean, they just could have given users a few weeks.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.920]   I mean, you know, I saw in the comments some people were saying, I was just telling somebody
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.880]   yesterday how great Etherpad was.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   And now I just look dumb.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.520]   Well, no, you don't look dumb.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   You look like Google agreed.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.520]   I got it.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.920]   It's like when you like the band when they're really cool, nobody knows them.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.720]   But then they not only does everybody know them, they just disappear.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.560]   Don't you hate that when that happens?
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.760]   And like you were there first, but now it's like everybody's there.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.760]   My son says that.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.960]   He says, you know, he goes to a Scott concert.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.440]   He says, people don't know how to skank anymore.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   He's only 15.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.720]   He says kids today, they just don't know how to skank.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.080]   We really need some help on skanking.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   You can call Tiger.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.080]   He's pretty good.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.080]   Okay.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.440]   I think I'm gonna have to break out the rimshot for this one.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.000]   I remember seeing Etherpad the first time it was a, I can't remember who did it, but
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.360]   it was a great demo of a guy writing an article.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.880]   Do you remember what that was?
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.960]   Oh, I can't remember, but it was just incredible.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.160]   Because you could watch, you could play it back in real time.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   It was just him editing his article and watch as he developed his ideas.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.600]   And then they would, they would fill out and it was a really fun demo.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   And you're right.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.960]   I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna side with you on this one, Gina.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.120]   I think it is a little bit better, at least certainly a little bit more transparent than
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120]   wave.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.960]   I think people could write on it at once.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   I don't know what the answer is.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   That's your question.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   I'm not sure.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960]   Okay.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.960]   Well, fumble.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.440]   I'm, I'm told to all the people who are on it, they'll get automatic invitations to
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.440]   wave.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.640]   Ah, so you should join every.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.760]   You should probably think there is.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.880]   And that way, hope the Google acquires it so you get an invitation.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.960]   I was, I, this is kind of a big problem.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.680]   I mean, everyone's apprehension about using cloud apps for their data is like what happens
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.880]   if the, if the company just goes away someday.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.320]   And I think that if, you know, if companies could come up with, could be good about making
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.040]   these transitions a little easier and kind of announcing them a little bit ahead of time.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.040]   But that's a good point.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.720]   People would feel less, you know, scared about moving into cloud apps.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:03.120]   I mean, this is a totally, you know, Google's damaged.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.120]   Cloud computing by this behavior.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.640]   In a little, yeah, in a way.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.200]   I mean, now when people say to me, Hey, what if a company just goes away?
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.920]   Why should I start using a product and it just goes away and I can't get my data out?
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.680]   I mean, you can't export your, your, your ether pads and you can't edit existing ether
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.680]   pads.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   You just can't create new ones.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680]   Well, that'd be a expense.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680]   But, but I think you're right.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.560]   You know, that would be the proper way to do this is to have a policy of saying that
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.280]   when we buy something, if it all possible, we are going to migrate your data to the new
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.840]   thing that we bonded for.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.840]   We're going to get the guys from data liberation from the Google page that is kind of designed
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.320]   to be the answer to this.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.520]   Another plan was, look, you know, we'll have this site where our goal is to make it easier
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.400]   for you to get your data in and out of Google products.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.800]   Is that enough of a response?
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.720]   No, because it's not merely the data, is it?
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.360]   It's also, I have an investment in this, in this tool.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.120]   Your data may be the content and maybe your groups and community.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.120]   There you go.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.840]   It may be, you know, it's the functionality.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   It's a lot of things.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   Your contacts.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.080]   I mean, if Twitter aren't down or occurred to me, I'd be like, I couldn't even get in touch
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.080]   with some people.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   I really want to talk to you.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.800]   I mean, I have fewer phone numbers than I used to have and I realized I'd be hosed.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.840]   I mean, I like trust dev and stuff.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.680]   So you know, there's nothing to say.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.080]   They're not going to just go out of business.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.080]   Google isn't going to just one day say we bought Twitter yesterday.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.920]   Bye bye, everyone.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.640]   There would be a howl if that happened.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   Sure.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   But you know, I should put your alone.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.640]   Yeah, because he's so in touch.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.720]   Well, that's the reason to do it, Leo.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.520]   What a stake in A plus K. Any other acquisitions besides etherpad or is that?
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.240]   No, I actually just looked up on the on the wiki list and that's all there is business
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.240]   in November.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.920]   They're starting a dictionary.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   They're starting DNS.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.960]   I'm sure we'll talk about soon, but I don't see any of their acquisitions.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.920]   What's the dictionary?
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.040]   Here it is.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.000]   Where's Google launches his own dictionary?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.320]   Yes, it's just it's just a new page.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.920]   So once or right now, if you type define colon and a word into the Google search box,
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.800]   it would give you dictionary definitions at the top of the search results page.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.280]   And now it's just kind of a dedicated page.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.600]   It's kind of like the movie times just a dedicated page with just definitions.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.760]   So it's kind of like, you know, the Google, you know, the Google dictionary.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.360]   But it's not Google's own content.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   I see it's pushing me to Wikipedia for it.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   It's Princeton.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.760]   Well, it's it various things.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   It looks like it's there.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.760]   I think it's an aggregation of several.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   I looked up defined skank.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   A huff.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.760]   A huff.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   Any substance.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.760]   A picture of Tiger Woods.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.560]   No, no, no, no, no, I love it.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.240]   But if you just put a define in this first, the first suggestion is love.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.040]   Oh, do you mean that's higher?
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.600]   Do you mean love?
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   No.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.800]   When you say skank, do you mean love?
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   Sure you do.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800]   A kind.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.560]   Well, one difference is they used to send to answers.com.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.920]   And now they're sending to a variety.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   It looks like it's a variety.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   Well, not just Princeton.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.320]   I see Wikipedia, World Net Web, Wickshinary.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.480]   So it looks like it's a search.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.520]   You also you also see.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.680]   You could look in different languages like what I looked up skank in French.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.480]   Skank as to group.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.480]   Prezidia de paprock.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:16.680]   Well, I think from the piece I read it, it's a mixture of Princeton, something in Princeton.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.000]   And well, I'm just saying I'm seeing Wikipedia also.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.920]   I have to go back to the piece they bought in the French.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:28.960]   Genera dello skainome dune ballo.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.360]   I don't think skank means the same in other languages.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.640]   The guy from answers.com said, oh, I don't care.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.000]   We don't care because they only drove 5% of our traffic.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.320]   But I don't know that I buy that.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.960]   Did you know that in Spanish, skank is a funny way of saying a skein of yarn?
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   Seriously?
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.160]   That's what Google says and Google wouldn't lie to us.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.160]   It's an amount of yarn.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   Okay.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   Look, I want to do a little survey.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160]   Look, I want to do a little survey.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.160]   Look, I want to do a little survey.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   Look, I want to do a little survey.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.760]   I'm going to play Devorak here in the same.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   Moving on.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   Let's go over with the news man.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   Devorak.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.960]   I object because Devorak would be all over this.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.160]   He would never leave the topic of skank for the entire time.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.560]   Well, let's leave it.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.200]   He even skanked him doll, which he just did.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.640]   Thank you so much, Jeff.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.880]   Let's move on to an ad.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.000]   You're not excited enough.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.320]   Let me mention our friends at Citrix who do the great product go to assist.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.160]   This is a fantastic tool for people who want to help their family and friends.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.120]   I know during the holidays, when you go home, the first thing that happens is, honey, could
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.360]   you look at the computer, it seems to be booting a little slow, like eight minutes to get
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.680]   started and you go look at it and you go, see, with go to assist, you could have been
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.000]   keeping that computer clean and fresh all the time.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.960]   For pros, there's nothing better.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:46.840]   It's using the great Citrix remote access back behind the scenes that is, there's none
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.480]   better, easy to use.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.080]   It does natural, very simple to configure your router.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.280]   You don't have to configure it.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.360]   It just goes right by it.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.800]   It has some features for the IT Pro that support Pro things like eight simultaneous sessions.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.280]   You can start to clean up on one, a scan on another, install on a third and you still
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.120]   have four, five, six, seven, and eight to work on.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.880]   You never, eight sessions, no waiting.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.840]   It allows you to check and find out what operating system is running, what security
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.560]   system software is running in the background.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.680]   Unattended support too, but it's very easy to get a support session started.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.000]   I actually use go to assist a lot with my family.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   You might want to take a look at it.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.760]   Try it free for the next 30 days.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   Get you right through the holidays.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.400]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.120]   I'm serious.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.120]   Get this now.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.440]   Log in to the folks computer just to see how bad it is.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.520]   Then you'll know what tools to bring.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.560]   Anything from any virus scan to a sledgehammer.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.960]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.480]   We thank Citrix so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.640]   There's a cloud product right there.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.880]   11 Chrome extensions.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.880]   That's good news.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.360]   It was seemed like just, yes, last last week that Gina, you were saying Chrome's going
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.360]   to have some extensions.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.680]   Now there's already 11 in the Chrome extensions directory.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.000]   Are they any good?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.880]   I haven't tried any.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.600]   Chrome is totally my stripped down really fast browser.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   You don't want them.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.240]   Yeah, I almost don't want them.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.240]   It's like Firefox.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.560]   The thing is, I'm sure that some of these are pretty good and some of them really do
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.520]   look good, but no one's going to beat Firefox's selection of extensions.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.080]   If I want a browser checked out with extensions, I'm still going to go with Firefox.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.000]   Some of these look pretty good.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.760]   Some of them look pretty useless.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.840]   Yeah, some of them look kind of useless too.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840]   I don't know.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.720]   I really want to see Google pull off a new browser that also is extensible.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.400]   Firefox is slow often because of leaky extensions.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   Right.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.520]   Extensions, yes, exactly right.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.600]   Extensions can ruin in your experience.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.720]   Now, this Chrome extensions.org is not a Google site, we should say.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.360]   It says we are not affiliated or sponsored by Google.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.600]   We're only providing a place to Chrome extension developers to showcase their work.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.200]   You can tell because it has a belly fat add on it.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:12.840]   I don't think it's a very modern, it's not your traditional belly fat add.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.920]   In fact, I would say worth going just to see the unusual belly fat add.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.920]   What is it with?
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.280]   Is it presumed that anybody uses the internet, either needs has belly fat or brown teeth and
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.560]   it's like just kind of, you know, are you going to drink a kai berry or a kai?
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   What are you pronounce?
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   Is that a kai?
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.560]   I don't know.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.720]   Is anybody really clicking any of these ads?
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   I mean, do they?
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   I hope not.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   It's got a torrent.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   You see the ads?
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   I get what I write about in prostate.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   Yes.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   It's delicious.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   Okay.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.360]   I'm not going to do any of those jokes.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   You know what, Jeff?
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.880]   I can't afford my own keywords.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.640]   You know, you do any performing for lesbians and that's it.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.680]   Like you're priced out of your own world.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.840]   So I actually think lesbians are pretty good keyword.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.520]   You can't, I can't afford lesbian.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.960]   I just happen to be one, but I can't afford myself, apparently.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.680]   I think we have a show title.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.720]   The keyword liberation front.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   Yes.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   Free the lesbians.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   Free the keywords.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.960]   Torrent, download your extension.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.480]   No, I don't want to put that on my Chrome.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.720]   I love that it's, I love that Chrome is so simple.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.400]   I stopped using every other browser.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   I love it.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   It's like Twitter.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   Why the ad lists?
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.040]   Like I loved, I went to Twitter for email because it was like simple and fast and everything
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   flowed.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.240]   That was the whole point.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.600]   And now you're going to lose it all.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.860]   Well, I'm not going to add any extensions.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.000]   What extension could they give me that I could possibly want?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.800]   Google Finance adds real time news streams.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   Is this, I don't know.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   What does this mean?
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   You know, I was thinking this, I was going to launch into my hyper personal news stream.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.360]   Oh, no, schtick, stop.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   But I don't think it's that.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.920]   I think it's just really no different from, you know, friend feed.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.080]   Yeah, or, or, or, you know, nearly days of point cast.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   Oh, MG.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.160]   Whatever happened to good old.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.160]   You could say, oh my God.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.960]   I'm allowed to say God.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   You can't say what the.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   I can say God.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.960]   Did I say you couldn't say.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   Yeah, you did.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.240]   Okay, thanks, Dick.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.880]   I only mean it as a nickname for people named Richard.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.440]   But, uh, so, um,
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.520]   Mr. Cheney, point cast, let's, let's just go back to my prostate again.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.520]   I'm.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.120]   Let's just go back in time and remember.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.480]   Point cast.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.720]   The future of the internet.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.720]   I'm going.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.640]   When I saw point cast way back when I worked for the new houses, cutting assed and, and
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   there was some excitement.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.400]   I said, no, I can do that with a refreshing web page.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.680]   I went back to the office and the great developer we had, woman named Janice Abrams,
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.920]   who did this news flash thing that just brought in six AP feeds on a page that refreshed
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.920]   once a minute.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.600]   It was wildly popular.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.800]   It was more popular than anything we ever did with AP packaging.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.080]   It was news in the raw.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.920]   It was streaming.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.600]   So, yeah, I think I was going to get tempted to say this is a big deal from Google, but
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.600]   it's not.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.840]   I decree it's not.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.480]   No, it's just, it's just Ajax, you know, uh, I remember though, uh, when point cast was
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.680]   big that you couldn't use the internet for the first half hour of the morning because
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.400]   everybody would go into the office, turn on their system and point cast would start downloading
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   megabytes.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   Yes.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.400]   Data all at once.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.800]   God, I spent for a little while working for start up named Zing.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   Oh, I'm going to do Zing.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.480]   And all that it did was it was an app that pushed flash between page loads.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.880]   Yes.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.520]   And built content for, although it decided to change what it did every five minutes, which
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.680]   had no control bird, but I mean, I still see that kind of stuff, but you know where I
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   see, I see an elevator's and I see it when I go to a corner store to buy something,
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.280]   they're pushing the news.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.720]   But I mean, I still think that's devil show up and key asks and wherever else.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.640]   But the point cast was silly because your demographic was in the restroom.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   It wasn't there.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.040]   You know, I went to their demo page, which is Google.com/finance.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   That's market news.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.200]   I went there about a minute ago.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   It's still loading.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   I mean, come on.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.120]   That's not, that's not faster.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.080]   Yeah, they need it.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.080]   They need a better.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.080]   I like real time.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.080]   I'm a big fan of real time.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.080]   I think that's great.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.520]   I think friend feed is superb, but if it doesn't load, it's not real time.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.560]   It's kind of like, okay.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.800]   Let's talk about Google Public DNS.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.400]   I actually for a minute wanted to make this my tool of the week.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.160]   Is this Google doing the, what is it?
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.960]   I use a open DNS.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.360]   Yeah, I use open DNS.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.160]   Is that basically what this is, Gina?
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160]   Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:33.680]   So your DNS servers are the servers that figure out what domain name associates with
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.680]   IP address, right?
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:41.480]   So when you go to www.twit.tv, that's actually an IP address of the Twit servers.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480]   But you don't have to remember the numbers.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.280]   You just had to remember the name, but your DNS server resolves those two figures out
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.560]   which is which.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.040]   So Google Public DNS, and so an open DNS, which has been around a lot longer, but Google
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.080]   Public DNS launched this week, is just really fast cache servers.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.840]   A huge Google hosted database of DNS names and IP addresses that go with them.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.200]   And they're saying that using Google Public DNS will make the lookups for websites a
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   lot faster.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:14.520]   Well, and also as a security issue because, uh, bind had a big security flaw.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.520]   And a lot of people who are running DNS servers, including probably your ISP, were very slow
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   to fix it.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.760]   And this was a huge problem.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:27.120]   And I immediately instructed everybody who listens to my shows to start using open DNS
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.560]   because they had, they were using a fixed version of bind.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.000]   And you know, the programs I had seen the test bind found, you know, huge number of
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.520]   servers and clean Comcast is worth word updated.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:44.120]   Now they most for the most part are another advantage to using this is it's easy to remember
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:49.520]   888 or 8844.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.280]   People normally use their ISP's DNS server, right?
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.920]   Unless you've configured it otherwise.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.280]   Yeah, by default, your computer is set to just, you know, use whatever DNS, you know,
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.560]   you're just kind of plugged into, right?
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.520]   I mean, normally people don't go in and set their DNS servers, you know, to a specific
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   IP address.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.960]   But if you use open DNS or Google Public DNS, you set it and it's 888 as you said, which
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.560]   is pretty lucky IP address that they got.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.160]   You know, I don't know.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.160]   It's interesting.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.680]   I wonder if they approached Google approaches, uh, open DNS to buy them.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.960]   And, uh, because it seems like they would want to do that.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.880]   Open DNS has been around for a really long time and open DNS actually offers more options
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.320]   than Google Public DNS does.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.560]   You can set filters, phishing filters, you can set parental controls.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.920]   You can make kind of changes, um, to what you use it for parental controls.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   And it's very effective.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920]   Mm hmm.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.320]   And you can't do that stuff with public Google Public DNS.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.520]   And another thing is they're missing out on a revenue opportunity because one of the
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:46.800]   things open DNS does, if you mistype a URL, you get a special search page and some ISPs
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   do this too.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.280]   And it's, you know, I've very assigned tried to do it.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.520]   People got upset by it that has, you know, oh, did you mean this and some advertised
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.520]   links?
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.400]   You'd think that'd be the reason Google wanted to do this, but I just entered in a random
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.760]   address and it gave me the standard of, you know, Firefox error message.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.760]   It didn't replace it with a Google DNS page.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   David, uh, a little bit.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.760]   It's the bomb.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:13.680]   I just want to say I really like he has a letter on open DNS about this trying to be
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.840]   somewhat respectful, but he says that Google claims that it's better because it has no
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.000]   ads or redirection that he says.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.240]   Remember that the Google is also the largest advertising redirection company on the internet.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.240]   Right.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:30.280]   I think the Google DNS services for the benefit of the internet would be naive.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.880]   So you got a little pissy there.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.840]   It's, you know, it's kind of thing that end users don't really understand.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.080]   But when somebody owns your DNS server, they do kind of own your experience of the internet.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.400]   I don't see anything going on with Google that would make me nervous about it at this
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.080]   point, but they, I agree.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.600]   But, but, but is there kind of an end to end thing starting here where you have a Google
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.240]   OS, a Google browser, Google DNS, Google search.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.000]   Trying to become like Apple of the internet.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.440]   And you know, it's optionalized as Eric Schmidt will always say there is always a very good
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.320]   competitor for every one of our services and you, you can use it and we'll, we'll
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.080]   help you get your data out and you're not with us.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.040]   But if you go the Google way, hip, you get special extra.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.040]   Prizes.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.280]   That's what Steve Jobs says all the time.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.920]   I want some special extra prizes.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.840]   You know, I have to say, I don't know David and I'm sure he's the bomb.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.520]   Well, he's a big supporter of the Heather Gold show.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   Okay.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   And a lovely guy.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   And I recommend.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.120]   But I have to say I'm reading this article and it's just kind of.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.120]   He's a smart guy.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.000]   I mean, it's like, well, they're not us.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.160]   He's basically his, basically his response, but they're not us.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.160]   Yeah, but they're not going to be.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.440]   Anytime you're small and you've created something and somebody huge comes into you.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.640]   Welcome to the real world.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.640]   You know, NBC could start doing twit.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.640]   Yes.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   And I invite them to.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.640]   And you're not going to say they're not.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.640]   You'll say the same thing.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.640]   They're not you.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.640]   Maybe I would.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.640]   Do you think I would?
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.400]   I would write an article saying, let me tell you why NBC stock you are already an article.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.240]   Come on the air or whatever.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   Fuck.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.400]   It's not fifth.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.080]   It's not clear that internet users really want Google to keep control over so much more
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.000]   of their internet experience than they do already from Chrome OS at the bottom of the
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.960]   stack to Google search at the top is exactly what you were talking about, Jeff.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:19.240]   And yeah, and Heather from it is becoming an end to end infrastructure all run by Google,
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   the largest advertising company in the world.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:26.440]   I prefer had a Regenius internet with lots of parties collaborating to make this thing
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.440]   work.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.440]   I'm with him on that.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.000]   I mean, I guess that's the mono culture argument, right?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.680]   Why would Google have felt this was a necessity?
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.320]   Yeah, I mean, this is this is the question.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   Why are they doing this?
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   I mean, Jeff is right.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.800]   I don't know what you're referring to, but I'll take it.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.200]   You said end to end.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   I mean, why else?
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.440]   Why else?
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.760]   End to end.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.520]   And the users, Internet experience.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.640]   I mean, they're going to have a lot of data about where.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.640]   Ownage.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   The Rids are reason.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   Ownage rhymes with pony.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.640]   I'm the word.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.800]   Just try to make it entertaining, guys.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.880]   That's what I have the crickets for.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   All right.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.720]   So Gina, go there for a second.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:18.760]   So no, but you have to say, if they own more data, then they in fact have if they own DNS
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.080]   or a good portion of it, they have much, much, much more data about traffic generally
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   around the Internet.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.720]   They know as much as your eyes.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   They know as much as your eyes.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   Peenos, right?
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.720]   Okay, right.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   Right.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.800]   Bingo, there's the value.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.680]   And if they motivate you to do it because they offer you free Wi-Fi, we should only wish.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   A no s.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   A no s.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.680]   A no s.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   A no s.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   Watch it.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   Watch it.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   Your number could be somewhere in here.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   Nope.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.680]   I'm, I'm thinking of a number between one and infinity.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   I dare you to come up with it this week.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.320]   I dare you.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.920]   Very inside.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.240]   You had to listen to last week's show.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.640]   So Carmack, the magician.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.840]   Did you take the test your Google IQ quiz?
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.640]   Let's do that in a minute.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.800]   Test your, you guys know Google, right?
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.800]   CNBC.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   I did.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.960]   Did you watch the CNBC special?
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:14.680]   I meant to watch it because, you know, I mean CNBC did a special on Google.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.960]   I saw commercial for it in an airport at some point in my travels and was just like,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.120]   Oh, that looks so good.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.120]   And I didn't get to see it.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.120]   Did you see a Leo?
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.120]   I forgot.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   God, I'm embarrassed.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   I forgot to.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.520]   It's called inside the mind of Google.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.360]   I'm sure we can find the mind of Google.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.120]   Like there, it sounds a little bizarre.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.800]   It's also like it's a guy.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.640]   You can't do that.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.200]   Sorry, Dave.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.320]   It's Maria Bartiromo.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.320]   So I don't know.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.320]   I'm not.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   Maria Bartiromo.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.520]   I think she's the best teacher for this.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.520]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.160]   I'm going to, you know, I should have watched it.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.760]   But I for some reason, my only wife.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.160]   Subscribe from the word Google, which means you're taking the quiz.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   A German variation on nine pin bowling.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   Yes, of course.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.160]   Everybody knows that.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.240]   It happened to us.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   Is this day?
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.440]   This is for people who are not listening to this show.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.160]   These are people who don't use Google.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   Come on.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   I tend to think that that special was probably for people who don't listen to this show as
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.160]   well.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.200]   How much users generated data does Google process each hour?
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.400]   One gigabyte, one petabyte, one terabyte, one infabyte.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.400]   Infabyte.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.560]   Isn't Maria Bartiromo is the one who didn't get the year to be 65 before you could go
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.560]   on Medicare.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.040]   So I don't know if I trust her reporting.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.840]   I'm sure she has people who write the content as I do.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.840]   As you do it.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.840]   As I do.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.840]   So wait a minute.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.840]   It's a mathematical term.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   Okay.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.840]   Okay.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.840]   That's a question.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   Okay.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   Pedabyte.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.840]   I'm trying to catch up with you.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.840]   Okay.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.840]   How much users generated a petabyte an hour?
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.840]   Holy komoly.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.840]   You didn't have to do that.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.840]   Infabyte we like though.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.840]   I think I would have wished an intro.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.840]   Infinibite.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.840]   Infinibite.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   Incorporate model.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.040]   All motto.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.440]   All competition must be crushed.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.440]   Don't be evil.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   Property is theft.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   I like that.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.240]   I'm voting for property is theft.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.720]   Because that's my motto.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.880]   We make money the old fashioned way we earn it.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   No, it's everybody.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.280]   I don't remember whose motto that is.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   Probably do.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.280]   Yeah, because it was John.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.000]   It was John Hausmann who said we make money.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   The old fashioned way.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   It's Barney.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   It's Barney.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   We earn it.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   It's Barney.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   It's the law of law.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   It's Barney.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Who knows?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   We make it the old fashioned way.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   We steal it.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.120]   We steal it like all good wasps.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.520]   Which religious figure received his own channel after Google?
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.240]   I would say.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.760]   The video website YouTube was at Bishop Thomas Mootie, Pat Robertson, Pope Benedict VI or Rabbi
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   Schmulie Boetek.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.120]   I'm going to hope it's the Pope.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.120]   It's got to be the Pope.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.120]   It's the Pope.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.120]   But I've been told that.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.120]   Is there a Rabbi Schmulie Boetich?
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.960]   Oh, there has to be.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.960]   Schmulie.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.960]   Jat room.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.160]   Schmulie, Mr. Tumbler.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   Mr. Tumbler?
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.480]   He is really a problem for me as a Jew.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   We don't have excification.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.480]   Schmulie is?
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.480]   But I have to tell you.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.480]   I know who he is.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.480]   I'm into open source religion.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.480]   I do know who he is.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.480]   And I think we should borrow from other religions.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.560]   And I think we should borrow from the Catholics next communique, Schmulie.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.280]   And Woody Allen, by the way.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   He's a self-loathing?
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.120]   He's like a self-appointed rabbi.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   He's just your Michael Jackson.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.480]   You're after Michael Jackson died and came out with a book.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.640]   I have the inside scoop.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.280]   I'm his spiritual teacher.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   He's just--
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   Wait a minute, though.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   He's a--
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.280]   He's America's Rabbi.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   Right.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   It says so on his web page.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   That's right.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   He is.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   He's a self-promoting Jew.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   His name is Schmulie.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   He is.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   He wouldn't be the first.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.280]   He has a channel.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.280]   He does.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   He's a Rabbi Schmulie.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   You're supposed to turn people away three times.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   It's a little way Apple used to be.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   You don't want to be a Jew.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   Apple is like the Jews.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.280]   It's a lot of work.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.280]   Go there now.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   The leaves.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.280]   He's a lot of kosher.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:03.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:13.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:30.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:40.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:45.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:50.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:37.280]   You don't want to be a kosher.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   You've taken this quiz, Jeff.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   Jeff, I would assume that the author of what would
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:37:01.280]   be the first time you would have to be a kosher.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.280]   You're missing the ads.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   This is a correct new question.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:20.280]   I'm going to say that if they had an ad on the homepage,
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   it would be worth millions in Carl's second land.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   We're going to guess D more than $100 million.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   The answer is that your final answer is correct.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   By passing search results page, Heather, you win.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   It's possible to become too dry, too corporate, too much about making money.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.280]   I think that's what's delightful about I'm feeling lucky.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:53.280]   We call it the delightful button at the Google Flex.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   Well, you know who doesn't want to feel lucky?
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.280]   Yeah, I'm feeling lucky.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.280]   I like the I'm feeling lucky.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.280]   You know, if you type "twit" and press "I'm feeling lucky,"
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.280]   you win.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.280]   I'm the number one "twit."
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   That's nice.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   Isn't that good?
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   I think this is insurance against them being accused of being evil.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   We're not evil.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   Look.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   We have an "I'm feeling lucky" button that makes you not evil.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.280]   Look, we're leaving so much money on the table.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.280]   No, I think you're right about that.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   They're trying not to be too greedy.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.280]   I just put into it and press "I'm feeling lucky" and I got this.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   The "I'm feeling lucky" TM button automatically takes you.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.280]   It's an explanation for the "I'm feeling lucky."
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   It explained it, yet it did not take me to it.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   That's bizarre.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.280]   Maybe it's just me for me, especially.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   I don't know.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   Maybe they're watching us right now.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   I'm sorry, you're too stupid to use the "I'm feeling lucky" button.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.280]   You might want to try the "I'm feeling delightful" button instead.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   Nice.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   I'm feeling excited.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.280]   Mine says "No, you're not."
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   [laughter]
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.280]   I should have an "I'm feeling unlucky" button that only pulls you to spam.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   That would be kind of...
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   It's a random age.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   Just random.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.280]   You're going to explore.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   That's how we have discovery.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   They won't just be a search company.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   They'll be a discovery company.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   I'm an "I'm lucky" button.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   Do that.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   Discovery.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   That's what they need.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.280]   They need to...
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   Well, that's the whole competition, right?
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280]   The Twitter?
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.280]   Right.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.280]   Discovery versus Search.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.280]   I think the whole...
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.280]   I like OAM's phrase, "Social OS."
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.880]   I do think the social operating system of the people who use the web are definitely going
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.880]   to be the...
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.280]   I won't call it competition, but the more relevant way to find stuff other than through
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   an ad and a search.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:33.240]   In August 2005, Google sold 14 plus million shares of its stock.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.240]   That is the significance.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.680]   Oh, you have to give you the whole number.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.640]   I actually, if I give you the number, you'll know.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.640]   14159265.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   I won't know, but I...
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   All you have to do is...
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   Mathematicians would know.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   It's a Matthew thing.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   It's a pie.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.640]   It's a pie without the three.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.640]   That's pie.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.640]   Well, there's no three.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   It's through me.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.640]   I'm not as nerdy as you guys in the whole way.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.640]   Not fair.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.240]   Did you know, Jeff?
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   No.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   Yeah, you were.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.040]   So just Gina and I knew.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040]   We knew.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.040]   We were looking pie to me.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.040]   I was like, "Oh, pie, but weird."
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.040]   It's pie.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   3.15 is pie.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.760]   You know how you remember that?
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.040]   Oh, how I want to drink alcoholic, of course, after the...
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.760]   Oh, how I want to drink alcoholic, of course, after the heavy chapters on quantum mechanics.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   Wow.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   Which of the fuck...
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   Wow.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.400]   I have a student who got a physics degree and he has pie tattooed on his arm.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.000]   Now that's a good tattoo.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   That's cool.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   That is cool.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   That I would do.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   I went to the law school and people there tattooed their GPA and their arm.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   So I'm not...
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.160]   Did you really go to law school?
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.160]   I did.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.920]   Did you take the bar?
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   I took it.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   Didn't pass it.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   I did not and I'm very proud of that now.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.920]   Years later.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   I'm feeling lucky.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.920]   I'm feeling now.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   Who's feeling lucky?
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.920]   I'm feeling lucky.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.920]   You can't be disbarred.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:49.920]   You can't be...
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   You can't be disbarred.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.360]   The only thing you get when you pass the bar is that you can be worried about losing
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   it.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.160]   You can't be disbarred if you have never been barred.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.160]   That's right.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.160]   It's a joy.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.160]   And you know what?
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.800]   Every startup I worked with loved everything about that.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.240]   I was like, "Yes, I'll write a contract for you.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.480]   It'll be a page long and it will be practical."
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.480]   It was good.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.360]   So in your early days you got gigs as an unbarred lawyer?
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.400]   I did biz dev so I did deals.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.400]   So you knew what a contract looked like?
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.240]   I would send a contract to the lawyer but I would write it first and try to make it short
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.160]   and in English and then they tried to lawyer it up.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.160]   No wonder you never got barred.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.760]   And then I'd revise it to make it English like again.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.280]   I can't make you put you in the fraternity.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.760]   I'm not about joining the fraternities really other than just the general geeky fraternity
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.520]   of the human race and love.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.520]   Shut up.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:39.960]   Which of the following services was actually an April Fool's Day hoax perpetrated by Google?
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.560]   Was it Google caffeine?
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.560]   Google mail?
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.240]   Google toilet internet service provider or TISP or iGoogle.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.640]   I think this is pretty obvious.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.920]   I'm going to have to say a TISP and that's correct.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.320]   You know Google mail is on that list because Gmail launched on April 1st.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.320]   Right.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   Oh, that's kind of a nice.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.320]   You know that?
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.480]   Yeah, no, that's kind of a nice little.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.200]   People were like, are they serious?
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   That's a good little insight.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.360]   That's a great trivial process.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.800]   I think Paul Boohike has said that a few times and that people he had to like say, no,
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.880]   no, really, we're really doing it.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.440]   It's not a joke.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.240]   Inside the mind of Google.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:19.080]   Well, thank you for joining us for this special edition of Inside the Mind of Google Meets.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.440]   I want to be a Google name.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.160]   I'm Maria Varturamo and I use Google.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.960]   So I'm here to happily tell you about its mind.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.480]   Did you know if you put your search query in quotes?
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.480]   Everything will happen.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.960]   Let's take a break.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.120]   I want to tell you a little bit about my car and then we will continue on with more news
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:41.160]   and of course, Gina's tip of the week, my tool of the week and Jeff's number of the
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.320]   week before we do that though.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.760]   I want to mention Ford is sync.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.200]   Ford is a course, a sponsor of the show.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:54.200]   Sync is their computer in a car that is mind boggling after the show.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.000]   I'm going to take you out in my Mustang and you can take a look at Ford's sync.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.920]   I was playing with it today.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.480]   You press the button and you still have the whole idea is you don't take your eyes off
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:06.080]   the road, your hands off the wheel, you're safety first, but you control everything with
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   this button.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.280]   So you push the button.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.480]   You don't believe it either, do you?
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   No, I don't.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.480]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.280]   This is a pretend thing you're making up.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.120]   If I were, let me put it this way.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.120]   If Ford's sync didn't exist, we would have had to invent it.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.360]   You push the button on the wheel, it goes, "Don't," because I have it in advanced mode.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.120]   You can have voice prompts, but I don't like to be told what to do.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.800]   It goes, "Donk," and I'll give you an example.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.040]   I'll say audio.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   "Donk," sync.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.240]   Play this week in Google 19.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.000]   It starts playing.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.400]   I say, "Play next," it plays 20.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.360]   I say, "Play previous," it plays 18.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.640]   I say, "Play similar," it plays other podcasts.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.000]   I say, "Play genre podcast," it plays a podcast.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I say, "Play NPR," it plays a press share.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.400]   I mean, it's like it knows what I want.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.640]   What does it say if you say, "I'm feel lucky."
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.640]   [laughter]
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.640]   Punk.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.640]   Punk.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:01.360]   It works with your phone, works with up to 25 different phones.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.840]   If you're like Gina and me and you collect cell phones, it works with my Android, it
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.840]   works with my iPhone.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.240]   I'm getting the Nokia 900 on Tuesday.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.840]   You just say, "Dile, Gina."
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.840]   I call Gina.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.920]   Yeah, call Gina Trapani.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.160]   I have to do the last name because I know 15 Genas.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.160]   It happens to be a favorite.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.120]   I hear you're from East Coast, yeah.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   Hey, Gina.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.520]   No, I think if I could say, "Call Gina," it would call Gina.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.800]   Call Heather, you're the only one without an E, so I'd say, "Call Heather without an
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.360]   E," and it would find you.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.360]   That's pretty incredible.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.960]   You can say, "No, no."
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.360]   Okay, I'm exaggerating a little bit.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:39.320]   You can't say, "Call Heather without an E." It's not like there's a person in the computer.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.880]   There's a bunch of little elves in there.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.520]   They're going, "Heather without an E, let's go through this Rolodex.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.520]   See if we can find that."
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.320]   It must be out of here somewhere.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.360]   He would have said it if he had to mean it.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.120]   It's got a 411 business search, so you could say, "Navigation Starbucks."
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.120]   You'll find it for you.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.120]   You can call it.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.600]   Vehicle health report, this is cool.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.720]   You can say, "What's my oil pressure?
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.720]   What's my oil system?
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.720]   How's my drivetrain?"
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:07.200]   911 assist, so if your airbags deploy, it calls 911, feeds in the GPS coordinates, and
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.280]   then lets you take over.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.120]   Have you had your airbags deploy ever?
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.120]   Thankfully no.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.120]   It's a terrifying thing.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.360]   Is it hurt?
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.440]   You know what's worse, and this happened to me.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.480]   You have a head-on collision and your airbags don't deploy.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.080]   Yeah, that would be bad.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.080]   That's not good.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.080]   I wouldn't want that.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.320]   I was going five miles an hour, so it wasn't like it was a death-defying collision.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.320]   But I'm thinking, "Here I am.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   I'm sitting.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.440]   I just bashed into a car, and my whole front end is crumpled, and the airbags did not
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.440]   deploy all this time.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.560]   I've been driving this wasn't a Ford, I could tell you right now.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.160]   This piece of crap car, and it was lying to me.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.560]   It has no airbags.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   The top back.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   The top back.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.560]   The top back.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   The top back.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   The top back.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.560]   The top back.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.560]   The top back.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   The top back.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.560]   The top back.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.560]   The top back.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.560]   Said that they only deploy over 33 miles.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   It does.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.280]   There's a nice lady in there.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.120]   You can say, "Yeah, actually, you know what you can do?
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.960]   You can say, "I want personalized news, sports, whether it read your sports course, I'll
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   tell you the weather.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:02.960]   You can say five-day forecast.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.080]   I'll give you the five-day forecast."
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.760]   It has GPS built into it, so you don't need to buy the GPS system.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.000]   I can go on and on, and I think I have.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.200]   But the best thing to do is go to SyncMyRidepodcast.com.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.360]   SyncMyRidepodcast.com.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.800]   You can learn more and how you can win a nano or zoom.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:24.880]   You know, Ford has a social media guy, a very high-level guy, Scott Monty, who runs their
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.880]   social media strategy.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.800]   They were doing a thing where they were giving away a certain number because I know a bunch
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.320]   of vloggers who were doing this for us.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.600]   We're giving away 15 nano's and zoons.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.440]   If you go to SyncMyRide podcast, you can see how to tweet to win, but it's only through
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.800]   December 9th, so it's just a few more days left.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:45.720]   What you do is you say, "Hey, listening to Heather, Gina, and Jeff on Twig, and you put
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.000]   the #pound SyncMyRidepodcast," and then you're automatically in the drawing.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.880]   They're giving away 15 nano's, 15 zoons through December 9th.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.200]   There's your chance to win.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.760]   We thank Ford for their support, and next time you heard of Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer,
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.160]   just do yourself a favor.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.120]   By the way, and this is not part of the ad because the ads really for Ford Sync, Ford
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:09.400]   was the only US motor company, big one, one of the big three, not to take money from
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.560]   the government.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.600]   Their car quality amazing.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.160]   I would say it was for that.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.120]   Five years ago, I would not have driven a Ford.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.120]   You get in this Mustang.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.480]   It's solid.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.200]   The reliability very high.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.880]   Yeah, thank you, Ford, for running your business well.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.880]   Amazing.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.880]   It's so fun.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.240]   I used to drive a Buick Regal a long time ago and someone told me it was the other time
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.440]   the most popular American car.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.120]   I was like, "Yeah, I've driven an American car a long time."
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.680]   The Buick is the doctor's car.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.680]   Did you know that?
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.680]   Really?
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.680]   Every badge.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   Jeff probably knows this.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.320]   Every badge has a personality that...
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.320]   Batch.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.320]   Okay.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:46.520]   So they have this GM or it's four, but then there's a badge like Lincoln, Mercury, Buick.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.400]   The product name.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.800]   Back in the day, they would say, "Okay, we're going to make a car for doctors."
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   That's the Buick.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.760]   That was their early brand research.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.760]   I think that's a lot of stuff.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   Foldsmobile.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.760]   Heather, I cannot see you in a Buick.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   I know.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   I know.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.760]   I know.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.760]   I was like, "Oh, I'm on this car.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.760]   It was huge.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   I took a few.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   Or Tiger Woods for that matter, too.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.760]   I drove this Buick Regal and it was humongous.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.760]   It was the size of this room.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   It was the floor trouble.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.760]   Nothing would happen to you.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   Oh, it's great.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   And bench seats.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.760]   So you're like sitting on yourself.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.760]   It was.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.640]   And if you turn too hard, you'll slide all the way to the left.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.280]   And the engine, I like four parts in it.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   It was a very old carbon.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.280]   It lasted a long time.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.280]   And when I used to take it in Boston to get it fixed, they'd be like, "Thank you.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   There's no computer."
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   It's so easy.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   It just like...
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   I mean, it lasted a long time.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.280]   A cab did once hit me and the front fell off the cab.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.280]   Nothing happened.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.280]   That's saying something.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   Those checker cabs.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.280]   They're tough.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   I know.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.280]   Well, he was feeding.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   The whole front is up.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.360]   And I barely felt it because this thing was so long.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.600]   Did I just run over a bird?
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   What happened?
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.600]   There was a bump.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   Did you hear that?
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   Nah.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   Keep going.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   It's there.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.600]   So wait a minute.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   Tiger was doing an endorsement for Buick.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   He was, I think, as a matter of...
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   But he was driving...
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.800]   Let's say he was because, you know, not so all American anymore.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.600]   That's such a good driver anymore.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.000]   And his wife, we hear, she can drive.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Wouldn't you really...
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   With a driver.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   That's right.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   But, wait a minute.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Well done.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   If I had the instant rim shot, I could play a...
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Yeah, you did one of those.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.200]   Can we get one for beautiful?
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.200]   Asking each show received.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.400]   The internet is an amazing place.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.800]   All you have to do is say instant rim shot.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   There it is.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   That's like the Ford Sing.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.800]   Oh, Jeff.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   Is that a chambon?
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   That's said chambon.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.800]   This is the...
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   Craig Newmark gave me to the...
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   Oh, that's used to the rim shot app on my iPhone.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   I'm getting that.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.800]   What's the name of the app?
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.800]   It's...
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   What's...
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   Okay, this is now officially the worst version.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   I'm so happy.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   The worst twig.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   The worst?
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   We're having such a good time.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   It's a fun twig.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   How many people are going to go download instant rim shot?
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   Like, a lot.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   What's the name of the...
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   The app?
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   I'm just kidding.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   Someone just put it in your instant rim shot.com.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.800]   Well, it's rim shot.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   It's said the name is too long.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   It's rim shot something.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   Well, if you search, I think if you search iTunes for rim shot.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   It's just jumps to the twigs.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   Rimschon and Trumbo.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.800]   It's Tomo.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.800]   Yes, it kind of has.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   Twig has not jumped the shark.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   The shark has jumped twig.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   I didn't know I could do this.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   New version.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   You can set your shake sound.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   So you can just shake it and there it goes.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   Nice.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   I'm so happy.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   Is there a Moroccan thing where you just go...
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   That would be handy.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   Like, let it...
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   Like, you just jump into a...
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   Gina, you got to write something like this for Android quick.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   Yes, obviously.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   Oh my God.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   Can we talk about the Droid ad?
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   Are we...
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   That's Google related.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   Are we still too fluffy for you guys?
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   No, no.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   We've talked about the Dread ad before.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.800]   It's a little scary.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   What?
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   WTF.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.800]   Can I say that?
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   Why?
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   What ad agency did they hire?
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   It's the standard.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   The whole Droid positioning is very bizarre.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   Because when you turn it on, you get the red eye of Mordor, which is...
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   I don't know.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.800]   It's not what I'm looking for in a cell phone.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.800]   I'm looking for not being on AT&T.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   That's the number one thing I'm looking for.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.800]   Well, you can get that.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   That's all you have to do to sell them.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   That's what they offer.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   They offer that.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   Why isn't that the ad?
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   Just start with that.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.800]   You're playing with this.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   Have you played with one?
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   Do you like...
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   I saw it on the other day and I was a little jealous.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   I kind of like it.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   I'm kind of almost...
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:15.800]   I'm tempted to be.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   You know what?
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.800]   I don't like this number at the top.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   I don't know if you can...
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   What's the number at the top?
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.800]   A little number.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   Meaning there's like 12 icons.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   I'm already overwhelmed.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   That's actually a good system.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   Now, you push it and you drag it down.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   The window shade is the best.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   Why can't I just have that pull down thing?
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   I love the window shade without the little scoobies at the top.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.800]   Because that tells you you've got something.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   You just have the clear notifications button.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   Yeah, those all each means...
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   I can get rid of that.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   Each of them means something.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   They mean you've got a text, you've got an email, you've got...
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   The resolution.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   You know, Kevin Marks was showing me that resolution is so gorgeous.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   That's really where it was.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   But he wasn't happy with the keyboard.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   No, it's a useless keyboard.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   In fact, my recommendation is soon as they start, they put a clear 2.0 on the
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   aris, which I'm told by my Verizon contacts, they are going to do
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   imminently.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:04.800]   Once they put a clear on the aris, that's the one to get because that
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   doesn't have a slide on keyboard, so it's thinner and lighter.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.800]   But it's otherwise comparable.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   You know what I just saw an app by what's his name?
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:12.800]   VisiCalc.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:13.800]   Dan Brooklyn.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:14.800]   Did you guys see this?
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.800]   It was Jeff.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   Did you know on the tweet of this out?
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   It's a beautiful...
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   It's on the iPhone.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.800]   Maybe it'll work on Android to eat right.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   VisiCalc for the iPhone?
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   No, I mean, I just know that he wrote VisiCalc.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   It's first-passed on app.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   You can do note-taking with your finger.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   You can just write right on the screen.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   Oh, I like that.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:30.800]   It's really cool.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   Dan's...
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   We've had Dan on, he's really a neat guy.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   Really.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.800]   When I first met him, I was just so loud.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.800]   Here's the man who changed the world, really.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   And very humble.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   Oh, he's a real deal.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   And a nerd.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   I mean, just, you know, he's...
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   Right.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.800]   You meet people like him or Waz, and you go, this is what it was like in the
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   other days.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   And I just, like, think of them when people are like, "Oh, gosh, I'm destroying the world."
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   I'm like, the people I know that have met, like, Dan, who really just tried the world don't walk around,
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   going, "Oh, no, I'm destroying it."
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   They just do it.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   I don't know if that's...
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:06.800]   Has entrepreneurial...
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:07.800]   Has it changed something?
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:08.800]   I don't understand what happened.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   I still think there's people like that.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.800]   Andy Bios like that.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   He just makes awesome stuff.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   We can't do a show.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.800]   We need the entrepreneurs.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:14.800]   That's how we're doing it.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   And this Wednesday is our jury.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.800]   And I have folks like Clay Shurkey and Fred Wilson coming in to judge the
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.800]   students' businesses.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   And there's $50,000 of real money from the Merhormack Foundation on the hook here to start the
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.800]   businesses.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   Three of my students last year are running businesses as a result.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   And it's great to see what happens with the students.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   Grades are one thing.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.800]   Money's another.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   And they're working like crazy.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.800]   I was on the...
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   Skype calls this morning with WordMeads with three of them trying to work out their businesses.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   It really has an impact.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.800]   I'm not going to be one of Smash Entrepreneurship and that.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   I'm not going to be Smash Entrepreneurship just the way people...
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.800]   Just being a dick.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:49.800]   Well, that's...
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.800]   That...
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.800]   That...
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   You need that bloodthirsty...
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   I think you might need that kind of bloodthirstiness these days to succeed, don't you?
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   I'm not a dick though.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   No.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   I don't think...
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.800]   I just think people confuse bloodthirstiness with execution.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   Yeah, Google, I don't think anybody...
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   I don't think you'd say anybody at Google is trying to be master of the universe.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   No, but they're doing pretty well.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   They're doing pretty well for themselves.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.800]   It's what I'm saying.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   I'm just saying you don't...
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.800]   I think sometimes people see...
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   People who naturally are, that's their...
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.800]   Maybe that's their personality, their attitude.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.800]   And then they think, "Well, now for me to be successful at my startup or business, I have to act that way."
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   One, I don't think you should ever act like someone who's not you.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.800]   That's a big mistake.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.800]   And two, I don't think you need to do that to be successful.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   Like, I was just saying people like Dan or Andy make amazing stuff and are great entrepreneurs and they don't necessarily...
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.800]   We're like an...
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:39.800]   Where's...
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.800]   The writer now.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:46.800]   I was just going to play "You've got to have heart" but that's the...
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   This isn't exactly a Google story.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.800]   Not even really a cloud story.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:56.800]   It's kind of a social story and it's not on the links but I kind of mentioned this because it's today.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.800]   DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Products Project, somebody.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   The guys who invented the internet are celebrating the 40th anniversary of that invention with a new DARPA challenge.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.800]   This is a DARPA network challenge and I thought this was kind of interesting.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:19.800]   If you go to networkchallenge.darpa.mil today, this morning, as we do this show, which is Saturday December 5th,
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:30.800]   they launched or raised 10 moored 8 foot red weather balloons at 10 fixed locations in the continental United States.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.800]   They're very visible.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   They've got a number on them.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   They've got the DARPA logo on them.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   They're moored so they don't move around.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:43.800]   The challenge is, they say, a competition to explore the roles, the internet and social networking play,
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:50.800]   and the timely communication, wide area team building, and urgent mobilization required to solve broad scope,
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:54.800]   time critical problems like the end of the world or something.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:59.800]   The challenge is, and I think there's a $40,000 cash prize which may be think of it, Jeff,
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   to the first entrant to submit the latitude and longitude of all 10 balloons.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:08.800]   Obviously, you can't do this by yourself. You've got to put together a team.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   If you put together the right team using Twitter or Facebook or social media or a website,
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   you might be able to win $40,000 by pinpointing all the balloons.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   The great thing that MIT is offering $2,000 a balloon and others are doing it openly,
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:31.800]   and we'll see who wins the greedy capitalists or the open hippies.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.800]   Well, maybe that's a demonstration of this.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   There's an open red balloon project at www.openredballoon.com that is doing the hippie version of this.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.800]   And I just think this is really interesting.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   I don't know. They've found a lot of balloons.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   It looks like they're very close to finding all the balloons with open red balloon.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   There's a duplicate of a couple of them.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   How long has it taken them?
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.800]   Since this morning.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:57.800]   That's it?
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.800]   Well, that's what I think fast enough.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:06.800]   I'm glad DARPA did this because it's an example of virtual organization and cooperation.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.800]   Practice.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.800]   Kind of a neat idea.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   I don't know. I mean, you really think Jeff people just do stuff.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   I think some stuff, money works and other stuff.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.800]   It doesn't.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:16.800]   Who is it?
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.800]   Oh, I absolutely agree.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.800]   Which face was it?
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:26.800]   Someone from Draper Fisher who during one of the elections in California decided he was going to pay people to vote or something?
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   It didn't work at all.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   I think that gets them in jail too.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   Yeah, you're not really allowed to do this.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   That is illegal, yeah.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.800]   But I understand the notion there.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   Malcolm Gladwell talks about this in, I think, was outliers where you can ask doctors to do something pro bono and they'll gladly do it.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.800]   But the minute you say, "Well, we'll pay you $50 to do it."
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.800]   They go, "Well, I'm worth a hell of a lot more than that."
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.800]   Right, right, right. Exactly.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.800]   Anyway, I just thought it was kind of interesting.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.800]   Well, give me a few greagull.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   Now, if you get a pubic, that's the doctor's cut.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   That's right.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   There you go.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.800]   Let's get Gina's tip of the week.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.800]   Oh, so Leo, can I throw one million more?
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   One more story.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.800]   I should always give you a chance, yes, because I often miss the good ones.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.800]   Just, I was at the FTC hearings.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:17.800]   They called the workshop on the future of journalism or survival journalism this week.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   And Murdoch spoke, and then Ariana Huffington spoke after that.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   I, I, to spoke urging the FTC to stay off our lawn.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:25.800]   There's an unholy trio.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   Oh, Ariana Huffington, Rupert Murdoch, and Jeff Jarvis on stage.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   And, and Steve Brill in the form of agreement.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.800]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.800]   How did no one really stay out of this?
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.800]   The overlap must have been outrageous.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   It was.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.800]   So, I just wanted to give you this, that Ariana had a great speech.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.800]   It's up on Huffington Post, of course.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:48.560]   But she collected, she curated, she aggregated, pick your word, the words that Murdoch and
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.800]   company have been using about Google and aggregators lately.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.800]   And I can't do it in the accent.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.800]   But she's--
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   Well, now I'll do it for you.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:55.800]   Well, either one.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.800]   Either Ariana's or Rupert's.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:01.800]   But I should, I should treat this so you can't hather.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:08.800]   They call them parasites, content, clippimaniacs, vampires, tech, tapeworms in the intestines
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:09.800]   of the internet.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   They refer into the entrepreneurs who are only making our entire economy run as parasites,
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.800]   blood sucking vampires, horrible little people full of pus.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:22.800]   [laughter]
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   And you're just jealous and sad about the old salad days of Rupert with henchot and your
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   boss in the Mediterranean and drink wine and you have crazy ideas of new business and we
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   would have a wonderful time.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.800]   And it's just sad and old with you and your trusted property.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.800]   Okay, Heather, let's take it up a notch here.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.800]   Now do Rupert against Ariana.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.800]   God, I don't know if I can do, I don't know much.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.800]   I can do Rupert.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:46.800]   I'll do Rupert.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.800]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.800]   Heather, go ahead.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.800]   Well, Rupert said that, what Rupert said.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   What would he say, man?
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   Well, he's saying that your pirate and infested pirates, that's what you are.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   [laughter]
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.800]   Oh, it's a problem there, Ariana, Huffington.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.800]   I think you've lost your style.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.800]   Ah, yeah, dry up all by.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.800]   I know when you made new things.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:12.800]   When in my day, you know, we would make a newspaper, we would print it on a piece of paper.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.800]   But you're there has gone, Rupert.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   And you would pay for it.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   It's gone.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.800]   Now you want to steal me blind.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.800]   It's done, it's too late.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.800]   Your store from the people before you has been done before.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   We learned from you, Rupert.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.800]   And besides, I knew Picasso.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.800]   [laughter]
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.800]   All right, thank you, Jeff.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.800]   Cut this off before we kill again.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:31.800]   All right.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.800]   So, yeah, did you guys already cover the Rupert entirely?
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.800]   I just want to say, Cara Swisher's piece is really what she--
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.800]   What did she say?
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:46.800]   She brought a really entertaining piece where she translates Eric Schmidt's response on the Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:47.800]   Oh, I liked his response.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.800]   What did she say about it?
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.800]   It was hilarious.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.800]   Like, you can call it "addressed me as Emperor Palpatine."
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.800]   [laughter]
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:58.800]   Basically, you know, we own everything.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800]   Wow.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   There can be only one.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.800]   I don't really understand.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.800]   I mean, I want-- maybe you already addressed it, Jeff, but I want to hear your take on the supposed--
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   we're going to do it.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   It's almost too easy.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800]   It's almost too easy.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.800]   It's really almost too easy.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.800]   It's like such a blatantly bad idea.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   It's a sitting duck.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.800]   But it's getting too close to reality.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   We have Trinity Mirror in the London this week talked about how we have to give up SEO and this is ridiculous.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:32.800]   And the content heads that he created a site that purposely doesn't have an SEO and has ridiculous navigation just to fool that Google.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.800]   [laughter]
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.800]   We got you, Google.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.800]   We don't have any sight maps.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.800]   What?
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.800]   Where's my nose?
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.800]   Where's my face?
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   We have no one reading us, but screw you.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.800]   Screw you, Google.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.800]   Yeah, you certainly--
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:51.800]   Literally, they took off navigation that makes any sense, like movies, and put up navigation like, "Wow!"
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.800]   [laughter]
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   See, that's what I mean.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:00.800]   It's just so bone-headed that all you have to do is just go, "Wow!" and let them die.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.800]   I mean, there it is.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   I got it.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   Matt Kelly, who's going to-- who will now hate me.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.800]   Sounds entertaining.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.800]   It's the head of Trinity Mirror.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   And let me see if I can find this here.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.800]   They started a site called--
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.800]   Daily Nares, Matt Kelly puts SEO in its place.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800]   This is in the Guardian.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   Yes, that's very good.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:24.800]   He started 3 a.m. and he says, "You'll notice we ignored the SEO brigade here."
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   I want somebody British acting as the best as I get.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:28.800]   It's the southern angle.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.800]   So instead of navigation that would perform well in Google, like music, news, celebrity
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   and news, and by the way, perform well in the human brain, they all changed the navigation
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.800]   and the emotional methodology, Gasp Tihi Fwar.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   And did anybody click on it?
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   Is there an example of the page?
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.800]   It's ridiculous.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   I would love to find the page.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.800]   Is the page up anywhere?
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.800]   Let's see.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:03.800]   Mirror Football has-- 3 a.m.co.uk has 800,000 unique users.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.800]   I think Buzz Machine will be rapidly approaching that.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   So this is the celebrity news 3 a.m. gossip gone toxic.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   Oh, look.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   Ooh, Gasp, Gir, Fwar, Tihi, and Dairi.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   Dear Dairi, today I screwed the SEO contingent.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   That is interesting.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   I don't-- you know, I guess I'd click on Ooh.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   No, how often would you click on Ooh Lea?
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   I guess I'd click on--
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   You're gonna find the thread story there, the twine story, Geez.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   But how do you find-- do they have a search?
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   Oh, they have a search.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800]   I don't know.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.800]   He says, "It means not letting SEO wag the dog."
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.800]   Yeah, wag the dog.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.800]   It's just such.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800]   So the point is--
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   But they noticed they did it to a stupid site that cost them nothing.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.800]   Yeah, for the point.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.800]   But there's talk of suing aggregators now.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   It's getting really stupid, especially in Europe.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.800]   And Europe is, of course, a heavy regulation environment.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.800]   So I do fear what's gonna happen here.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.800]   I think the Murdoch is what he's-- it's stupid.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.800]   It's a matter of negotiation for MySpace.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   MySpace underperformed by $100,000-- $100,000,000.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   That's what that's about from there.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   But there's damage to be caused here.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   So people who say, "Oh, yeah, just let Rupert do it.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   I hate him anyway."
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   It's a bad precedent.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.800]   I get very nervous and I'm very hinky about this.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   So you really think there is a risk?
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   Gee-chee.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   Good word.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   Hinky.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800]   Hinky.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.800]   Well, I mean, my impression of almost comes from reading Julie Anguins and talking to her.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.800]   I mean, I think her book, Stilling MySpace, is really great.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.800]   But my impression was that Murdoch didn't totally get what he was doing.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800]   No, I was always--
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.800]   Really?
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.800]   So why would he-- that mean he'd know any more what he's doing now?
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   I mean, he's-- he probably doesn't.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.800]   But I don't think-- I don't think Jeff or anybody asserts that he does.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.800]   Oh, Jeff definitely does.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.800]   But really that he's dangerous.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   Because he does it?
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800]   Yes.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800]   I tweeted something today about him.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.800]   It's like Sarah Palin, anything?
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.800]   I tweeted Mediaite.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   I had the Financial Times chronically in the fall of MySpace.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   Yeah, let's follow Rupert.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   He did a great job there.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   What?
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800]   So anyway.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   Sorry.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800]   No, no, that's good.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.800]   Do you want to talk about the article in e-consultancy, what a lot of rubbish everyone is talking about?
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.800]   Google and paywalls?
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:26.800]   Yeah, the problem there was that when Google extended the idea of one--
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.800]   Yeah, we never mention this first click free.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.800]   We should talk about this actually.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.800]   This is a story.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800]   Is this in response to Murdoch, Jeff?
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800]   No, that's the thing.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   That's why they-- and what that story Leo just showed.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.800]   Social, they all got it wrong.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   What they are doing is giving publishers more power and more control.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   Right.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   So the idea is right now--
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800]   What was this feature?
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.800]   Right now, you can have a closed site.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.800]   You Google the result.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.800]   You click on it.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.800]   It gives you an excerpt as the Wall Street Journal will and say, now you've got to pay for the rest.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.800]   What this gives the publisher now is the right to set a few pages a day that you can look at.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:04.800]   And you just set one before and the problem was they said people were going in and doing it all the time.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.800]   So now you can set five, like a frequency cap.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.800]   It's just another control.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.800]   It's like robots.txt.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   It just gives you one little bit more control over the use of your content and then the action that occurs from it.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   Now e-consultancy says you can circumvent this.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.800]   So the user can circumvent this.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.800]   Yeah, of course.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:28.800]   My argument was with Google and I said this last week because they're trying to make friends and people want enemies.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.800]   And I think that's the issue here.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   But I don't think they should be sucking up or making any attempt to suck up.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.800]   They should be supporting the future of journalism and the future of journalism by God.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.800]   It's entrepreneurial.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.800]   I think Google is actually surprisingly strategic.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.800]   I think sometimes they do something like this not to suck up but to say, look, we tried.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.800]   That knowing full well that these guys aren't going to have no interest in working with them.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.800]   That's not enough.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   And they say, but hey, we made the effort and so that lets them off the hook.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.800]   I think that they do that all the time.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.800]   It's like an Obama move.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   It's smart.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.800]   Yeah, it's Chajitsu.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   I think they are smart about it.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.800]   If you need my sister, then I apologize.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.800]   Right.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.800]   See, I'm really a good person.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800]   I do know evil.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.800]   Hunter Joe in the NRC, say, "Mordox like Hearst, the more zempar dwindles, the more reckless and dangerous he gets."
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.800]   Do you think that's true of anybody running anything that's having trouble that they start reacting?
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800]   Is he going to start a war?
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   He's going to start a Spanish.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.800]   They don't know what else to do.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.800]   We need a war.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.800]   Rupert's going to say that.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.800]   We need a war.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.800]   All right.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:30.800]   Let's say anything else before we wrap this sucker up.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.800]   Going, going.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:35.800]   Well, I guess I'd say supernova was really rad.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.800]   I'll put in a plug there.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.800]   It was a great conference this week.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.800]   Kevin Warbuck, it's a warden.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.800]   Had a lot of great people there.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800]   Esther Dyson had a really good panel.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.800]   There were a bunch of good conversations.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.800]   I think it's worth checking out if you're interested in, especially some policy related conversations.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.800]   I think there were really useful some of Obama's people there.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:59.800]   A lot about real time data flow that Tontak, Chelic, I know there are hardcore geeks here, so I'm telling you, I think you might be interested in that conversation.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.800]   Absolutely.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   I'm sorry I missed it.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.800]   I keep wishing they'd do it in Philadelphia where this school actually is.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800]   I could go.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.800]   I had a lot of fun to ask me to do the closing entertainment.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.800]   I'd like to follow Peter Goober, who is this old time, old time.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   He wouldn't think of himself that way, but he produced Color Purple, Flash Ants.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.800]   He's been around Hollywood.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.800]   A long time he's a big deal producer, and he was hilarious.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:27.800]   As he tried to convince all these Czech thinkers and entrepreneurs that the money he was talking about was really big money.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.800]   It was really kind of entertaining.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:35.800]   Anyway, I had a good time, but I think the toy audience would really dig the Tontak and Kevin's flow.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:36.800]   He's had online.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.800]   It is online.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.800]   It's archives.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.800]   You go to supernovahub.com and you'll be able to access the use stream of it.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.800]   Excellent.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.800]   Look forward to that.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.800]   Time now for our tip of the week starting with Gina Trapani.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.800]   The tip got us.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.800]   Cool.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.800]   This one's a really simple one.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:57.800]   It's for wave users who have too many things in their inbox.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.800]   It's the shift key.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   You can select a bunch of different waves and archive them in one shot.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.800]   It's a clean out your wave inbox immediately.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.800]   You don't have to go one by one.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800]   Oh, I need this.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.800]   I do too.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.800]   I love that all the Twig listeners are making waves and adding you and I and Jeff to them.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.800]   It probably means you have a pretty stacked up inbox like I do.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800]   Unusable inbox.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.800]   I can't even figure out what's going on in my inbox.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.800]   You can do a search for whatever for Twig say in your inbox and then you can hold down the
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.800]   shift key and select a bunch of different waves.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.800]   Then you can do something with all of them.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800]   You can move them to a folder.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.800]   You can archive them one shot.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:40.800]   You can follow, unfollow, whatever you want.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.800]   The shift key is key in wave.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.800]   Okay.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:45.800]   So I go to the search thing.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.800]   I say in colon inbox and then I say, let's say Twig.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.800]   I put my search.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.800]   And then you'll get a bunch of waves back.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.800]   And then I shift click.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   Just hold down the shift key.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.800]   Shift to click and then you can select a range of waves.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.800]   I see.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   Just like a real computer.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.800]   Just like, yeah, just like a desktop app.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800]   Wow.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.800]   But you can't control click.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.800]   So you can change the shift and a range.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.400]   So you really have to search to figure out exactly what waves you want to find.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.840]   And now Jeff's kept its secret long enough.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.840]   He will now be here.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.840]   Now we're not here to it.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.800]   It was like the, you know, it was like, Groucho Marx and the duck was going to fall.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.800]   Oh, no.
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.080]   In Eric Schmidt's Wall Street Journal op-ed in enemy territory.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:31.360]   I've often quoted the number that Google News brings a billion clicks a month to news
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.360]   publishers.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.560]   Google, Eric Schmidt said that Google causes another three billion through search and other
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.720]   features.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.720]   And there's this wonderful quote that is 100,000 opportunities a minute.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.400]   Yeah, that was awesome.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.720]   And generate revenue for free.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.720]   Wow.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.160]   And so it's not Google's fault.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.160]   It's your fault.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.160]   Yeah, that was the big.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.120]   Ah, that was a great line.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.120]   Say that again.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.120]   Say the number again.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.840]   100,000 opportunities a minute.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.640]   And the failure here is the publishers.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640]   It's not cool.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.440]   So if it's not working for you, dude, this idea that audience is worthless.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:11.080]   I guess I can't quote it Twitter, but there was a great line.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.080]   Let's see.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.080]   I'll clean it up.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:18.600]   Brit said, oh, so nice to think that editors think we're all worthless butt hats.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.840]   Did he say the word butt hats?
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.840]   No, he didn't.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:24.840]   All right.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.320]   I mean, he had a different term.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.600]   Can I say one more thing?
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600]   Mm hmm.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.600]   I want to.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.040]   I am to podcasts as Tiger Woods is to wives.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.040]   I'm not one.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.040]   I have another podcast I do.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.040]   Yes.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.040]   Media Talk USA, which is for the Guardian.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.600]   Guardian.co.uk/mediatalkUSA.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.760]   The reason I'm bringing this up is because this month I had on Baratunde Thurston and
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.320]   thanks to you introducing us on Twitter and he was just great.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   I love Baratunde.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.480]   So thank you for that introduction.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.440]   In fact, he's going to be on Twitter again this Sunday.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.440]   He is.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.640]   Yeah, he's a very talented, very funny guy.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.240]   And smart about tech like Heather Gold is.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.040]   And media too, and all that.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.840]   I know I was on a panel with Baratunde and asked me to describe what I did and then Baratunde
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.840]   was next.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.640]   He said, I'm basically Heather Gold.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.760]   Because we're separating at birth, me and Baratunde.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.040]   I'm the lesbian Heather Gold.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.040]   That's right.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.040]   That's what he is.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.520]   Media Talk USA, a new rival for the Washington Post.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.880]   The new episode with Baratunde should be up I think Monday.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.080]   Okay, so it's not up yet.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.080]   All right.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.080]   There you go.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.080]   It's a Guardian.co.uk.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   That's just like you.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.080]   They edit.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.080]   Oh, nice.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.600]   There are those who say I should, but I won.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.720]   No, no, no, I'm glad you don't.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.720]   I refuse.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.880]   That's super fun.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.040]   Our tool of the week, it's free from Google.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:47.440]   And I think in a way this might be a little stocking horse for something Google would
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.080]   like to do more generally free Wi-Fi for the holidays.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.320]   They were doing it first with Virgin America.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.480]   They were providing free Wi-Fi and Virgin America flights.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.760]   I think they're going to do that through January.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.720]   And now through January 15th, they're offering free Wi-Fi at 54 US airports as well as every
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.960]   Virgin America flights.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.520]   So if you've been going to your airport and having to buy a T-Mobile account or, you know,
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.400]   wait, what do they call it?
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.800]   Wayport account or whatever.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:22.600]   You can just use the Google and it's pretty much all the big airports as far as I can
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.320]   tell except for SFO.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.320]   Pastors.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.320]   Is New York.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.080]   San Diego this week.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.080]   San Diego is in there.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.080]   New York is not.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.080]   Look, what is not.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080]   Chicago.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.080]   Oh, here.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.080]   Let me see.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.080]   Let me see.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.080]   That's my trip tomorrow.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.520]   No, see, this is a little it's like, well, you know why I'm sure Google went to all of
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.160]   these airports and they said, no, we make too much money off of this.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:52.440]   But look, this is how you put pressure on airports to start doing this kind of thing.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:57.760]   So free Wi-Fi, check it out at your airport and I'm going to fly a Virgin America to CES.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.720]   So I'll let you know how that works in January.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:01.800]   Just do us one favor Leo.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.080]   Don't get up in the air and say, wow, I'm tweeting from an airplane.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.320]   I'm going to send a 12 second post.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.480]   I'm going to send a tweet.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.480]   I'm going to do it all.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.480]   I'm going to do it all.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.480]   I'm going to play World of Warcraft, man.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.600]   I'm going to make some gold.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.600]   I'm doing everything.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.240]   Speaking of gold, Heather Gold.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.240]   Right on.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.040]   Where is, where can we catch your, your act?
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.600]   You catch me.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.800]   My dates are at Heather Gold dot com and if you have a newsletter and I tweet out and
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.880]   all the dates, I'll be next in Vermont.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.240]   I think actually, you know, Christmas is a big time for Jew comedy.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.240]   In Vermont.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.560]   I do also, and wherever they're Jews and they're stuck in lots of places, not just the lower
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.920]   east side of New York.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:45.200]   And I'm also doing a little, I'm also like, Jeff Nott, totally monogamous with the show.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:50.840]   So I do a little thing called morning Jew and morningjews.com.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.760]   Katie Halper of the Huffington Post and Rachel Schlar of Mediaite where we do the headlines
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.760]   and ask, is it good for the Jews?
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.760]   I'm listening to that.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.760]   That sounds great.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:03.440]   So that's going to be starting again in the New Year at me, the morning Jews with a Z or
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.040]   Z, depending on what country we're in, dot com.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.320]   Heather Gold Show will hopefully be here later.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.480]   Tom will vision will be here.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.320]   And here by here, you mean to it dot TV.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.320]   You're meaning to it dot TV.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.320]   Yeah, we're very interested in getting the Heather Gold Show on a level.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.320]   But it's going to be great.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.320]   So that's like a, that'll be more like late night fun, entertaining.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.320]   That was funny.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   I'm sure Barritain will be hopefully.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.520]   I googled morning Jews and I got the Jewish federations of North America.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.360]   Not for long, Twitter me.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.160]   Can you fix that?
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.840]   So basically like if it's a media story by a Jew, that's something to talk about or not.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.840]   We'll find the angle.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.840]   We'll find the jingle to Tiger Woods.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:44.120]   I'm sure he's an accountant involved in this issue now.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.920]   Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:47.920]   That's his great blog.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.200]   And I'm going to be a fan of this, I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.280]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.640]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.280]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.840]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.040]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.880]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.520]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.360]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.000]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.760]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.680]   I'm going to be a fan of this.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:19.680]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:20.960]   You want to get it.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.880]   Gina Turbani's book is on the internet.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.880]   Yes, it is.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.400]   She's cooler.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:31.280]   It is the complete guide to Google Wave.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.480]   Google waveguide.com.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.280]   Yeah, completewaveguide.com.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.280]   I know.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.280]   Get it wrong every frickin time.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.280]   I know.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.280]   It's very confusing.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280]   Gosh darn it.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280]   No, it's not you.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.480]   It should just get keyhole.com now that it's available.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.640]   Yeah, I'm sure nobody's using that.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.640]   Completewaveguide.com.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:52.640]   Of course, Gina is also at her own website, smartaware.org.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.800]   You see her regularly on lifehacker.com.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.640]   We'll be at the Heather Gold Show at South by Southwest.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.000]   Oh, yes we will.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.560]   Are you doing a South by Southwest?
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.560]   Great.
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:08.640]   Every year, always with some other great people, Harry Allen, Jay Smooth, Best Velocir, in my
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.520]   opinion on the web.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.520]   Very, very good.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.200]   Gina Turbani, maybe almost maybe.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.200]   Gee, you are.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.200]   Gina, that's enough.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.200]   New York is good enough.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.200]   Italian, Brooklyn.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.200]   Italian, Italian, Italian.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200]   Italian, Italian, Italian, Italian, yeah.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.200]   Italians are like butch juice.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.120]   And on that note, I want to thank you for watching.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:33.000]   You can get the video of this on many video devices, including the BlackBerry and the
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.160]   Android phones.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:39.920]   If you use the MediaFly application on Roku, Popcorn Hour, and soon iTunes.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.080]   In fact, I think this week we'll have it up for the iTunes feed so you can subscribe
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.360]   to both high and low feeds.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.760]   And also at twit.tv you'll be able to download or just watch the video.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:51.760]   So that's good.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.720]   But if you've seen it, I was watching the other day on Roku.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.120]   It just looks fantastic.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.120]   Nice.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.200]   They really did a nice job with this.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.200]   We thank you for listening.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.280]   We thank you for watching and we'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
