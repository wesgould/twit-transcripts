[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.420]   465 recorded Wednesday July 18th 2018 Cindy and Dindy
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.820]   This weekend Google is brought to you by wink the best way to discover new wines
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.500]   You'll love go to try wink.com/twig and get $20 off your first shipment
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.500]   It's time for twig this week in Google. Oh, I am really excited about our episode this week
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.060]   Everybody's here. I mean everybody Jeff Jarvis back from DLD. He's calling from his home office
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.660]   Glowing like an angel. What is that? What is that his t-shirt says?
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.660]   You honest Gutenberg 10 but is it 1400 to 1468? Oh
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.500]   I went to the mines back to the Gutenberg Museum where I also got a
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.420]   Eximally Gutenberg Bible. Oh wow. Can you read that? It's in it's in like
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.940]   Not only is it in German. It's like in old German. So what it's in Latin? Oh, yes, right? They didn't translate in a very few spaces. Yeah, no vernacular
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.340]   That's right. Was that before they used a punctuation and space?
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460]   No, they had some I just I'm reading a book
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.860]   I just found out when when the various things of punctuation were invented the period the comma was actually started as a slash
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.180]   The askclamation point they were they were first used to various points. It's really good. I find that fascinating
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.460]   It's all fascinating. Oh absolutely fascinating. That's because we're kind of weird word. Yeah, we are
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:21.020]   Stacey Higginbotham is also here. It's great to have Stacey visiting us from the Pacific Northwest where she has escaped the climate of Austin, Texas
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.020]   Whoa, I think that's disloyal Stacey. No, it's not most time. There's a problem really
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:36.140]   We did we did camp is it's a hundred and five there this week guys. Oh, yeah
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.180]   Do you have to keep the air conditioning on a certain level in the house? So it doesn't like try it doesn't boil my fish. Yes, oh
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.180]   It's dangerous being a fish in Austin
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.980]   And I'm really thrilled to have Mike Elgin in studio
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.300]   We love having Mike here Mike is a
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.780]   Peripatetic global traveler
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:07.780]   Gastronomad as we call it a gastronomad. He has a new new hairdo a new hairdo. Yes a different look. That's right. That's right. Really?
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.620]   Yeah, okay, you crew cut it. Yeah, any and you're very tanned. Yes
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.540]   We're not a lot. Where have you been? We have recently been in Italy France and
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.260]   Switzerland hot in all of the above even Switzerland even Switzerland was hot
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.540]   It was like I'm low 80s and you're home to visit Princess squishy face
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.940]   We are here to visit Princess squishy face and bask in her celestial cuteness. Oh, yeah
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.260]   That's so nice. It's so it's great. I always really appreciate Mike brought us a nice bottle of wine from a
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.960]   Time what kind of loss it's a shot to shot toe known. It's a red. It's a Grinash
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.020]   Sarabland that
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.180]   Leo and Lisa are gonna love never it's a varietal. I've never had what was a ventu. I can't remember
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.740]   Ventu is the is yes the appellation. It's a pretty small appellation in
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.300]   Southern Rome. I can't wait. Yeah, so you're gonna love it
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.100]   awesome
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.420]   We are gathered together to speak of the five billion dollar fine that was just leveled
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.820]   At Google and I'm really curious
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.620]   We had a debate in fact it got a little heated on Windows weekly this morning because I
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:25.340]   Think this is it a really kind of appalling, but I would like to hear what you all think the European Commission says
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.940]   There were three things that caused it to do this fine three things that Google must correct the next 90 days
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.540]   It's abused its Android market Dom and install about Android in three ways
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.100]   Bundling its search engine and Chrome apps into the operating system
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.540]   number one
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.260]   Blocking phone makers. This is the one this one. I agree with blocking phone makers from creating devices
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.700]   That run forked versions of Android if you so Google Android is open source anybody can use it
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.580]   Amazon has of course Amazon is based the fire
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.060]   Operating system is Android, but it doesn't have the Google Play Store any of the Google services on it
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.420]   And that's legal. It's legit if you want the Google Play Store you have to have Chrome and the default search has to be Google in the phone
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.060]   And this is the one that I disagree with I think Google
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.660]   Overstepped their bounds. They also apparently told phone makers if you want Google services on your phones
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.380]   You can't make any phones with pure Android you can't make a non Google phone
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.620]   And then finally and this is something Google had stopped a few years ago made payments to certain large
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.660]   manufacturers and mobile network operators to exclusively bundle the search app on handsets Google
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.740]   Apparently learned about the EU investigation three years ago four years ago and stopped doing that at that time
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:50.300]   So really two things Google still does apparently they must stop in the next three day three months Google says they will appeal and
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.340]   Actually, I thought there was quite a good
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.460]   Blog post by Sundar Pichai in which he said
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.580]   Google has Android rather has created more choice
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.860]   Amen, yeah, and of course the windows people are going to be in favor of all of this because
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.980]   Window this is this is comparable in many ways to the
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.620]   anti-trust attack on Microsoft the 90s
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.500]   bundling internet Explorer because of course it that guaranteed that Internet Explorer would dominate everything which was
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.980]   Turned out to be boy. I put a story on the rundown Mike that said that goes in why it's different
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.460]   Yeah, yeah, we actually talked about this last week and why it was different and Leo. I felt like you explained that pretty well
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.960]   I wish I can remember what I said
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:45.700]   It was basically along the lines of this is at the operating system. No, it wasn't at the operating system
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.380]   Well, so the biggest of course Mike covered this. Yes, you were in chief of Windows magazine at the time
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.120]   We covered it. It was exactly the the DOJ investigation of Microsoft started when we launched tech TV in 90
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.260]   1998 and so we covered that for six years that went on and on and then later EU's action I
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.060]   Actually, I still don't think it's such a bad thing to bundle the browser in the operating system
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.180]   irrelevant, but the biggest difference I think is that the purpose of Windows was to be
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:23.600]   Behave is a platform for others the purpose of Android is to get Google search in the people's hands that Android
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.260]   Exists probably because Google wants to make the world safe for its search engine and doesn't want just Apple taken over other
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:37.220]   Because if there was no Android right and there were Symbian or whatever operating systems one could imagine for smartphones
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.940]   They could all just say well, you know what Google's two dominant. We just won't have Google
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.140]   We won't let Google on and so that's why they came out with Android
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.100]   Well, I don't like a world where there's no where there's iOS and Symbian is not a world
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.020]   More than just getting the browser in hands
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.500]   Although obviously from business perspective, but I think it was it was really about trying to create it was
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.980]   trying to create a competitive marketplace and
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:06.220]   By making it free. I mean that's that that's the problem that antitrust laws are so outdated
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:13.940]   What what in other times would look like dumping is instead a great favor to consumers by making this free and getting
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:20.540]   More low priced phones out there and I also think Google didn't do the wrong thing doesn't do the wrong thing in requiring manufacturers to either do pure
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:27.660]   Either do authorized Android or unauthorized Android, but to do both is gonna be really brand confusing all this talk
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:33.460]   We hear about fragmentation that would be even worse. So I think Google's perfectly right Stacy. Go ahead
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.940]   Don't know I actually agree with Jeff on this which is whoa
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.540]   Had to say
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:48.020]   Well, you know there are there are topics Jeff where we disagree, but this one I'm with you and I remember last week
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.060]   We kind of came to this conclusion. I think it's a good one, which is
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.180]   We don't have the antitrust infrastructure right now or the rules to
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:00.140]   To govern the way we build hardware software and technology
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:07.780]   Prach or technology businesses today. So I think that's probably where we should take this focus in the US
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:14.940]   This isn't an issue because Android and iOS are roughly at parity about 50% each so neither is dominant
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.820]   There's no monopoly position. So it's not an issue apparently in the EU
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:25.180]   Google has not only 80% of all the search. It has 75% of all the phones
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:30.660]   Yeah, so it is I don't know if that's a monopoly, but it is it is fairly dominant and
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:36.500]   The EU and Jeff you're the expert on EU anti-trust law
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.380]   Seems to fit seems to favor competition among companies and so feels like that Google's dominant position
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.680]   Makes it hard for others to compete. Well, I saw the fact that Google
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.660]   Bought Android and kept it open source
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:56.140]   Amen and they are a lot of people and if you would like the Google services
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.940]   It doesn't seem to me unreasonable if you want the play store to say well, you got include Google services
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.460]   Which equality home? Yeah, and that by the way, that's driven by consumer demand
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:13.860]   Consumers prefer an Android device with Google's play store on it then not so consumers are saying that it gives them an easier
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.260]   I mean if you have to
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:20.100]   Make a slightly different version of your app for like the Android app store for example
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:26.860]   That's that's gonna eliminate choice in apps and make it more difficult for developers and quote unquote innovation
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.700]   If that's more we're gonna focus our innovation
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:34.900]   So the way I look at it is there there are two big issues one is market dominance and the other is
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:41.580]   Kind of lock in the whole assumption about market dominance is that you can exclude others from the marketplace or
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:49.180]   Use your dominance in one market to yes and enter other markets and there are other there other action against Google was very much like that
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:54.020]   In with a shopping exactly exactly, but here you have the two dominant
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:01.900]   operating systems iOS and Android and on the one hand you have iOS which is completely dominant, you know that you cannot
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.340]   install iOS on a
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:11.540]   Phone that is not Apple's phone. That's what Chrome on iOS, but you can't get an app are approved and as soon our Pachai points out
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:19.580]   1,300 companies are running Android. Yeah, it is a very open system. There's a free version there. It's it's creating all this
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:26.020]   All these other companies including the most direct competitor to Google, which is which is Amazon
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:33.140]   Amazon uses the free version of Android to basically compete directly against Google so
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.420]   Amazon has all kinds of alternatives to the Google Play Store
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.700]   To to the content that Google is selling and stuff like that and Google just allows this that's how open they are
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:49.740]   They're most direct competitor is basing their entire platform on Android on the free version of Android
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.300]   Like if that isn't open, I don't know what is now if that isn't so generous policy
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.500]   I guess for lack of a better term. I don't know what is an apple you couldn't imagine anything like that from now
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:09.220]   But sooner Pachai has on his blog post a gif that shows you can remove Chrome from Android and install Opera in under 30 seconds
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.080]   So I I mean it seems to me the opposite of
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.300]   anti-competitive but
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.100]   And the browser doesn't really bring them huge advantage right they make your money
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.860]   Yeah, but the browsers would give them Google search. Yeah, I understood understood
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:29.140]   But search is only part of what they do now. They make their money from advertising and much of that advertising is off of search
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.860]   Yeah, we still work on the sites many or so
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.100]   Let me let me go back to your point about about antitrust
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.780]   of course the key difference between the US and Europe is in US it's about consumer protection in Europe. It's about company size and
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:45.020]   You know you got too big and there's no there's no statutory definition of too big
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.220]   But there's there's kind of a belief so last week
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.660]   I couldn't be on the show because I was in Europe doing a few things including going to the
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.420]   museum
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:13:00.260]   But I also met with the head of canneal the French data protection authority and another 10 people that she brought in
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.900]   for a conversation and then I met with
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:09.100]   the head of digital in the German Parliament and then I just had a conversation with European with
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.500]   UK regulators and it's an interesting shift in time right now where you know
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:18.820]   I've been out there being very critical of EU regulation and now some way they're willing to listen interest to that viewpoint
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:24.980]   And and I think that what we've seen in European regulation is that they're recognizing as protectionist
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.260]   Dorite bear the German
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.420]   MP who spoke at this conference where I was the
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.220]   Publishing company that throws the conference a dld
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:39.220]   An executive there did a speech beforehand and which he was trying to say we got to be innovative
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.660]   We got to be reasonable and we got to be realistic like Jeff Jarvis
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.540]   Okay, great, but then he defended the Leistung Schutzrecht a defended the
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.740]   Regulation they have but then she got up as a member of parliament and she's a conservative member of parliament
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.540]   But she scolded the publishers and she scolded them and said
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:59.500]   This is protectionist and it's not appropriate for the time and for the year
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:06.020]   So there's a time right now. There's a little window. I see where regulators may be open to different perspectives on this
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:14.660]   And and in France I had a reasonable discussion too. They were considering a fake news law that that has you know huge problems in the UK as well
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.700]   So so what we see happening is we see the courts with the right to be forgotten
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.780]   We see the antitrust regulators with this antitrust effort
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.660]   Which was really pushed very hard by publishers in Germany and then we have
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.260]   legislation going after things like privacy GDPR and
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.340]   Hate speech and all that so this is huge
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.860]   My second point is regulatory reflex in Europe and they when I sat down and talked to them
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.540]   It was kind of well. We're gonna regulate how should we?
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.900]   Rather than starting the same was there a problem we should be away
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:52.660]   Can I just say parenthetically completely parenthetically how refreshing it is to hear opposing viewpoints debated in a rational
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:15:03.020]   Sensible way and then a consensus attempt to reach consent. You're a Wow. How sophisticated those Europeans amen amen brother amen
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:10.580]   Okay, it was it was kind of great. It's interesting. So there is a little shift away from this
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.460]   I sense an opening I sense that not a chef but an opening to have a different kind of conversation and
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.140]   And I welcome that tremendously, you know, and and so I'm not against all regulation
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.980]   I'm forced mark regulation that starts with evidence of harm and evidence of issues
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.720]   So the issue back to back to that's a good question. Where is the evidence of harm? That's a very good
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.940]   Where's the harm? Yeah, there isn't any you can I soon dare Pichai does the CEO of Google point out
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.440]   There it seems to be only benefit you've got choice thirteen brands
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.540]   4,000 different devices at every price point all of that points to a diversity
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:49.340]   Yeah, that allows people choice and I tend to I tend to support the concept of democracy
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.220]   Whether it's political democracy. What's that I used to remember what that was and the reason
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.100]   Thing is the marketplace democracy
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.740]   People vote with their their dollars and and the Europeans love a free market. Yeah
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:10.260]   No, but the Europeans love Android and the Europeans love Google more than in the US by by a long shot
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:17.280]   Like you said I'm more oh, they buy 75% that's right. Yeah, so so it's like so it's like you're giving people
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.460]   European
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:23.820]   Regulators are supposed to be representing the people of Europe the people of Europe have spoken as far as I'm concerned
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.460]   They love and they love Android I
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:32.940]   Never do as easy it is to change the search engine on quorum reveal on the phone. Yeah, yeah
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:39.940]   That's one is where you've got iOS where there is no open source version only apple can make an iOS device
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:47.740]   You cannot uninstall the browser you cannot change the default search that you cannot change the default browser
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:53.820]   There's no problem with that series completely locked in and and virtual assistants or the new search engine anyway
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.580]   That's where we're so I'm just crazy. There is a choice. I choose to use I found most of the time
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.580]   But I'm just glad there is a choice from yeah
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:06.220]   Like that's really important to where where the the the they keep on thinking that Google is a search company
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.820]   And then and so they regulated to that and then it became a phone company
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:14.020]   I'm trying to regulate to that and as you're pointing out AI and voice is then and there and there's so far behind
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.940]   Yeah, that the battleground is way ahead of and that's exactly what happened to me with windows
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.800]   It by the time they they crack down on IE IE was pretty much dead in the water
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.300]   I know it's
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:30.900]   A lot of all of this is it takes so long that by the time they actually promulgate these rules is too late go ahead Stacy
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:37.700]   No, I was gonna say if we want to start looking at AI we need to look at how you access different data sets how
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:44.380]   You train those data sets to to believe different things in certain ways that would be the new kind of antitrust
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:50.260]   Battle and how do you limit your competitors access to that data or can they get that data in other ways?
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.780]   It's true because the battleground has shifted now
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.020]   Google has a massive advantage in AI
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:01.220]   well over well well ahead of Apple maybe not ahead of Amazon, but but
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:09.140]   So maybe we should be looking at how they're bundling and forcing people to use Google photos and the user agreements for I mean
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.140]   They'll do that in 10 years. It'll be I mean, it's
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.020]   But
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:18.860]   There are plenty of ways you can get that data. It's the same thing with self-driving cars
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.860]   So that's those are the battlegrounds of the future. I think and maybe the thing that
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.700]   We should be thinking about I don't want to see I mean no one wants to see a single dominant
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.420]   company in any of this and
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.380]   That's the argument I would make and certainly the argument Pachai makes is that Android creates choice
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.460]   It's not it's not greeting so I hope Google fights the hell out of this one
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:46.520]   Who does appeal to the appeal to the European court? Oh, that's a good question. There is a process
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.620]   appealing although
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.460]   Unless they can get a stay. I don't know. I don't know how it works in the EU
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:58.460]   But I would presume they have 90 days to make a whole lot here confirms it will appeal
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:04.420]   So it's a European Commission ruling
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:11.380]   By the way Google is also fighting at that other ruling that they got last year though
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:18.820]   Several billion dollars for the word for the Google shopping the biggest difference is that if it's just a fine Google
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.460]   You know, it's no big deal for Google to pay billions of dollars and fines in this case
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.220]   They have to change how they do whole business model for and its principle to
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:32.220]   You know, I think they've got a camera wave a little American flag for as long as I still can
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.500]   Before we switch to the Russian
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.940]   It's also about defending American technology companies
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.620]   there's an anti-American
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:49.820]   Flavor to this anti technology and anti-American and I think Google has to defend both and has to point out the value
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.820]   In the benefits that it brings
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.820]   Yeah
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.820]   when
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:01.020]   You buy an Android phone in China. It doesn't have the Google apps on it by Google's choice, right?
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:07.580]   Google doesn't get a bunch of bunch of the apps are banned in China. Yeah, I was gonna say but you can download
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:13.220]   I think you could still download the Google apps if you want but it doesn't come the Google Play Store doesn't come on there
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:19.020]   It's like the fire the Amazon fire platform. You could download the Google Play Store with a simple. Yeah chain
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:26.220]   It's a little different in China the Huawei and a couple of the other major smartphone vendors actually have Google apps on their play stores
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:31.900]   So like the Huawei play store you can download several Google apps not Gmail not, you know
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.660]   Some of the ones that are that the Communist Party doesn't like
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:40.260]   So Leo, I think this is the way it works. I think that Google actually appeals to the Commission and
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:46.620]   Then it goes to court. So there's a quote here from European Commission saying that Commission will defend its decision in court
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.220]   So I think that there's probably a process and then it does go to court
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:55.220]   Okay, so they don't have to pay the fine or change their business yet. I don't I don't know that yeah
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:59.660]   You know, I mean in the you ever whoever says the Wall Street Journal
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.860]   Sorry, sorry states have been just finished this week. Go ahead
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:07.060]   Google's appeal however won't stop the company from having to pay it's fine or comply with other elements of June ruling
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:12.980]   Which could if upheld have far reaching impacts on Google's increasingly sprawling business. Okay, so they do have to pay it now
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.820]   Which is ridiculous?
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:21.660]   Yeah, that is usually in the US if you appeal something you stop the clock on it being implemented if they pay and it's overturned
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.060]   Do they get a refund with interest?
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.860]   Question store credit
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.860]   You got it's been point
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:41.180]   All right, and then there's this Bloomberg opinion piece by Alex web that you were talking about Stacey Google
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.500]   It's not quite the same. What's going on with Google and Microsoft?
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.460]   We did we discussed this quite a bit in during Windows weekly
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:55.740]   And I knew that this that this panel would probably be pro Google and I was a little bit of Microsoft
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:01.420]   Fan shot in Freuda there was there, you know, I would never accuse Paul of that in fact
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:07.340]   He used to dislike Google and he's even said today, you know that those that's the old Paul. Yeah, I
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:14.900]   You know he did point out that you know Google's market share does you know make give reasonably give you cause for concern
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   how they may leverage that and
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.380]   And I certainly don't think now that you've given an
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.340]   Classification Jeff, maybe I'll change my tune on that notion of forcing handset makers to choose
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.280]   You know either you're a Google platformer. You're not you still can imagine the confusion
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.420]   You don't know if it's a good Android or a bad end. Yeah
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:41.980]   It's a little bit last week because we talked about like the security implications like of having the Google Store the play store
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:47.740]   On your device and if you in the sort of protections they've built into that that's a very few point
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:53.020]   It's a Wild West if you're not using the Google Play Store. Well, it occurs to me. That's why so so
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.260]   What do you call them Amazon?
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.180]   Couldn't have put out a pure Google phone when they did the fire the miserable fire phone
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.020]   Well, they could have
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:08.540]   But they were already putting on a bad a bad version of Android as a company
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.420]   Oh, I see
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.060]   They'd try to do a phone right they probably wouldn't have been allowed
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:18.580]   Not that they would have they wouldn't have been allowed to do a good Android phone and then what about this other accusation that Google
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.780]   Charges different amounts of money to different companies that they favor some companies that give them sweetheart deals
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.620]   on on Android
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:33.780]   Well, are they charging them different amounts of money or they created or they having the same kind of value associated with things and in doing different pricing?
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.460]   I mean, it's one thing for me to say hey Leo because you're having me on the show
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:43.420]   You know, I'll give you a discount on my time appearing on the show because there's a benefit to me, right?
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:48.940]   So they could have that because your market share is huge and you're promulgating the Android name in India
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.980]   We're gonna charge you less. Yeah, that doesn't seem that seems like a reasonable business
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:59.980]   That's what media companies do it all the time. Yeah, right friends and family. Yeah all kinds of that
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:07.380]   I mean, just go one after googles. Yeah, and it has to also be said and I'm always surprised by how little
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.980]   The F word comes up, but fair search is
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:17.820]   Basically an organization. It's basically Oracle and Microsoft and some other anti Google companies and they are driving all this stuff
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:24.220]   And and it's it's just I think there should be more criticism for an approach to business
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.460]   That basically says let's attack them in every way we can let's you know, let's get them in the courts on stuff
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.780]   It just it really fair search is a
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:41.060]   It's a really annoying organization. Here's their page fair search org and here's the press package on the Google Android decision
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:47.980]   Wonder how they feel about it. Hmm. It'll foster competition help may help restore competition for apps and operating systems
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.420]   Principles should apply to smart TVs as well as smartphones
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:59.620]   Fair search set a European Commission decision on Wednesday will help restore competition and mobile operating systems and apps vital for the digital economy
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.860]   By requiring Google to end abuses arriving arising from its control of Android
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.980]   Are they fighting to rest Android away from Google?
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.820]   What what bothers me?
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:20.300]   I don't know what bothers me about fair search is that there are areas where Microsoft and Oracle compete directly against Google and they should
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.660]   You know be aggressive in all those different ways, but what they what fair search does is they go after
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:29.980]   Every aspect of Google is just an anti Google. It's anti Google. It's not
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.620]   It's not yeah, here's really a perspective. I had to see the suit do it should sitone
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:41.820]   Which is one of the big respectable papers in Germany. I just put it on the rundown on the chat. So Europe Europe's
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.180]   billion-dollar
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.700]   penalty against Google is a warning to Trump
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.620]   Okay
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.140]   about I
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.620]   Think about about fair trade and such. Oh, you think it has to do with the trade war
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:03.020]   Well, what's what's wrong with that perspective is that this started three years ago five years ago
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.820]   This is going on for a while. Yeah, so this is this started in the Obama era
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.660]   Yeah, I think that's a little stretch. Yeah, I think it is
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:17.260]   But it's it's quite a you know for this paper to do that analysis is fascinating. Tell us about this paper
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.660]   What's it's the suit do I check? Yeah, it's
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:24.780]   You know, it's the Washington Post of Germany, okay, right? So there's two
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:32.500]   The Frank Fruh Frank Fruh to Angela Mina site doing and the zoo doe chit site doing are the daily papers from north and south
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.620]   And then dee site. I just look there. So I'm looking at the F A Z
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.380]   Sure, because I'm curious what the what the reception is in Europe
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.500]   And maybe you speak French
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.940]   Then it's top story on the F A F A Z the net. It's the top story
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:53.380]   You know, we will appeal the Commission the picture of Sundar
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.700]   What do they do with five billion dollars that they that they harvest from their Google ATM?
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.900]   Like do they do they do they lower taxes by five billion dollars?
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.500]   Are they buy more buildings in Brussels? What do they do with the money? It's a good question and
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.300]   Gosh, they give it to orphans. I think yeah, I don't think so no
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.420]   hmm
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:20.100]   They they definitely need money for both social services and if you think about
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.620]   migrant
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:26.820]   Challenges, that's probably but I'm gonna go into that's not the plan. That's not where it's going. Yeah
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:33.180]   It could fun. I mean it could fund the regulatory agency. Yeah, I mean what did governments do with fines anyway, right? I mean
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:38.340]   It's just you know, well in the US it depends on those bodies. It's finding
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.400]   So meanwhile the top story at the mirror is revealed
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:47.020]   San and Georgia the contestants who shocked a love Island by quitting after controversial recoupling
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.380]   So it's not taking over all of Europe. Love Island. Where's that and how can I get there?
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:28:00.140]   It's a cruise you'll be on Kerry. All right. I'm one of the violent crews Cara swisher. I love her lead
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:08.820]   Yesterday, I motored my Ford Fiesta down to Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park to interview CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.180]   Does she really drive a Ford Fiesta?
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:19.700]   Well, I just find that fascinating is that to establish your credentials as a woman of the people or yeah, I don't I'm it's an odd lead
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.300]   But she did get quite the story Zuckerberg defending
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.900]   Having
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.900]   Holocaust deniers
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:36.100]   This is why he needs to hire smart people like journalists and professors
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:48.340]   Many of my former colleagues work at Facebook. Yeah, but they work in a position to have policy and and this was just this is just naive and
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.340]   naive is too nice a word. It's ignorant
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.660]   That Tara is also a really good at her job. Oh, yeah
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.620]   Even if she still drives a Ford Fiesta. Here's the problem with globalization
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:05.580]   If you're Facebook and you want to be what Facebook is the the company that owns
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.380]   More users than people exist on the planet who?
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:14.740]   Rakes in all the money and has all the power and is the biggest source of news in history of mankind, etc, etc
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.980]   Then you have to be in Middle Eastern countries
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.620]   You have to be in countries where Holocaust denial is the official
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.660]   You think that's well absolutely
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.780]   Absolutely, and it's a problem on every topic
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:34.420]   You if there are certain topics where it's like oh you can't as a company you can't support that position in China as a company
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.300]   You can't support that position in these other places. He's got to please everybody
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:44.980]   And so it's like you if if the official line is to crack down on Holocaust and now you'll you'll actually be cracking down on
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.020]   Governments who are using family, but he also defends
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:54.700]   Sandy Hook deniers. I don't know what government wants that. Why don't you care asks want to just say get off our platform
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.500]   Mark response look as a born as I guess I could play the audio
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:04.300]   But I'll read it look as a born as some of this content could be I do think it gets down to this principle of giving people a voice
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:11.660]   Let me give you an example of where we would take it down and me and Marr Sri Lanka where there's a history of sectarian violence
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:17.020]   Similar to the tradition in US where you can't go on a movie theater and yell fire because it creates imminent harm
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:22.980]   The principles that we have on what we remove from the service that are if it's going to result in real harm real physical harm
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.980]   And by the way, this is the law of the United States as well
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.020]   You know you can say anything you want but as soon as you threaten somebody with physical harm if they're in fear
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.300]   That's not protected speech, right? If you're taking individuals then that content shouldn't be on the platform
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.940]   There's a lot of categories that we can get into but there's a broad debate. So
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:43.940]   Cara says, okay Sandy Hook didn't happen. It's not a debate. That's false. You can't just take that down
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.420]   Mark says well, I agree. It's false
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.460]   I also think that going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling him hey
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.780]   No, you're a liar that is harassment. Well, we will take that down
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:58.060]   But he doesn't mention we won't take the sandy falls down. I'm Jewish
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.700]   There's a set of people who denied that the Holocaust happened. He brought it up
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.900]   I find that deeply offensive but at the end of the day, I don't believe our platform should take that down
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:11.580]   Because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don't think that they're intentionally getting it wrong
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:18.380]   That's the problem. That's what so far off. Yes, of course all the cost tonight is getting intentionally wrong
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:23.660]   Well, it's Cara says that he says well, it's hard to impugen intent to understand the intent I
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:30.020]   Which is him talking about scale really. Yeah, he's talking about the degree of difficulty of the task
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.580]   What he's trying because he's matching two different things here. What is the question of principles on what principle?
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.140]   So there's a lot of discussion last week and there was a press there was press stories
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:43.500]   And I'm sure you probably saw them or maybe already discussed them about info wars and you have people saying press people saying
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:48.060]   Why don't you just take info wars off of Facebook and off of YouTube and an anecdotal level?
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.260]   I agree
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:55.020]   But at a principle level you can't do that until you set the principle that says what's the ongoing?
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:03.340]   Enforceable scalable principle that you are proposing for what gets taken down and what does not well said Jeff
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.380]   That's exactly the problem and and it's a it's a sticky problem for sure
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:13.540]   I agree, but we got to all be it on the stickiness here. Does this come down to whether they're a publisher or a platform?
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.980]   Right related to that issue that is exactly in your up as but
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:24.540]   I mean it is do you want to neutrally host everything platform or do you want to exercise judgment and
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.100]   Judgment implies values it has to I
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:34.780]   I think you can you can still have values and you can still you can be a platform and you can still make decisions and
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.580]   So it's a platform doesn't mean you take everything
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:44.260]   What makes a difference about you what types of quality or the types of content because that is yeah
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.820]   That's not that's not the definition of publisher. That's not the definition of media to me
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:54.020]   And we in media tend to look at the world Godlike and keep on thinking it's about us
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.020]   I had this I had this argument on Twitter today with Christopher Mims from the Wall Street Journal
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.220]   Well, it's media and that's content and I said no, it's neither
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:07.100]   It's not media and and for that matter. It is not content. It is conversation and that is different
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.900]   And so you know, I think we keep on trying to put these new pegs in our old holes
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.980]   So you're saying we've got platform
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:22.440]   Conversation and then publisher. Yes, I'm saying no
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.900]   I'm saying we have old definitions and old concepts of
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.460]   Publisher and platform
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:34.140]   Whether that platform is a phone cover whatever and I'm saying these things are something new. Yeah, we don't fully understand
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.500]   conversation
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.940]   So I'm going to be then about okay, so then let's talk about conversation and
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.700]   what the rules of quote-unquote conversation are
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.580]   If if you are
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:54.420]   Because Facebook is not are you saying Facebook's in on this conversation and part of the conversation because of its role is a
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:34:00.180]   Platform for hosting it not in that old definition, but just because that's the question that I think we should figure out
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.460]   I mean, let's go into a bar Stacy right. We're a bar
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:10.580]   Okay, and in a bar you have the right to refuse service to someone like oh, I don't know Sarah's Andrews
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.780]   right and
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:17.740]   You can refuse to service for various reasons right Facebook has the right to refuse service to people
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:25.220]   Google has the right Twitter has the right to just say we don't like this for whatever reason they have same reason that a bar
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:31.940]   And now in this country a baker can refuse service does that make them so less of a platform and more of a publisher?
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:38.260]   No, that's a conversation place. It makes them something new and differently
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:42.740]   Oh, that's that's the issue we keep on trying to find the analogs to a world of 50 and 100 years ago
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.180]   And this is something new and we don't appreciate it
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:49.940]   We in media keep on trying to define things in our images if we're God so let's let people want to be up
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.740]   Yeah, so let me confuse things further
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:58.020]   So so we're talking about whether they throw info wars off or don't throw info wars off their solution actually their solution
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.540]   air quotes is
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:05.340]   They're gonna sort of deprioritize down rank. Yeah, so what's the deal with that? So they can just let me
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.340]   Let me go into that Mike and let me first do a caveat do a disclosure
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.460]   important for every show where this comes up is that I
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:17.980]   Raised money from Facebook, Craig Newmark Ford Foundation and others to work on these issues at News Integrity Initiative
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:22.180]   And I haven't announced anything yet, but I'm also gonna be doing a new project here where Mike
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.940]   I'm gonna work on exactly that question. So let me just give a second background on this
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:32.540]   What I learned from Facebook and we have a group of people of product development people in the news business
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:37.060]   We had and we had a Facebook person in about a year ago and we asked that person
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.980]   What's news at Facebook? How do you define news?
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.620]   And it was fascinating because the definition came back
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:50.420]   Well, there's social content and there is public content period and public content was one big
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:54.500]   Bucket that included everything that wasn't created on Facebook or wasn't social
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:36:01.100]   So the New York Times and the Washington Post and Vladimir's line blog were all in the same bucket and Facebook had no concept
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:06.500]   No variation of definition or of quality in all of that. So when Vlad got him in trouble
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:10.060]   That's when they downranked and pushed off basically all public content
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.060]   So now what they're saying is we're gonna bring back
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:17.700]   To prominence quality content quality news content, but they don't really know what news is there
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.300]   What quality is and so I'm working on a project not just for Facebook
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:27.500]   But for Google Twitter at agencies and so on to try to aggregate the signals of quality and lack thereof
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.300]   so that they can make more informed decisions and
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:37.180]   We do have the platforms just choosing to make decisions Google has said they account for the reliability authority and quality of sources and search
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.780]   Twitter is accounting for the quality of the public conversation
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.260]   Facebook is now accounting for the quality of news sources, but they don't know how to do it
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:48.620]   They don't know what's there and we got to help them. So Mike back to the question
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.140]   There's there's basically three things that Facebook can do four things
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:59.380]   What is that they can kick you off you are you are abhorrent and we kick you off and there is some there are some things that meet that
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:04.780]   Test but very few they can downrank that is to say that they don't promote it if Leo shares it with you
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.340]   You'll probably see it, but Leo's your friends won't see it number three
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:16.740]   They can forbid you to get monetization either by by by by receiving ad revenue or by placing ads and then four
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.300]   That was it. That's four right kick you off
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:25.380]   Downrank you oh and then four is they can put up notice is to the user
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.740]   That that give indication about this site. Hey all of our fact checkers said this is bunk
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.780]   You want to look at it? Okay, but watch out. It's bunk. So those are the tools that they have at hand
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:41.380]   Then the question becomes this this is a lovely those are good distinctions
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:48.980]   But then you're not really describing a bar nor a conversation because of power imbalance and
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.020]   True true. So so I feel like
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.100]   We still either a don't have the right vocabulary
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.540]   Or they still look a lot like a publisher and then I think I think we don't have the right vocabulary space
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.540]   Yeah, I think I think the fact that you're open to that idea
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:11.060]   Is key here? That's why we have to try to because we using the old analogies doesn't really work and bar doesn't work either my grand
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.020]   Well, so because the big challenge here is facebook is
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:18.980]   Their goal isn't to be a bar because no bar wants to be or no
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.980]   No current
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:27.220]   conversational hub aims to be the place for every single conversation in the way that facebook
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.860]   It's their goal and it's their goal
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:37.300]   You know because they're actually creating a marketplace for users to like find and advertise to people, right? That's their actual goal
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.060]   so
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:45.380]   We've got to break that down because you can't be a home for conversation, but then trying to sell that conversation
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.460]   That's kind of like trying to say
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.500]   Who says you can
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.180]   New bottle
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.340]   Under what? Should be the rule that says you can't do that
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:39:01.060]   It feels icky, which is not a new which is not that kind of is a bar actually
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:06.900]   Right that literally is a bar. Yeah, because they're selling the booze the difference the difference is that imagine
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:12.180]   If mark Zuckerberg actually did own a bar he would and he ran it like facebook
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.020]   You can place that would be
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.980]   Who gets to sit with whom who gets to say what who gets to hear what he would control it literally everything
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:26.660]   This is the thing that he would also control the ability for people who want to sell different types of cocktails to people
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:31.780]   Access to that right that well i think let's not over stretch the bar now
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.100]   Obviously it's snappy
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.940]   Why don't you pop up that bump?
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.780]   I think it's not unreasonable to say well
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.540]   Maybe there is this something besides publisher and platform that facebook is
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.340]   And I think you if mark says
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.660]   We have a rule
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.260]   The rule is as long as you don't promote harm to another person
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:52.980]   Even if what you say is false
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:40:00.820]   We're gonna allow it but that's bs because here's the thing that we should be talking about facebook wants to control what your relationships are
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.540]   Who hears what i mean jeff says that okay info wars
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:09.220]   He gave the example that if you were deprioritized and you posted something maybe i would see it but nobody else will see it
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:15.620]   That's not exactly how it works even the most innocuous thing only goes to like 10 or 12 or 13 percent who knows nobody knows
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.700]   Nobody knows who sees one of the new and one of the reasons mark's making this pr tour
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:24.980]   He also did some interviews with cnn another tractors again is because sandy hook's parents
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.620]   Are suing alex?
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.700]   Jones of info wars
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:37.540]   And that some this is also bled into the facebook presence because both are on facebook for lying so there is harm
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:41.860]   If a pub if somebody in a conversation on facebook says
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:48.660]   Oh sandy hook never happened those people who say their kids were shot are actors
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.420]   And they're pursuing a political agenda. Well that seems to me harmful
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:58.260]   But if it's not true again but again the thing that the reason we have to have these complicated conversations is because facebook
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:03.860]   We're accepting that facebook must be in control of everything where we should be arguing for
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.860]   Is a more twitter like thing where the user is in control
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.940]   There's all kinds of really objectionable things on twitter you could do that like you can do that right now
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:16.660]   And it's a crappy user experience. Yeah, they we should be pushing them to make it a good user experience
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.060]   If you go there and say that they are they are
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.580]   I try to find the things like in prior tutorials that that's exactly what they're doing
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:27.540]   But but the community there should be no community guidelines anything should go on facebook if you want anything
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.820]   And if you say oh, I don't want to hear about holocaust and island. I want to want to hear
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:35.860]   Don't fake news and let's do something a little less loaded breastfeeding pictures. Yeah
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.780]   Why
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:44.420]   What now they don't anymore, right? I think they allow that now
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.460]   They do but it took it took a long time
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:52.260]   So how did where does it what's the harm where is the harm there jonathan zitrain
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:58.580]   Of harvard has argued to facebook and i'm bit of the room when he's argued this that basically we should all get a
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:03.620]   You know some some dials. Yeah, and that if we want to watch nothing but alex jones
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.300]   That make up make up my choice and my responsibility. I agree with that
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.260]   Right. I but I here's right and I see the point and I get it
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.780]   Um, and that's going more to the full platform side
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.460]   But I also see that as look at all the pressure facebook's under
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:22.260]   Uh, there are things that occur on its brand
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.020]   That they they either host or promote
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:31.860]   That have an impact and I think they have a right to say as a publisher does if you want to go to the publisher end
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:37.300]   Um, whether or not to have that the kind of pressure they're under is just you can't win
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:43.860]   Which is where it goes. So I if you go leo the congress on facebook and the net. It's a it's a twitter
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.300]   thread about facebook
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:51.540]   Um, it shows you the kind of so when when the other reason I think it's not going to be out there is because they tell
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.460]   I had testimony before congress once again
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:58.260]   And the kind of pressure on them is ridiculous from each end
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.260]   So you have
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:05.620]   One member of congress say and you have the the what's the diamond and silicon diamond silk, right?
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.260]   So you have steve king
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.220]   Why doesn't the gateway pun to get more traffic? You should be giving them more traffic
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.300]   This is bandy. Don't give them more traffic, right?
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.420]   And then they say that lemara smith accuses google of blocking all searches for jesus
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.820]   chick fillet and the catholic religion
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.700]   um
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.140]   And then you have
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:30.100]   Ted doh say why is is is is alex jones and in full wars on youtube at all?
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.900]   Um, and then you have
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:38.500]   Ted poh representative denounces snoop snoops a left wing organization, right?
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.220]   That's so what they're trying to say is f you all
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:45.060]   Right and leo's right. We're gonna put a put a standard
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.820]   I don't like what the standard is myself personally the standard is going to be as you said leo
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.620]   Yeah, if you're trying to harm people then we'll take that down
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.420]   But there's a big issue because I think it is harmful to people to say your kid wasn't shot
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.900]   Right. So define harm it's the issue exactly
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.100]   I agree with the fun
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.100]   And I think info wars harms democracy
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.340]   And I think that you can't be neutral anymore and you have to make some decisions here
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:12.020]   But you would support one person saying such horrible things in a barbershop in some small town to another person
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.340]   They have the right to do that
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.340]   If I were the barber
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.220]   I had someone in my office just this week
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.100]   So how about a stick that I found rather abhorrent
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:27.300]   About israel and palestine. Yeah, and I didn't kick that person out, but I said
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.020]   I'm not going to choose to deal with that person
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.260]   Um, that's my that's why right. That's my choice
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:39.940]   Right. I have a zero sympathy for the pressure facebook is under they don't have to make 40 billion dollars a year
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:45.380]   There's nobody says why are we all cheering for them to be just the most dominant powerful thing in history of mankind
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:50.500]   They should give up control and we users should be demanding control and and and stop
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.740]   Twishing ourselves and not trying to make sure that facebook has all the money all the control and all the users
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.620]   I mean, I the only control
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.780]   Which I have asserted is to leave facebook
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.140]   Is there an intermediate where I could stay on facebook and have more control?
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.700]   You want it to be more like google plus you can you can turn things off you can unfollow people
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.300]   You can hide all that they have all these controls, but what you can't do is say yeah
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.620]   I want to see I want to see
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:19.700]   Things that violate the community standards why are there community standards and whose community is this I am my own community
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.100]   uh, mike mike whoa, whoa
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.100]   um
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:30.100]   Why are there community standards because we because we're screaming about how we're living in a horrible uncivil world right now
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.060]   And there is some level responsibility that these platforms have
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:41.620]   Justice bars because facebook's algorithm which controls everything is designed to make people glued and addicted to their screens
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.020]   Now they have said they have said they have said for example that yes
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:52.180]   You should be more that we will get you to watch dumb cat videos and now they say we are going to instead emphasize
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:59.780]   um meaningful interactions between people so they've changed that as a strategy and don't forget mike that media's
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:07.700]   Model is exactly what you just described. Yeah media invented that model media created clickbait media wanted to glue you to everything
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:13.540]   Media wants to addict you so at age just facebook folks. It's our business too part of the problem is that facebook wants to be the internet
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:20.100]   We would all agree that there shouldn't there's nobody running the internet saying take that down put that up
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:26.500]   Yeah, and I think some of this problem is that facebook wants to become your internet and for many people it is
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.300]   I had a
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.900]   Caller on the radio shows told me that she got all of her news from facebook
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:35.700]   Yeah, and I said well you have to stop doing that and I suggested some alternate sources
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.580]   But if but for many people facebook is their internet
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:44.020]   So is that especially I mean we wouldn't tell we wouldn't say hey mister if there is there is an
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.900]   Yeah, there is an issue of confusing
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.660]   public content with personal content in some ways
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:57.060]   And we do this in the real world not just in the in the fake world in the inner on the internet
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:00.740]   So we call our aunt Susie and some of us are like, you know, why
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.260]   There are people in my family who will take anecdotal evidence from their friends as being
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.140]   far superior to
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:14.900]   actual fact-based proof and facts. So I had someone explain to me why baldness actually
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:21.140]   Was transmitted over the the father side if your father was bald you're gonna be bald and I tried to explain how jade
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.820]   So I think there's
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.620]   That gets you have a luncheon state. So you're probably gonna lose that too
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:33.300]   I did I lost that I actually lost that battle and you know, I was like, okay, that's cool. That's fine
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.700]   But that's a fairly harmless
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.340]   It is so that's that's the thing. I think it's simple
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:43.700]   Deciding that I think it's silly that facebook's trying to make this distinction
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.780]   I think it serves its own ends
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:52.020]   In a way that's probably not helpful because given the scale and there was actually a really good article in wired
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:58.020]   Um a couple weeks ago. It's called the complexity of simply searching for medical advice. Oh wow. That was so good
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:05.780]   Yes, yeah, you know, they talk about this data void and this this they bring up an example on facebook of people searching for vitamin k shots
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.860]   for their newborns and
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:13.460]   If you search for that on facebook, so basically if you're calling your friends and family like you might do to say hey
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.780]   They want me to do this. Did you guys do this?
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:20.180]   um what they got was a lot of information from anti-vaxxers and
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:26.260]   Yes, somebody didn't get their shot and somebody's baby died and that is a tragedy that did not have to happen
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.460]   and so that's an example where
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.620]   You know
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:38.100]   Did facebook cause this harm wired calls it the data void? Oh, no, sorry someone it it bing calls it the data void
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:45.060]   Wired talks about the asymmetry asymmetry of passion here. So yes people doctors who are
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:50.660]   Fact-based aren't doing a lot of posts on the value of vitamin k for infants
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:54.260]   But people who think it's killing their infants are posting a lot
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:49:01.380]   And that unfortunately gives a higher weight on the internet, which is a larger problem in society as well
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:07.700]   Of trusting science. That's the problem with stasis conversation as the person she was talking to wouldn't trust science
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:13.540]   I don't think that's actually the issue. I think I mean, yes, that is a issue, but I think the big issue is
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:21.460]   These companies make it really easy to find things that someone really cares about promoting. So there is it
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.220]   Alex Jones doesn't just put his crazy ideas out there
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:28.660]   He actively promotes them in a variety of different ways
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:34.340]   Whereas the rest of us are like a ignoring it because it's crazy to think that sandyhood never happened
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.380]   Why would we ever think that in or be
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:41.620]   There's only 20 parents who are really passionate about you know
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:48.340]   Trying to change this and promote it and they're kind of hobbled because they're like by the ideals of common decency and
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:56.820]   That's that's I think a bigger issue that all of these things happen and that's something that facebook isn't talking about nor is google
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:01.220]   Okay, so what do you know way where you were say you were saying why do you suggest?
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.660]   What is the solution then to that? What's what's the solution?
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:11.060]   Is to start realizing so I think that's it's a bigger solution across all of technology
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:15.540]   Especially as we move into ai it's this idea of understanding
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.340]   adversaries so
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:19.540]   understanding
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.540]   who wants to
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:27.220]   Who wants to promote different ideas understanding that there are going to be two or multiple sides to anything
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:31.540]   And some of them are not wrong, which means you do have to say the holocaust didn't happen
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.580]   Right. Oh, sorry. Sorry that the holocaust happened
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:38.100]   Because they happened
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:44.660]   The real stacey has made that decision right so google says you should be able to find the holocaust denier because they're out there
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.300]   But if you ask is the holocaust real the answer is yes
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:53.380]   And I said I talked about the show in the past if you now ask is is climate change real you're going to get science back
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:58.660]   Not conspiracy theories first. So google's made that decision. They saw I asked them correctly
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.740]   This means you're siding with science and they said yes
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:06.260]   I think facebook actually has to do that in times where in in in cases
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.980]   where there is actual like
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.220]   We know sandy hook happened
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:15.300]   There's no freaking doubt about that and facebook should have some sort of disclaimer at night or
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:20.980]   Shouldn't show it at all. I mean so stacey. Here's the here's the here's here's your here's your probe that for a second
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:25.860]   So this is where we're getting to the difference though in your view of publisher and platform blah blah blah
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:31.300]   A key difference here and what we just talked about is the google deals with information whereas facebook deals with people
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.420]   And that's what makes me so complicated
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:38.020]   There's another distinction google search doesn't
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:44.980]   Filter it ranks and facebook. That's exactly what facebook does facebook right? It's all there right
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:49.940]   You kept going all day. You would see it all it is ranked. I I've tried
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:54.020]   I can't see it all I go to I go to the facebook newsfeed and I go through and I see these
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:58.180]   You know from like five people and then I go the next day and it's the same post I saw yesterday
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:02.020]   And if you keep going and going and going and going and going this is what they've said
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.940]   I've been in ruse with the people who have been asked
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.340]   They are ranking
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.620]   And then if you kept clicking next next next next next next yeah
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:14.740]   You would eventually see it all or you can go to the feed where you see it all the other differences that you're ranking
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.340]   You can't search
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:20.420]   Facebook for content and get heavy results rapid search on earth
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:26.900]   It's it's deliberate is obviously deliberate. They don't want people searching facebook on google
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:33.380]   Theoretically you search for some question. You see the you see the facebook doesn't want you to search
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:39.220]   No, why does not because that that's a way to actually use facebook in a way that isn't mediated by facebook
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:44.580]   But say facebook isn't a search engine though like it's it's different and I think I would get they do have a search
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:48.260]   But they do have a search why yeah, but why shouldn't we demand that they
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.460]   It'd be awful
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.700]   But shouldn't we demand that face if facebook is supposed to be a source of information instead
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:54.660]   We're supposed to be just
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:53:01.140]   But but but who says who says who says it's supposed to be from source people get information from facebook people get more
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:06.660]   Yeah, more people get information from facebook than any newspaper any news publication, etc
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:09.060]   But let me finish the let me finish the point
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:15.220]   A news feed spoon feeds you stuff is like here. Here's here's a here's a crazy conspiracy theory
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.260]   It's like a company
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:21.780]   Whereas searching for something if I was saying well is that true and I should be able to search facebook and see all the perspectives that are on facebook
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:26.900]   But why aren't we upset that they deliberately prevent you from searching that they have a search bar
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:31.940]   They make you think there's search function twitter has a search function google plus has a perfect search
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:37.140]   All every place has a search because of facebook deliberately hobble search. Why aren't we upset about that?
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.500]   It's because it's not a content site and I think what you would get back in search
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:44.580]   Yeah, I'm too frustrated by the search but but when i'm looking for a person it's crappy search
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:48.260]   Try and find that why are they but taking that agency away from us
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:54.020]   I think the world's biggest source and see I think you're presuming it's something different than it's not
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:56.980]   You're trying to make facebook into google and it's not
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.460]   if
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.540]   Let's say let's say I think that mike's right because I think facebook wants to be the internet
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:07.140]   It doesn't want you to use google you can't link out of facebook point
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:10.660]   That's a book you have to live in facebook and that's facebook's goal
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.180]   I mean this is to your point also of them making 50 billion dollars a year
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.740]   They want to be the internet right?
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:18.260]   So
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.180]   I think if you're if you're going to make that your goal then it would behoove you
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:27.700]   To do some of the things that the internet does or google does for many people google the internet
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:32.020]   Right, so let's say let's say you you have a you run a podcast network say for example
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.020]   Just grab a
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.020]   Do that
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.780]   You're gonna get asked for mental illness and all that stuff
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:42.500]   But yeah, sure so somebody has a podcast network and let's say you want to find podcast enthusiasts
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:47.620]   Right, you go to twitter you search for a podcast fan. That's easy get all these people google plus google search
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.420]   You can go anywhere and find that you can't go to the internet face no way
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:56.180]   They are not gonna no you want to find the podcast fans you better pay the advertising money and they'll tell you exactly
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:00.900]   That's why they'll tell you exactly who the podcast fans you search for subject material
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:07.060]   You can search for anything if you pay for an ad and you do but I can't go to facebook and search for sandy hook
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.180]   You won't get anything usable at all
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.500]   I mean and you think that that's because they want you to pay for that capability
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:21.380]   They they want to control exactly what you know what you see who you connect with they want to control it all because that's where the money is
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:22.820]   That's what i'm saying
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.820]   So that is directly
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:30.020]   That is directly in opposition to the other thing they want which is to be the single and sole source
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:34.820]   Of information they they want it both ways you can't you shouldn't get you can't get both
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:39.140]   They what they really want is for you to spend all your as much time as possible on facebook
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:44.340]   They want you to spend as much money as possible on facebook and they want you to look at what they tell you to look at exactly
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:47.140]   And they want to know every is that not fair jeff
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:53.700]   That sounds like a fair characterization if i think i know i think leo your characterization before was better
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:59.700]   It's about it's about um, you know going outside of facebook i disagree with my characterization that facebook
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:03.460]   Facebook's goal is to be a source of information
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:09.380]   Facebook's goal is to be a place for conversation, which is my discussion with stacey and that changes
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:16.420]   I think that's their stated dynamics large goal is that you never leave facebook. Yeah period. Oh, that's for sure
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.500]   leo i'm agreeing with that
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:22.020]   But i'm not agreeing with the point that mike is making that
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:25.700]   Uh, the the basis of what they do is to be a source of information
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:30.740]   Yeah, i'm not saying that that's the basis of what they do, but i'm saying that in reality they are the
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.740]   second
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.820]   largest source of information site probably and
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:38.180]   They know that people are the source of information
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:42.740]   i'm just going to take issue a little bit with you mike here only because i just did it
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:45.700]   um, so i went on facebook and i searched for sandy hook
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.420]   and i got
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.860]   links to a variety of what like facebook pages one is a
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.540]   anti-gun effort one is the town itself
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.780]   um, and then
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:00.980]   Now related searches the top one is sandy hooks
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.620]   sandy hooks hoax
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.780]   The second one is sandy hooks summer concerts
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:12.500]   The third and this is just related sandy hook was a hoax and then sandy hook national park sandy hook beach
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:16.100]   So scrolling down i see post from friends
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:18.420]   I'm not seeing any of that
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:22.900]   So yeah, and that's part of the customization most of my friends will leave that same
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.220]   I'm sorry. I shouldn't even say believe most of my friends
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:30.980]   No sandy hook happened so they're very like hey gun violence is bad blah blah blah
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.740]   um
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.980]   The public posts are cnn
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.740]   um
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.740]   something about park rangers at sandy hook
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:44.900]   And a another cnn story about sandy hook victims filing a lawsuit against alix jones
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:47.780]   And then on the articles front
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:52.900]   Again, mark zuckerberg does not want to band holocaust deniers or sandy hook truthers
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:56.420]   So i don't actually see anything except for the related
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:03.780]   The related searches about sandy hook being a hoax you're getting you're right i don't say it either i don't either
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:08.980]   Yeah, you're getting the word sandy hook in in page titles and in hashtags
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:13.380]   But probably getting my friends the content of friends statements too
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:18.100]   i'm getting journalists talking about uh disagreeing with what zuckerberg said
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.900]   and uh
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:25.540]   And and decrying alix jones i'm just gonna say i love it that i can't play this game
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.300]   i'm not getting anything because i can't go on facebook
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:34.820]   And if i go to and this is an interesting thing i think if i google just sandy hook
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:40.020]   A couple stories down i actually get the sandy hook hoax by ny mag
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:44.740]   Right and that's actually not talking about it being a hoax it's talking about the people who think it was a hoax
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:51.860]   But then a couple stories down after that i get the sandy hook hoax theories explained from huff poe
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:58.020]   And what's happening is the news coverage of these hoaxers are driving up that concept in these searches
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:03.700]   So then what i'm doing is i'm it's actually taking these marginalized weird views of people
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:10.100]   And saying and making them somewhat legit because they i could click on that and some people are going to read that and be like
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.300]   Oh
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.580]   I never thought about that. What if that's actually true holy cow
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:19.060]   especially people who are inclined to believe more these things because
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:23.380]   They're promoting this is and they're not really promoting it as
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:30.580]   To to opposing viewpoints to legitimate opposing viewpoints, but that's what some people are going to look at it as
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:34.900]   I think it's not surprising that if you were going to design facebook
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:42.660]   Uh that maybe you wouldn't explicit explicitly you would say what zuckerberg says about connecting all the people in the world
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:43.540]   level block
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.540]   But what you would end up with is
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:50.820]   Something that is designed to be as sticky as possible to keep people inside of facebook
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:53.460]   looking at
[00:59:53.460 --> 01:00:00.580]   The newsfeed because that's where you could most reasonably monetize. Yeah, you i understand why search wouldn't be that good
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:05.540]   You really and i don't i never used search in facebook. I remember they promoted it for while to find things
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.820]   Yeah, but it would never really worked well and of course there's people
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.980]   Yeah, there's not really people i can't find people there's not much of an incentive for them to do that really
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.220]   And I don't think this was named even necessarily a conscious decision
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:22.980]   But if you want to be maximize the profitability and the success of a company of facebook
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:29.780]   You would say don't leave facebook have that be your only page. That's your internet have the news feed be the thing that
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:31.620]   feeds you
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:35.060]   Because that way we can feed you the most appropriate advertising
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:41.540]   Wheel monitor what you click on what you read what you spend time on so as to maximize that time spent
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:48.980]   It's a it's a it's a feedback loop that seems to work that whether you say we're about connecting the world's people or whatever
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:55.860]   That's what you would end up with right? Yeah, and despite all my complaining about facebook and does it very well
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:01.860]   It does it very well and I think we'll look back at this as kind of a golden era because we're facing some real problems in the future
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:05.460]   The first problem we're facing is you notice when facebook is facing the senate
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.740]   Hearings and all that kind of stuff
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:14.020]   Ultimately the only real solutions you provided it was oh we're gonna have ai take care of all of that
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:19.540]   Ai will take it so that's all secret behind the scenes. We're not gonna see ai right choosing
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:26.100]   It's just basically magic right and waving it's it's gonna put it under the rug and nobody will have access to what is being censored
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.580]   the other problem with google and all and serie and
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:37.300]   Virtual assistance is in the future if I ask serie or google assistant a question. It's gonna give me an answer
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.900]   I'm not gonna get
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.460]   100,000 results ranked. I'm gonna get the answer same problem
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:46.500]   It's a bigger problem because it's like wow so
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:50.580]   Somebody somebody's gonna be like what the answer is what the truth is. Yeah, which is
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:54.100]   Which is really a problem and I don't know how we're gonna solve it
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.980]   and you forgot a third problem mike which is
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.860]   Ai is still really bad at interpreting and applying
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:07.540]   Human common sense to inquiries in questions. I love how far we've come
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:13.300]   But there is a reason that you know ai is still laughably bad at a lot of
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.900]   interpretive
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.660]   Spots so before we get all freaked out about it. We actually have to make it decent
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.180]   So I think this would be a good time to have a class on one
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.180]   Yeah, we're yeah
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:30.340]   I need a drink. I gave you the perfect segue by doing the bar thing
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:34.180]   Yeah, right and you ignored it leo. Was that why you did that?
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.940]   I thought it was because yeah, remember we played this thing
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:44.820]   Was it from konan or one of the late night shows if facebook were a bar? Do you remember that video? Oh, I never saw that
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:49.860]   Oh, yeah, okay. Well, I'm talking about it was s and l it is it was s and l
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:53.940]   And it was it was exactly what facebook would be like if it were a bar
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:57.380]   The bar for the bartender pushing of course
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:02.820]   Right all of these theories that keep people in in there because nobody they don't want anybody to leave
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:08.660]   Uh, I don't think mark. I would you have to reading I by the way, uh kudos to kara swisher
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:14.660]   Good interview. She challenged him. She did as good a job as you can with a ceo
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.620]   She wears she wears sunglasses indoors, but she's a great interview
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:23.220]   I think she did a very good job and I think I would say based on that interview, which is at recode.com
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.780]   mark is not a evil or malicious person. Although if he you know, I
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:32.100]   Understand that one of the reasonable questions people might have is he's he's evil
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:37.380]   Does he have an agenda because if he did he has the the perfect evil genius power?
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:42.100]   Yeah to to promote whatever that agenda might be no no no no no he is evil
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.220]   He is evil because he doesn't understand his own privilege
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:50.580]   No, he doesn't want to understand and he doesn't people are privileged rarely understand
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:55.780]   Stacy we're seeing that that that you're you're you're in a time where we're seeing a lot of evil
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.260]   You're devaluing the term
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.500]   Okay, there's evil there. It's not evil, but I think it's I think it's irresponsible
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:06.340]   You might think it's your responsible and I think it's a difference
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:11.140]   I think it's reprehensible. There's got to be a good deal with you and personal choice
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:15.060]   How about their Leo choosing a wine you will here we go
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:20.420]   That's the segue I was looking for we're gonna talk about wink wink is awesome
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:28.420]   And I'm gonna open we just got our new wink box if you go to uh try wink t-r-y-w-i-n-c.com/twig
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:33.620]   You could take the wink taste profile test. It's kind of fun. Do you like uh?
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:38.980]   Salt in your food. You like coffee. How do you like your coffee? Do you like peppers? Do you like citrus?
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:43.620]   Anyway, take the test and then wink is gonna recommend some wines wink is
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:49.220]   Uh a wine maker. Okay, so uh what that means is they find great wines
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:55.460]   That they make from great grapes all over the world you choose how many reds how many whites we in our family Lisa
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:05:01.460]   Will not drink white wine. I don't know why I love white wine, but uh, you know that about us mike because we bring us red
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.060]   Yep, so so we did this you do the profile you subscribe
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:09.300]   Every month you're gonna get you can get more if you want, but the typical subscription
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.260]   Is a bottle a week for bonds?
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.260]   Maybe two you have with a meal
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.980]   One you put in your cellar for later
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.500]   Uh one you bring to friends when you go over there's nothing nicer by the way
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.500]   They're bringing a bottle of wink wine to friends because they have beautiful labels
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:28.580]   They're they're wines that are delicious. They're very drinkable
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.580]   And it's so fun every month
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.220]   When we get we just got our box today when we get our box
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.740]   We get a little uh, let there be wine delivered to your doorstep
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:41.300]   There's the envelope describing the wines lots of background information and let's see what we got
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:45.540]   This week in our wink box. Oh boy. I'm gonna put this down
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:49.940]   Uh, let's start with just at random
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:58.900]   Uh, that's a good label baseline baseline. It is from sanabarbra la and cantada vineyard. It's a 2016 pino
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:04.420]   Pick with conviction. That sounds delicious. Picked by convicts
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:11.140]   No, they do have some wines the field theory. There's a field theory with a um austrian
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:16.020]   A varietal that they pick in the middle of the night because they want the grapes to be cool
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:22.660]   Here's rogue admirals a charaz from australia. I'm a fan of australian charazes. Aren't you leo?
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:30.980]   Only australians say charaz. It's sura. It's a sura. Yes, but if you're in if you're down under it's a charaz
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:38.900]   Okay from the limestone couse product of australia dubbed the shipwreck coast if there be any a vessel failed and navigated savage shores
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:44.420]   South australia's limestone coastline has always been a fearful yet fertile land
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:53.380]   So wow, I can't wait to try that. I I like sera me too. Me too. And I like charaz. Well actually charaz is the original name the frankification is sera
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:57.940]   So it's it's originally from like lebanon. Oh, I sure yeah, it's it's like as an expert
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:03.060]   Yeah, it's a it's a uh from the lavant whatever least a loves pino. So we got two bottles of a baseline
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:08.900]   She is a we'll put one down and we'll have one for a dinner probably tonight baselines. Oh, look at this
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.220]   Vadir
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:15.460]   She's also a big fan of french wines and there's but remember this is abos jalet
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:24.740]   Uh from bojole latin y which is a particular appellation. It's a protected appellation, which means this is going to be pretty special
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.940]   Vadir which was that mean 20 gods
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.700]   Bojole
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.100]   30 30 no no 20 is van
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.900]   Vadir
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.900]   Vadir no, it's not good. Yeah, it's 20 gods
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:45.220]   I don't know what that means, but we'll find out they do great labels which make it a really wonderful house warming gift
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:50.660]   Wine started just 13 dollars a bottle shipping is included they go right to your door
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:58.100]   If you take the palette profile quiz that'll get you started but as you every month goes by you pick new delicious wines
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:02.500]   This summer of course you've got to try the insanely popular summer water rosé
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:06.340]   That is amazing and actually you could try paul tharats trip
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.580]   he likes to
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:12.420]   Turn rosé into slushies. He freezes them in slushies. Oh jeez
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:20.180]   Well, I was a can can lion's and they were had they had rosé slushies. It's the greatest ever he tharats like that's so believable
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:23.380]   Take a little some yeah take a rosé and make a slushie out of it
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:27.060]   Yeah, no water. Don't put water. No put ice in it heavens. No no
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:31.060]   It's strawberry puree and a lot of them. Oh well, you could do that. I guess if you were crazy
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.420]   That out there
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.780]   Shipping is covered if you ever don't like a bottle don't worry you don't have to send it back
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:40.740]   They'll just send you another one. No questions asked so sit back relax celebrate
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.980]   Enjoy the summer
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:47.780]   You'll enjoy the winter just as much why settle for the same bottle of wine you always get we get we all get wine ruts
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:51.700]   I'm always not a big wine rut and then along comes way
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:56.020]   Well, you go to you go to the store and you face the wall of wine and you're just so overwhelming
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.300]   You don't know what's going on and so you get the thing you know
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:04.820]   I like getting a different wine every time that's the beauty of wine is this is this variety of flavors
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:07.540]   They have a uh a summer food
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:14.100]   Oh, you can get uh, oh some blender stuff. There's some there's some other stuff in here
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:20.020]   This is great. There's a little coupon going in here. I like it try wink t r y w i n c dot com
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:27.700]   Slash twig. Oh did I mention 20 dollars off your first ship try wink dot com slash twig try wink
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.980]   dot com slash twig
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:38.260]   We're gonna have some wine. Should we get wine glasses? Would you like some this isn't as a corks this isn't as a screw cap
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:42.020]   Yes, sometimes it's up to the winemaker. I guess there are good reasons for screw caps. I'm
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:47.780]   This is the yellow wine. I'm gonna have wine brought to me. So okay, which one should we open?
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:54.740]   Um, you know you got two baselines here. We should that's probably why that's right. She knew my gels show. That's right
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:10:01.860]   A little Santa Barbara Pino. That's right. All right my hometown. All right. Is it Santa Barbara? Yeah, oh, I guess I knew that
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:04.660]   Yeah, that's pretty cool. The other wine country Colleen is here
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:08.740]   We need glasses and a corkscrew
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:17.700]   Isn't it nice to be the king? Uh, it's nice to be in studio. Sorry guys
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:22.980]   I am sad that I cannot try the wink wine, but I will be imbibing
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:27.940]   I I'm like oh after that facebook conversation. I know that was you're on kind of vacation
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:34.100]   Yeah, I am on vacation. I'm on this vacation. He is I get that's nice. Well, you'll you'll still write while you're there, right?
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:38.500]   Oh, I am ready. The newsletter will still go out Kevin and I recorded a show this morning
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:43.460]   See, this is why having a podcast is cool because you could do it anywhere internet school
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.980]   I like you so so when the sponsor Leo
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:51.460]   I was gonna go in a mock horror at the personalization of the wine taste thing
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:57.540]   Oh my god. They know what you might say. No, give it guess what we want. We'll be allowed in europe
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:03.140]   Uh the dispatch from super internet says mike elgin in computer world
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:08.020]   There is a much better internet than the one you're using wait a minute what?
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:14.100]   So jeff and I were arguing before the show started about who is the bigger fanboy of the pixel book
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:20.020]   Uh and he tried to pull the old i've been a fan longer than you have there from bigger fan
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:22.740]   So we both had the cr4
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:27.140]   We all had the cr48 probably. Yeah, who has been using them exclusively?
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:34.900]   Exclusively I've been using this exclusively for two and a half months. How about that? So here's the you were I patty for a while
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.900]   I was I was and macbook proe
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:42.820]   Late to the party. I took my macbook pro perfectly good as 2015
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.740]   Which is the last good one and I just tossed it aside and I've been using this full time
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.260]   So here's the benefit that nobody talks about everybody talks about security
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.700]   Unconvenience and the fact it's in the cloud and nowadays with android support
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:57.540]   Yeah, it's like it's great and I've made the point in a column that now
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:02.020]   Current the pixel the chrome book platform the pixel book platform
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:04.500]   uh has gone from being the
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:09.300]   The platform that has the runs the least number of apps to the platform that runs more apps than any
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:16.180]   History so you've got chrome extensions. You've got android and now i'm really excited about crostini
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:20.660]   I can run my Linux there are two ways around the Linux you can run it through through through the to the
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.540]   Well, anyway, there's there's that's that and make sure it's not
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:28.980]   I'm sure it's not but wait. This is the tradition of wine, right? You have to open it up taste it
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:36.900]   Wow, that's fantastic. All right, baby. And believe me even though it's an advertiser. I'm gonna give you a least of four
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:44.580]   So so here's the benefit. Nobody stays here. Just one second. Like instead of your your boxing glove. I know what a scrawl
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.740]   Yeah
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:52.660]   There you go. There you go. Nice color. So here's the benefit that nobody talks enough about so
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:58.500]   Chrome is great chrome extensions are great the problem with chrome is just clobbers your performance is good
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.740]   Isn't that it's a big bold thing. It's like delicious
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:06.340]   It clobbers your performance and now with the with the with the with the new edition of isolating
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:11.620]   Um each process within chrome the performance is even worse in chrome 10 percent
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:15.220]   Yeah, but it's more safe. It's more safe and the security is fantastic
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:20.820]   But with a pixel book and I have and whether it's the you know, the eight gig or the 16 gig pixel book
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.980]   You are what people don't realize is you are free from those
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:28.180]   Problems I open 60 tabs at once
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:33.700]   Without any significant performance. Why what but I don't understand. What is it that makes a chrome?
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:41.140]   Stacey's got a headache for you. I and I and I run I run 50 60 70 simultaneous extensions
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.220]   So I don't understand what it's doing. It's so it's just Linux
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:49.540]   It's a it's a it's a high powered laptop running a low low low powered opera
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:52.740]   Oh, you're saying the pixel book that's the pixel book is hard
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:57.540]   So in my version of the internet by the way, they had a pretty good deal on pixel books on that
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:04.500]   Amazon prime day 250 off. Yeah in my version of the internet the the internet that I use I don't use passwords
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.260]   I don't have tracking every time I put in a a password
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.340]   where
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:14.980]   That has been compromised and is posted on blackboard web. It says oh, they don't use that password anymore
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:19.220]   That's out there chrome does that chrome extensions do that. Oh, I see okay
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.900]   So the point is it's an a subtle point and I think it's a very important point
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:28.580]   Anyone who runs chrome on safari windows, whatever can use any of the extensions
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:37.140]   But only pixel book users can run all the extensions and when you run all the extent for example, I have probably 20 extensions that affect gmail
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:41.780]   Wow, I can send SMS I can I can I can send mail merge
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.900]   Have you published anywhere your list of recommended extensions?
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.900]   I really should do that and and I think but I think it's a really powerful thing
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:52.500]   But but literally pixel book and pretty soon about 15 or 20
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.140]   Chromebooks will be powerful enough to run all this stuff
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:00.420]   But when you make an excellent point which is that basically a hardware designer manufacturer apple micro stuff
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.620]   Whoever?
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:07.140]   Optimizes the os for the tasks they expect to be done right so the iPad is optimized for certain things the iPhone
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:13.140]   You're saying that the pixel book is optimized actually chrome always optimized for lower power seats
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:17.540]   It's optimized for the internet not apps not all the stuff just just the internet
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:24.500]   I've I've been using computers since the 80s and every computer I've ever had no matter how much I've spent
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.100]   It's always like it's too slow. I want it fast. I'm a speed freak, right?
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:33.700]   It's always too slow. This is the first device I've ever had where I don't say that it's fast
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:39.220]   Yes, fast fast fast. I mean, it's like so fast. Did you get the base model? No, I got the
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:45.460]   I got the most expensive a version of the least expensive computing platform there is
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:49.060]   It's basically 2k when I was done with the case and that this and that
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:54.900]   But that's what you'd spend so happy. Yeah, and if that's optimized for what you do, right?
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.020]   That's the one that's right and just here's an here's an example
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:02.100]   So I run I run an extension that takes away all the tracking
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:09.780]   It improves the speed by 43 percent. No, what's which one is it? Uh, ghost a rear. It's yeah, it's one of those
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:12.660]   Let's see. I got it right here in my files
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:18.980]   Uh, I want a I want a list of all your extensions because actually I agree with you and I said it to kevin for is about chrome
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.540]   Yeah, oh, yeah kevin you should you should talk to kevin's called disconnect
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:26.820]   It's called disconnect and that'll disconnect will also run on your android phone and your ios phone your iphone
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.860]   so
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.780]   Anyway, the point is that
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.780]   if you if you you're free
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:38.020]   To go and run many many many extensions and when you do the right extensions you're in another world
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:41.700]   You're in a better internet all the complaints people over the internet. There's too much tracking
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:47.300]   There's an extension for that password blah blah blah you can get rid of every complaint you have about the internet
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:52.980]   All at the same time if you run enough extensions. I'm thinking I should buy an upgraded chrome book
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:58.500]   I was confused about your column like I read it and I was like tell me more about this suppose
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:01.860]   It's super internet and I think it's because I was looking for a macro theme that would affect everything
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:06.580]   But what you're really just talking about is this optimization around
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:10.020]   Chrome and the pixel book and what google's doing for fuchsia
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:16.180]   Well, I know I fuchsia is not part of the internet how it operates. Yeah, so here's the so
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:22.740]   Just from my own personal experience. I've been using a macbook pro and have a user of chrome and every time I'd add an extension
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:25.940]   I'd be like, okay. I got a d commission another extension because it's like
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:29.940]   It not just slows down the browser slows down everything. It's just really bad
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:36.260]   And when I moved to the pixel book, I just quadrupled the number of extensions and with no performance penalty at all
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:44.180]   Okay, so then you're talking about basically an internet that's customized towards you around extensions, which is your super internet
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.420]   Here's the operating system that's optimized for the internet
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:52.420]   Here's the confusing part. So I mentioned fuchsia in the column and here's what I was the point I was making
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:56.820]   In the future with fuchsia and probably other operating systems. I'm talking 10 years from now
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:02.260]   You won't have apps that contain features. You'll have features that apply to all the apps
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:07.300]   Features will be separated from it. Yes, and that's what extensions do
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:13.540]   Extensions take features and they apply it to everything. So for example, that's interesting. That's a deep perspective. Yeah
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:18.500]   So so for example, I have this I have so websites don't just reveal all the all the web addresses
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:22.900]   On this show I one of my picks of the week of a couple months ago was hunter
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:27.620]   Which you go to any website and I'll tell you all the web email addresses associated with that website
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:33.220]   That's a feature, but it's not a feature of one site. It's a feature of every site
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.940]   It's a feature that's applied across everything
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:44.260]   And this is this is the this is why chrome extensions are kind of a glimpse into the future of all operating systems where features are separated from apps
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:49.300]   And this is one of the reasons why the whole internet is transformed if you use enough chrome extensions
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.460]   Nobody has any respect for chrome extensions
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:58.740]   Because it's a problem because of the performance issues, but again on the pixel book and pretty soon a dozen or 20
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:04.420]   Uh high-end uh chromebooks will be able to run many many chrome extensions are there more
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:10.500]   High-end or they're coming. Yeah equivalence. Yes. Yeah, there are many 1649 if you max that out with an i7
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:17.060]   A 512 gig hard drive. Do you use the hard drive at all though? Um, I guess the extensions live there but documents
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:21.940]   I I have like I have like 480 gigs free. Yeah, something like that
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:25.860]   Because I use you know what I use it for is I download movies and shows
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.940]   So I use netflix and showtime
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:33.140]   And google play and all of that and and uh, this is my tablet as well
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:36.180]   Yeah, um, so I used to carry it kind of it, you know
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:39.700]   Both in a sense and now I just flip it over when they yell at me on the airplane
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.220]   Turn off your laptop. I just flip it around and it's now a tablet
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:47.140]   Um, yeah, y'all and me and I watch a show how funny. So that's where I'm using them
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:48.580]   Are you allowed to do that?
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:53.220]   They tell you any device below a certain number of inches is what the last couple flights
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:57.460]   I've been on they're like any small computing device. They're wise to that trip
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:58.660]   intervention
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:03.940]   Here's another people would scream if they have the large tablet knows the tablet as well as they don't see the keyboard
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:06.420]   They're fun, but here's another thing that's this amazing
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:10.660]   So you can run mobile apps full-screen on a laptop for example. I love snap seed
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.300]   Yeah, right, but I run it full-screen
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:16.900]   Because it's an Android has an answer on that and because it's from google
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.140]   They've optimized a lot of ads are not optimized for years
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:24.820]   But a lot of them are a lot of apps are on full-screen and it's so good because sometimes mobile apps are the best thing out there
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.140]   We should have had so much on this show. You would be so happy. I know
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.100]   Yeah, one problem
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.940]   is that uh
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:36.500]   Netflix and often uh, amazon video
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.060]   Do not run well. They get confused
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:42.020]   Uh, it's not optimized well for your own
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:48.340]   You gotta blame the real problem still whereas you know google play is optimized for it and what operates beautifully
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:57.380]   But showtime netflix and and android stuff is really difficult to have to restart often to get it going or it gets confused
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:04.740]   Uh, that's that's the only problem I have there. There are other google apps that are not optimized for the pixel book and do not even run
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:10.100]   Uh, the washing post and there are other problems. I mean the macbook pro the fit and finish and the
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.820]   Uh, all that stuff is superior for sure and the
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:20.660]   The the pixel books performance is kind of a mixed bag. It's everything's on a hair trigger
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:26.500]   Like you think about touching a key and all of a sudden you see the letter on your skin like I didn't even and so that's
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:32.340]   Actually mike. It knows what you're going to type. Yeah, you've witnessed the next internet and the next google
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:39.140]   Yeah, exactly. That's right telepathy. You just don't know. Yeah, but anyway, my my point is that people talk about
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:47.300]   Um, you know that the pixel book is uh inadequate because it's not a business machine like windows windows is optimized for business
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:49.940]   It's not a content creation machine like a mac
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:56.180]   Um, the max are optimized for content. How about the internet is the internet important because this machine is optimized for the internet
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.500]   I would agree with you on that actually well
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:03.140]   I think it's optimized for business too if you look at the grab and grow program the google's pushing it's on the rundown
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:08.180]   Yeah, it's kind of fascinating. It's your your hotel. I'm not just your desk your hotel in your computer
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:15.620]   And you just go in and pick out a crow book who cares what crow book it is. Yeah, I do like it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Right. Yeah
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:18.740]   I had uh, I did a
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:25.860]   Sis of one of my favorite horror stories in businesses that I I did a presentation once at this executive of a major company
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:32.420]   I won't mention and he had his he was in the middle of an acquisition and had all the details locally on his hard drive
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:37.700]   On his laptop and it but he was like holding on to it. It was it was he wouldn't check it
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:43.940]   You know he carried it on cuff bracelets and the the airline lost his carry on luggage
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:47.140]   How let that sink in for a second
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:50.580]   They there was no room in the overhead compartment. They said don't worry. We'll take it for you
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:54.100]   Yeah, he never saw it again and the whole time we're doing this this presentation
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:57.940]   He was like distracted he's sitting there going. Oh my god. What have I done? His career was over
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:03.780]   He had I mean so this grab and go is an example of the fact that so act doesn't matter what happens to the hardware
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:07.940]   They have uh google employees can go up to a kiosk
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:11.380]   And they just take a fully charged Chromebook
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:14.580]   And they walk into it. It's got everything on it
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:19.540]   It's it's their chrome book then they bring it back. It erases it and they're done
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:23.380]   And and they're extending this to the to the world. So this has been there
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:24.500]   Are they now like companies?
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.060]   I remember when they were for education when they were pushing Chromebooks
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:31.700]   They were a little kiosk is the airport you could borrow a Chromebook and then get off the plane which is a great idea
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:35.620]   I wish they would share that essentially this is a program that's been dog-fooded in google
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:40.100]   Where else are you gonna see this enterprises? It's it's now a program that they're rolling out to enterprises
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:46.900]   Have you seen like the the HPX2 which is the separable screen? Yeah, yeah
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:50.420]   I have the windows version of that and and it's nice
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:55.460]   But but you know the problem is that is what Mike's saying about about the level of of hardware
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:59.620]   It only goes to four four gigs on it and I want at least eight if not 12
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:02.820]   So I can run the 60 tabs and not as many as that stays here don't worry
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.580]   um
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.020]   And um
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:11.940]   So so we need more competition at the high end of this everybody thought the world the google was crazy making a high end machine
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:16.100]   Yeah, and I think that and I'm seeing all the tech guys now all coming late to the party saying
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:21.940]   This is why you can actually give up your mac and this is no boy. The Chromebooks actually okay
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:25.700]   What's funny is a lot of of burning bush late
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:30.900]   Conversion to my religion. I yeah well within a year or two
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.260]   uh
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:37.140]   Mac OS and iOS are the only platforms that won't run on the on the pixel book flawlessly
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:40.580]   I mean you will run windows you'll run Linux you'll run all this stuff android
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:43.060]   uh, and it's just gonna be
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:45.060]   in virtual session or
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:48.260]   In virtual is it well in the case of lennox school is working on it
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:53.940]   I've been using that and I really like command line only but it does help me a lot because I can run some basic programs that I really
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:58.020]   There's an enormous amount of energy around around making these things work at high performance
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:00.260]   The idea of putting windows on this just makes me feel ill
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:03.540]   My friend build first an idea lab buys a top
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:06.820]   Mac laptop and then he converts it to windows which just
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.660]   throws me
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:12.020]   Yeah, it's good hardware, but uh, I don't know if I'd want to run windows on it
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:15.700]   I wouldn't either but the point the point is that if you're a developer or something like that
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:19.060]   And you want to or a web developer for example and you want to see how it looks on windows
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.940]   You can just flip over to windows check it out go back
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:28.020]   It's it's uh, it's the point is that if you're if it's your main machine and you're a professional
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:32.820]   And especially if somebody else is paying for it. You definitely want the Cadillac you know what i'm saying
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:36.980]   you you want to max out on memory and and and and uh
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:40.020]   And storage because within the next couple of years
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:44.020]   There's going to be a lot of stuff you can do with it even if you can't necessarily do a lot with it now
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:48.100]   So Stacy or you converted to the religion you're ready to go out and get a pixel
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.740]   Um, no, I just
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.940]   I am I am wishing that
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:57.140]   Like I want to edit your story because I think
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:59.940]   Take a few minutes go for it
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:01.380]   I'm like
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:06.980]   You underplayed this so you focus too much on uh, the chrome book extensions when it's really about
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:11.140]   The future of the internet and that's just an example of where you could go with this
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:14.180]   Yeah, because I think you're right with the where it could go
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:18.420]   I do think extensions are really pretty complicated for most people. They're basically
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:23.540]   A harder version of apps in a lot of ways people haven't learned to trust them the same way. So
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:29.940]   I'm trying to change that. I think I really think extensions are one of the most underappreciated things out there
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:34.100]   I agree with you. It's so fantastic. I want you to make a list somewhere. Okay. I will
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:38.980]   Publish it somewhere and just say yeah, you gotta do your list like yeah, yeah seriously just send it
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:44.660]   I mean should you want it kevin has about chrome books dot com so you could even send it there or you have your own site?
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:48.740]   Uh, you got me
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:56.100]   I have to say the pixel book is light. It's thin. It's actually a beautiful design. It feels good in the hand
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:27:01.140]   It's it's a really nice product. It's a lovely. Yeah, lovely machine. Yeah
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:05.300]   Scan it. Oh, here's the other problem. Mike. Here's oh, no, I have to yeah
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:11.540]   I would kill kill kill kill kill to be able to run Skype on it for this show. Yeah
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:16.820]   Well, that's not my back here. I have to borrow a Mac in in the office. I have to take
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:25.380]   My android tablet runs Skype well because it's native and I can use that and I've fooled Leo and Carson a few times you run up the tab
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:30.900]   But actually I try to run it for my pixel book for my pixel
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:36.740]   It's just we need to find a pixel book analog for Skype. We could use that. Wait. What about the microsoft server?
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:40.500]   Let's go for Skype because didn't that just I don't want to carry another machine
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.700]   I'll have that next week my machine if we could talk about it
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:50.020]   But but I I think Mike's right that windows is probably over is a little too bloated
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:53.540]   It's designed for business applications. It's not the right answer. I
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:59.860]   What I think we need is a Skype analog that's a Chromebook extension. I don't know if that's hangouts. I don't think it is
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:03.700]   Hangouts Google duo duo doesn't even run on the pixel book
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:07.860]   Isn't that odd for android doesn't run so it's one of those google things that doesn't run
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:11.060]   This is the drawback on this is you're a little bit dependent on google
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:18.980]   Yeah, I am anyway, so right. Yeah, I live love you to google. Yeah, it's fine. Follow the light
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:26.900]   Come use your pixel come on your grand day was a great success. Okay, even though amazon went down during prime today
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.900]   I know they had so many dogs
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.700]   Did you what about the dogs?
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:36.340]   When you get a failure they show this is one of the amazon dogs and there's a cockadoo
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:39.220]   There's a lot of them or whatever and yeah, there's a lot of them
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:45.060]   I didn't know that before I kind of like stacey avoided prime day. We feel like it's amateur hour
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:51.140]   Yeah, but uh there were some really good deals. They sold a hundred million products in 30 hours
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.980]   Sumerism is still alive. That's crazy still alive
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:29:01.060]   It also made jeff bezos briefly the richest man ever to live in the world
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:03.380]   uh
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:10.180]   One and a half billion to two billion dollars in revenue estimates gross merchandise value top three and a half billion
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:14.980]   This is according to rbc capital markets analyst mike. I'm sorry mark mahaney
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:20.020]   Company did not provide sales figures. It's a pretty good deals including a
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:23.060]   $750 for the base model pixel book. Yep
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:30.820]   Uh, but the number one device sold as we would expect was the amazon fire tv stick people love the fire tv stick
[01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:34.020]   Also because it's fascinating me tv
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:41.460]   Sorry go ahead. What fascinated me about this was how it brought up other retailers competitive retailer
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.100]   Jeff that's just amazing. They made a new holiday. They made christmas in july
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:49.540]   Well as I as I as I pointed out in a blog post yesterday, I think
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:57.620]   If you have a chrome extension every day is prime day. There's a there's an extension called camel camel camel. You've heard about this camel camel camel
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:30:01.380]   Yeah, I love it. There's a there's several others that will basically you when you're on amazon
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:06.580]   Well with the extension you just click a button when you're on amazon and says well here's where you should buy it go buy it over there
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:10.260]   It's like half price and so I gotta start using all this stuff. Yeah
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:16.340]   Prime day boosted other this is what jeff was talking about other large retailers sales by 54
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:24.340]   So what happened you know and I think this is this is probably you can thank the wire cutter and thrifter and other sites
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:29.380]   That when amazon prime had a deal would say oh, but there's a better deal of walmart
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:35.060]   And I bet you that's where some of that traffic came from is people just saying all right. I want to buy it
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:40.820]   Let's see where else I can get it. Maybe they use camel camel camel. Yeah, it gave people an excuse to shop and what happens is you're like
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:44.420]   Oh, this is a smoking hot deal and then you're like is it and then you're like, oh no
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:51.300]   Walmart slash prices. Also it also motivated the other retailers to put on great deals. Yes
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.700]   The consumer went all around now watch
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:56.500]   They're gonna go after amazon next in europe. I predict
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:31:02.340]   Next american company huge american company richest man in the world. They're gonna say amazon's evil amazon and and
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:07.620]   But will they is amazon is dominant amazon's really a you're not yet, but they're gonna go watch
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:14.100]   You just watch and reagan's you just watch and and uh, but this is just you where but okay
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.500]   It's it's helping um
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.820]   Yeah, it's helping
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:23.780]   consumers one time we landed in venus and we started driving north and
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:27.860]   Along the side of the highway you see this building start and you're driving and you're like well
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:33.860]   They're still built building is continuing and keep driving built like that's like an amazon building got to the other end amazon
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:41.380]   Massive actually amazon workers struck in europe during friday. So this is the problem
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:46.980]   Is european workers they just europe this is europe
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:51.300]   Because of course conditions in amazon warehouses are not ideal
[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:52.980]   Yeah
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:59.540]   And they decided to take the advantage of the big day to uh to have a two day strike on the screws. Yep
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:04.260]   Um, I don't know how that affected prime day
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:12.660]   Well, it can't be worse than amazon's site going down which apparently was fine. So now so are i in again and again and again
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:15.060]   maybe this is pure alix jones, but
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:20.820]   Do you think it's interesting that during the biggest day amazon hasn't more ban within anybody?
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:26.740]   There's no reason amazon couldn't anticipate any handle all the traffic they got that their sites
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:29.620]   Went down. I'm I gotta say
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:35.860]   If you're gonna hit america, you hit it where it counts. You're not gonna take your shirt off or you allix
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:47.780]   Uh, do you not think that this could be we had heard last week that there was a lot of chatter about the russians
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:50.500]   attacking the united states
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:57.220]   Of course the president said so what's the harm? I mean I get that people could not shop for their stuff in amazon is sad
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:01.780]   But that's not it's probing. Here's what they did in ukraine
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:07.220]   They took the power grid down for a few hours. What's the harm? It's a probe
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:11.940]   Uh, what you know, that's actually harmful. Yeah, it is harmful, but I mean honestly
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:18.500]   It's not as harmful as it could be what you want to do if you're if you're weaponizing hacking tools is test them
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.180]   Figure out what capable is you have that isn't the final result
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:27.140]   Absolutely, but if you could take amazon down if you could take not just amazon
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:30.820]   But all e-commerce down if you could take the internet down if you could take the grid down
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:33.460]   Uh, you could do some serious harm on the other hand
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:40.420]   I mean it basically teaches your foes to figure out how to protect themselves against those kinds of things
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:41.300]   That's true too
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:44.020]   And so you know, this is this is why I think that the
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:48.980]   Russian hacking is often ill advised because they're essentially training you
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:53.620]   They're training everybody how to protect themselves against you know, because when they really want to bring everything down
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:34:00.420]   Everything will be patched fixed etc. So I'm not sure the worst deal on prime day according to cnet
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:04.900]   $2,630 $52 for a used paperback
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:09.940]   Apparently some amazon sellers took advantage of prime day to hike the prices
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:14.100]   Oh, yeah, because if something ran out you might automatically grab it you might not pay attention
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:15.780]   Anyone buy it
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:23.620]   Deborah mcgillivray author of romance novels you may recognize these titles such as one snowy kni
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:25.220]   Oh, yeah
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:30.500]   Notice her book was being listed as high as two thousand six hundred thirty two dollars with free shipping
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:36.900]   Shipping was free. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, while other copies are selling for $99. She tweeted that out scott lady writer
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:42.900]   There's nothing illegal about someone listed in an item for sale actually. I have a friend who sells uh air
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.900]   purifiers on amazon not molecules somebody else and uh
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:54.180]   He makes them he has his name imprinted on he has a maid in china sells them using amazon marketplace
[01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:57.140]   But he noticed amazon undercutting him
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:05.220]   Selling the same thing selling his with his name on him undercutting him and then jacking the price way up
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:10.580]   amazon's automatic pricing routines are very aggressive. Yeah
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:16.420]   Yeah, andrew actually has done a lot of research into this because he's been looking at doing that sort of business model
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:19.220]   So if you ever want to know more about this
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:25.940]   Ooh, we only have long do you want me to have hook him up with my friend because he has a lot of anecdotal stories
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:36.100]   About about ways amazon helps and hinders. I think it's like raw capitalism. Yeah. Yeah, it is unfettered
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:40.180]   So I got uh, michiko kakatani's new book
[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:46.100]   Uh the death of truth. Yeah last night and then today I got an email from amazon saying I just received a three dollar
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:48.420]   20 cent refund on it. What?
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:52.580]   Oh, did you pre-order it? I pre-ordered it. Yeah. Yeah, that happens to me a lot
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:59.780]   I'm a big fan of the pre-ordering. We have a couple of really good internet history

[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.500]   That's fascinating general magic as you know mike
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:20.740]   You were probably covering silicon valley at that time
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:26.820]   Was a bunch of people who had worked on the mackintosh who were desperately trying to find something as earth shattering

[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:44.420]   And before me they had on a company that uh, oh god i wish i have the name of it because it was really cool
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.820]   uh, that's going to do um
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:53.140]   Live meditation in groups of similar people. Oh
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:57.060]   I gotta find this was really interesting. So they had the guy come on and of course he did
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.620]   He didn't just feel about the company, but then he
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:04.500]   Had the whole room including you know venture capitalists except one who wouldn't stop typing on his laptop
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.620]   um
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.580]   Meditate so that came on right before me
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:17.380]   So it was all everybody was calm and mellow and full of joy and all that then I had to follow talking about fake news
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:22.340]   So I got up and I said i'm so glad we're all so calm and mellow
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:24.740]   Joint this right now
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:27.700]   The world was falling apart you have
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:35.540]   It was it was great. It was just great. It was the whole room. What was the name of the company? It was journey journey meditation.com
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:38.820]   So they do meditate
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.140]   Um
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:48.340]   EY journey as an a taking a journey and so they're gonna do so so so they're arguing that all the all the things that exist now on meditation
[01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:51.780]   Are sorry didn't go off on this but it was kind of fun. Um
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:53.460]   uh
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:59.780]   Are recorded things this would be live and and and so you but you'd be in a meditation session with a with a guy
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:02.500]   You know a guide with other people at the same time
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:05.620]   Hmm that sounds or done
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:13.700]   I do productive for me. I do believe that meditation in a group with people is more effective than being alone
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:17.780]   You are the people but i'm not sure that transmits over the internet via
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:22.580]   IP does it uh, it's not really a group is it now? I don't think I
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:28.740]   Sounds cool though. We live just up the coast from the best meditation retreat. I just love it
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:33.380]   Which one uh down in a casio the uh, I can't remember the name of it now
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:35.940]   but um jack jack corne
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:41.780]   Corn blouse corn corn blooses arrested arrested development, isn't it?
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:47.060]   Cornfield maybe um I had a little too much wine. I think
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:49.460]   uh
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:56.020]   Needs meditation it is it is a jack cornfield. It is uh, what is the name of it? It's um, there it is
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:58.580]   Sir rock. Thank you karston knew what I was talking about
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.740]   Thank you karston
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:05.140]   It's really a great place if you ever want to go and it's group meditation and jack
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:11.780]   Others lead it and it's a it's a guided for the most part and it's really why is it better to work at a group than a
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:14.340]   On your own the vibe man
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:21.540]   He's coast doesn't understand this the vibe. Yeah, oh we don't yeah. Oh did I mention we're all naked
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:26.660]   No, you did not. No, no, no, don't you know what don't mention that. We're not
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:32.740]   We're not but jack is like a son of a jack is an amazing guy, but anyway
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:36.020]   I don't know why I decided to do that plug, but there he there he have it
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:37.700]   Um
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:43.940]   I have no idea how I took myself to meditation. I don't here's one that'll just piss Stacy off the case against teaching kids to be polite
[01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:49.540]   To echo she's gonna. Here's another uh column. She's gonna want to edit of mine
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:56.100]   Now you didn't you didn't make me mad. I just was like I feel like you're saying something, but I wasn't sure mike
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:02.020]   Oh, man. You really have the editors hat on get this woman a blue pencil. I'm sorry mike
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:05.300]   You're talking about this one or the other one. No the other one
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.060]   This one. Okay. I'll talk about this one the case of a against teaching kids to be polite to Alexa
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:12.740]   I'm sorry echo when parents tell kids to respect ais a assistance
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:18.260]   What kind of future are we preparing before I happen to have been saying this all along really? Yes
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:20.580]   I think you both are silly
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:27.860]   I think it's important because we're already anthropomorphizing these guys, right? Yes
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:35.300]   Assistance, I think it's very important because kids can't distinguish between them to have them learn how to be polite to them
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:40.500]   I think it's very important to teach the kids to distinguish between yes
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:44.820]   Yes, I'm not arguing. I don't think it's a false argument to say that those are
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:49.060]   Opposite sides of the thing opposite sides of the fence or argument
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:54.740]   It's but especially when they're young. I do think it's important for them to have empathy for things
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:58.580]   Everything even dogs cats, you know, how about the toaster?
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:01.540]   Even the toaster. I mean like they should not
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:06.420]   How often his a child a toddler gotten mad at something and slapped it and you're like no
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:12.420]   The reason but the reason for that is that it's property that belongs to an actual person
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:16.180]   It's not because there's anything about the toaster. This can be offended
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.180]   Don't understand
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:21.860]   Yeah
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:24.180]   Okay, you got a point Stacey. I kind of agree with you
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:25.220]   Okay, and at the same time though
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:30.820]   We really do one of the things kids need to be taught because they're gonna enter a world where this is going to be an issue
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:33.060]   Is the distinction between humans and machines?
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:42.020]   Yeah, exactly. It's been well understood up until now and also when when if your daughter is typing in google assistant for example and just says
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:44.500]   What's the weather?
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:53.620]   You're un you're unlikely to say say please you know, you know, you know, this but if she says the exact same thing to a google home device
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:57.780]   You might say oh, you should you should say please thank you all that stuff because it has a human voice
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:02.180]   Exactly. So we're already being tricked. We're already waving the white flag basically
[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:06.500]   um by teaching our kids to to number one treat
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:10.180]   uh, uh virtual assistants with respect
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:18.180]   Possibly deference and even to a certain extent obedience for example metell was working on this project that was canceled because it was so offensive
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:21.940]   Where it wouldn't it was like a virtual assistant. It was like an amazon
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:28.580]   Echo for children, but it wouldn't do what the child asked unless the child said please in other words
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.780]   We're teaching we they were they would teach kids
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:37.380]   That it's appropriate for machines to to judge and scrutinize human behavior
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:44.340]   And to decide whether the human behavior was acceptable before it would do that's what we were teaching kids with the metell thing
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:46.740]   And I think I canceled that and that wasn't yes
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:54.340]   The goal was to teach kids to not be little jerks. It was the same reason you have toys for children that say, you know
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:45:00.900]   That reward not whacking like the turtle toy that you know, if you beat up the turtle toy, it stops for a while
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:03.460]   so I would argue that
[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:07.620]   Forcing a child to say please in order to make something happen
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:10.740]   For a mechanical object is not great
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:17.300]   But teaching kids not to be jerks to things that we're already anthropomorphizing is probably an okay thing to okay
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.860]   So the future of these devices have cameras
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:23.060]   So will will we insist that the kids?
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:24.500]   um
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:30.660]   Say hello when they walk into the room. What do we want these devices to tell the kids to take their elbows off the table
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:37.300]   Where does it end? I say depends on what you want them to be taught like if I want my child not to put their elbows on the table
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:40.820]   And enforcing that through a camera enabled device
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:46.660]   Maybe and maybe it would be like oh your mom says not to put your elbows on the table. Oh no. Yeah, no see
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:51.940]   I
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:57.220]   You know what it's also like the escalator telling you how to go around the escalator. I'm sick
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:01.060]   Here's what Mike points out in this article and I think it's really a good thing
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:04.340]   Why do we have manners? Yeah?
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:08.020]   Tell us Mike. Why do we have manners?
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:12.100]   Because people because we're we're guarding the feelings of people and we're showing
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:16.340]   Other people for other people and I think that it's very important that we should
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:17.460]   um
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:22.420]   Tell kids that it's okay to talk to Alexa in the same way that they talk to a jar of peanut butter
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:24.740]   In the same way that they talk to the refrigerator
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:30.980]   Throw it across the room exactly just because it's simulating so here's the here's the biggest point that I think I think I may get you on this
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:32.580]   one stacy
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:36.980]   We have to prepare kids for a future that includes being polite to other people
[01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:44.580]   But we also have to prepare them for a future where everything is fake. They're going to have virtual reality. They're going to have uh real fake videos
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:48.100]   They're going to have uh fake Instagram celebrities. They already do actually
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:53.700]   And and so the kids have to be prepared to understand the difference between the things that simulate humanity
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:58.500]   And the things that are humans that's gonna be harder and harder and so this is a teachable moment that
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:02.820]   Amazon Alexa is basically identical to a toaster. It's a thing
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:08.660]   It's a property. It's not a person. It doesn't have feelings. You can't hurt its feelings. If you want to be polite
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:12.820]   That's fine. If you want to be rude, that's fine. It doesn't matter. It's an appliance
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:18.740]   That's the lesson teaching kids. Okay. What this conversation in the story though is missing is the
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:24.260]   A perspective from someone who's aware of developmental stages and kids at a certain age
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:29.060]   Kids cannot tell the difference between fantasy and real life up until about the age of five
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:32.980]   So trying to teach them that lesson before then is useless
[01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:38.100]   So making your kid or asking your kid to treat, you know your robot
[01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:42.900]   Civilian not wack it like a kid is supposed to do or a kid does is fine
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:46.020]   As they get older
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:52.500]   Having that in play I think having those discussions in distinctions between real life and other things
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:56.740]   I think is important. I think you're right. I think before five you're teaching them a habit
[01:47:56.740 --> 01:48:03.300]   After five you're just teaching understanding. I agree. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, that was a very succinct way of putting it
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.540]   I think that's so yes. It just depends on your kid
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:11.540]   And how old they are yeah, and where they are in the piage stages of of comprehension
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:12.900]   I think that's reasonable
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.940]   Teaching them the habit of saying please and thank you before five
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:20.100]   It's just a habit whether they say it to mr. Moon or they say it to you. It's just a habit
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:22.100]   This is one of those rare things that
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:24.900]   There seems to be a sort of universal
[01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:30.180]   Belief that kid should be polite to virtual assistants other than leo
[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:33.620]   Pretty much everyone was saying that yeah, you should be polite
[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:38.020]   No, and i'm just trying to say wait a minute wait a minute. What are we what else are we teaching?
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:41.380]   That's it this came about because some people saw that they're kids
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:44.900]   It's like the two they're two and three-year-olds were like, oh, Lexa, get me this
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:49.780]   Yeah, and they were like, I don't want to train it then they started treating their mom and dad like that
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:53.780]   That's not it. Well, but then you made it this given the distinction the other thing is
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:57.540]   Maybe children need somebody that they can bully
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:01.220]   Maybe that's just something they know
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:04.180]   That's a dark side of you
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:10.420]   Kids do have they have I mean like i'm sure we all had imaginary friends and some of us have imaginary I had to do yeah
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:15.220]   I had twins one was the good twin and one was the bad twin and it was Cindy and dindy
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:20.420]   And I can't remember who was which but like one I was free to treat like a total non-human
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:23.060]   I think she ended her life being pushed out of an airplane
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:28.020]   And the other was like you're good friendly so you need that right you needed you needed
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:30.420]   I had cakey and del arena
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:32.500]   and
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:37.380]   And cakey I don't remember which was evil or not because I was too little but yeah, I think you need that there's a
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:40.900]   Dark and light side right and you need somebody that you can
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:46.820]   Express your anger to safely now. That's google everybody just yells at google. Yeah, we just yell at google
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:50.180]   God, I love you guys. You know you really I
[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:54.180]   I think it's great to have you on the show today
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:59.860]   Was it illegal once upon a time to drink while on the air in radio? Yeah, it's probably still okay. Yeah
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:04.340]   Well, you're not supposed to operate a transist
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:06.980]   Submitter while under the influence
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:10.180]   That's what radio was operating
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:14.980]   It really was you had to get a license to if you wanted to be on the radio when I started
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:18.700]   Yeah, you had to get a license to operate a transist gonna start licensing
[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:22.260]   That was the job radio telephonic license third class
[01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:28.180]   Yeah, Howard Stern talks about that he he went the whole way got the license and all that you had learned Moore's code all the stupidity
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:29.380]   and our
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:31.140]   engineers code
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:33.140]   in the studio have
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:41.460]   There this is just to know we're illegal. Wow. This is john's federal communications commission radio telephone third class operator permit
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:44.660]   His restricted radio telecenum operating radios
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:46.580]   Huh?
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:48.900]   With a broadcast endorsement very important. Wow
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:52.100]   I don't have mine. I wish I had mine still
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:56.580]   This is expired in 1982 john
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:51:01.140]   Say little apps we are not in compliance
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:07.380]   No, really was you were you wait. Oh, here we go. Here's there's more. There's more. Oh, wait, man
[01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:08.820]   I have my
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:11.540]   And also framed I might point out this is my
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:16.740]   United States america federal communications commission amateur radio license. So I am
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:20.740]   I am legal to operate this microfib not professionally
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:25.220]   No, only amateur and only amateur ways. I have a california driver's license to
[01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:29.620]   Help I think it's hysterical. We have these framed john, but it's
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:31.940]   I
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:37.860]   No, it's got in the eighties. I remember taking a train in new york city and you had to take a big test
[01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:42.740]   It was a big deal. No idea. Anyway, you guys speak you to the fcc
[01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:49.700]   Just for a little thing real quick is agit pi seeing the light. I mean he's he's got doubts about the Sinclair Tribune purchase
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:52.260]   He explained to him that
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:55.540]   He was he was just writing writing a dead horse. No, he was
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:59.380]   I don't really be eating the dead horse eating the dead horse. He was he was
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:04.340]   He was sodomizing the dead horse. Whatever it was. He shouldn't have done it
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:10.180]   Uh, the horse was not happy the horse was unhappy and the rest of us were just appalled
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:14.740]   So really he's saying that i'm I think that that's blip service
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:16.340]   We should well
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:22.100]   Some were saying it could put the it could put the deal up entirely. That's what amazed me because why does all this Sinclair?
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:24.580]   Which is a big local television
[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:29.460]   Holding group is also famous for requiring its anchors
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:32.100]   to spout
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:35.700]   Trump propaganda and all sorts of things. Uh, they're trying to buy
[01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:41.140]   What is it the Tribune papers? What are they trying to buy? No, no, they're trying to be tv stations. Okay
[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:43.860]   and uh
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:45.860]   And they've adjusted their bid
[01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:49.620]   So one of those would be the giant ktla in los angeles
[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:53.860]   Uh, it's a 3.9 billion dollar deal
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:53:00.580]   And wenzd uh wenzd today. Sinclair said they planned to back off part of its proposal
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:03.460]   Um
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:10.020]   To satisfy rules that forbid a single company to own airwaves on such a dominant scale a good law. I think a good rule
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:11.220]   Yeah, I think so too
[01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:16.420]   Sinclair previously proposed selling off 23 of its tv stations after the deal was completed
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:24.260]   But several of those stations would still effectively fall within its operational control on monday. Ijet pys said he had serious concerns with those
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:26.660]   Devastatures on wednesday
[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:30.820]   The company said well, okay. We'll sell two of the stations one in dallas one in houston
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:35.140]   Through an independent trust not enough not enough
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:41.620]   Yeah, you really don't want a concentration of especially local media power in one or two hands
[01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:45.060]   That's just I we saw it happen in radio and it just killed radio. So
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:52.500]   I thought video killed the radio star. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry podcasts killed the video star
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:54.820]   Um
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:54:00.020]   Venmo I like this story because I've been I've been complaining about this for years when you set up Venmo
[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:03.300]   all of your transactions are public and
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:12.180]   This is obvious, but a beryllin based researcher analyzed more that there are 200 million public Venmo transactions from 2017 one year
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:13.860]   and
[01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:17.300]   Up, you know with the api you could see the names of every user
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.700]   You could see everything they spent their money on
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:23.780]   She said they you were she was able to learn an alarming amount about them now
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:26.820]   The key is that Venmo is public unless you set it private
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:30.900]   So the reason I bring this up is just to remind everybody if you're using Venmo
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:35.380]   Just there's a setting you have to go in and do it. I don't know why it's public by default
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:37.860]   It's kind of really you don't know why
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:40.500]   Why what is your benefit? What is paypal get it as that?
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:45.380]   More information. I mean well, they get the information probably the original anyway
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:49.860]   Why are they publishing it? Maybe they say look at all the people doing fun things with Venmo
[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:55.700]   They can use that data. They probably can sell that data if you haven't made public they can do it anyway though
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:55:01.940]   Don't they well? I don't know. I mean if you opt a lot of them say if you opt in we can do the following with your data
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:06.420]   Yeah, but when you open Venmo the very first thing you get to is a twitter like public feed
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:10.180]   Of all the things people have spent doing on you know
[01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:13.860]   Yeah, it's it's that gamification angle and I would say
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:16.420]   Remember when Fitbit there was a while
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:23.060]   Probably a couple years back maybe in 2013 when everyone freaked out because their Fitbit trackers could tell when they were having sex
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:28.500]   Right, right. So this is what I want to know is why eric paid Daniel for lip service
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:31.700]   and
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:34.500]   That's all I'm just saying, you know a lot of people use emojis now
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:38.420]   Keanna played Tammy for Ken's accident charge
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.500]   apparently
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:43.540]   Jesus was at the club with Chris and
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:46.340]   This has helped pave the bottle service
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:48.180]   Uh
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:54.820]   Weston paid Elizabeth. I'm on that sugar daddy type stuff. He says a lot of people. There's a whole there was there are
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:58.580]   Fun
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:56:04.660]   Transactions people tag these it is fun to read it is fun to read I like reading it
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:08.260]   But maybe you want to consider the sugar daddy stuff should be private
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:10.660]   Some stuff should be right
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:14.740]   It's not really what they're buying it for they're just I mean some people
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:18.820]   Yeah, you're right. They play with it. No, I did that I do that too. I make up stuff
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:22.340]   Right because it wasn't there a while back. There was like the story about people's
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:26.740]   Venmo accounts getting shut off because they would be like this is for the anthrax and
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:34.100]   Responsible for tracking terrorism and banking transactions kept shutting them down
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:40.340]   So according to quartz hackers account for 90 of log-in attempts at online retailers
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:46.500]   I don't need to say more. That's it. That's the story. Yeah
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:50.020]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:52.020]   A percentage of successful log-ins
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:54.340]   giving um
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:59.620]   Like stupid one-off stores like macy's my like when they're like, oh make an account for it
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:04.260]   That's I'm like, oh man, you know, you're just gonna lose this. Couldn't you go through someone I trust like amazon
[01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:07.860]   I'm just gonna mention we we talked to them about doing advertising
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:09.380]   They say that we don't have enough money to do it
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:12.340]   But I'm gonna mention it because I love it anyway privacy.com
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:16.340]   Let's you create uh credit cards for any purpose
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:21.140]   One-time use or only merchant specific use you can set a limit per charge
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:25.220]   Uh, I I wish they would buy ads, but they say we don't have the money
[01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:27.620]   So I'm just gonna give them a free plug because I don't wait. Let me understand
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:29.380]   So it's literally a credit card
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:30.660]   Uh, it's a debit card
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:35.380]   So here's the thing that people might worry about it ties it to your bank account or to your debit card
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:39.300]   So it takes the money right right out of your checking but you're not you're not
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:44.340]   Changing your credit rating by having more credit. No, it's not a credit card once you open a credit card
[01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:47.060]   You're supposed to never close it. No, it's not a credit card
[01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:51.380]   And uh, it's a it's effectively like you're creating debit cards
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:55.940]   You can make up a fake name and fake address so it's it's private
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:58:00.660]   Um, and you can buy a facebook political ads you could do. Yeah, that's a good point
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:04.820]   Privacy, I guess knows where you where you who you are, but uh, anyway
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:09.620]   I use this all the time because for that reason I don't want to you know, I want to be more private
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.580]   On these on these sites. Um,
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:14.420]   Do capital one have something like that?
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:15.460]   Yeah, capital one is that's part of that's
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:18.260]   You know, yeah, they were also they bought an ad. Yeah, we were down there
[01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:21.620]   Uh, do a panel for them itself by a capital one does that as well
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:27.780]   So I do that if you can because those those uh, one-time use cards really protect you in a variety of ways
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:30.580]   And actually I've been using my apple watch all the time
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:34.740]   Same reason because the merchant doesn't get any private information about you
[01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:38.820]   I mean apple does, but I think they're a little more trusted. They know you're an apple watch user
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:43.140]   Right. So that's it. That's the information. I guess everything you need to know right there
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:48.580]   I think we should wrap this thing up. Do you want to mention the fact that netflix's
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:53.220]   Numbers were a little weak. I think this is not a big story. It's certainly not a big story at all
[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:57.700]   Yeah, I was at I was at this conference day and a competitor said oh, they ain't dying
[01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:00.100]   Yeah, uh, you know, they're still
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:04.900]   They only grow they only grew by several million. You know big deal exactly. It's still grew hugely
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:09.220]   And actually read Hastings said you know the problem is our our prediction algorithms are very good
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:11.780]   We don't we we project a certain growth
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:18.980]   But but we often don't deliver it's happened before and you know, that's more a problem with the projections and anything else
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:21.620]   uh netflix
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:28.260]   Shares fell 14 percent the stock markets jittery the company only added four and a half million international customers. Oh
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:35.140]   Only 1.2 million us customers. Oh, no, I'm sorry. All right. The estimate was 1.2 million. They only got
[01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:38.020]   670 000 customers in the us
[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:40.980]   So leo if you bought your ticket on uh basil's rocket
[01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:49.220]   200 000 dollars and you know, you know, you know, I think a better deal be by uh by uh some rides on the on the
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:51.620]   The bobbin comment. Yeah, that's only five grand, right?
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:57.780]   Still see what do you get this you and you in basil's rocket you get to float for a few seconds
[01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:01.780]   And you see the curvature of the earth is there a lower price for prime members
[02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:06.580]   Only if you take if you vomit the whole foods
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:11.780]   Yeah, right exactly. Oh, that's what they should do. That should be like, um
[02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:13.700]   You know
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:16.260]   For the first person who spends 10 million dollars on prime
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:19.460]   On the rocket ship exactly
[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:24.260]   Amazing promotion and here's a blast from the past that i'm old enough to remember insta paper
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:30.980]   Insta paper arco arment's company was sold to beta works in 2013
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:33.540]   Pinterest
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:38.660]   Owned it for a while and now they've had an agreement to transfer ownership of insta paper
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:42.740]   To a company owned and operated by the people have been working on it since it was sold
[02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:45.540]   the the the employees
[02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:51.300]   Insta but i understand it's like pocket and allowed you to save that articles. I used to I still use it
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:55.300]   I loved it. Yeah, but if you're in europe because of gdpr exactly
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:59.140]   They basically they had to pull it back and then and there's still they still haven't got a gdpr version
[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:03.860]   So is that what killed it as a as a good venture for bitterest? I don't know. I don't think so
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:07.540]   I mean I was in europe and it was really frustrating because I use it
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:11.540]   Just as a bodily function and it was so great to go to switzerland suddenly it worked again
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:14.100]   I'm like oh my god, this you know switzerland is not me
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:18.420]   I read on the blog post that it started working in germany
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:23.700]   So they may have figured out how to be gdpr compliant. I I switched to pocket many years ago
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:26.660]   Although it's funny. I logged in after reading this straight in my insta paper account
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:30.820]   The last thing I posted was five years ago. It's fun though to read you know
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:33.700]   One of the articles I have on here
[02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:39.860]   Is how a dave moron rejected a hundred million dollar buyout offer for path from google
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:44.180]   I think looking back you mind google plus story. Yeah, yeah
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:46.980]   What has twitter become
[02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:52.260]   This is this is six years ago on the oriley radar
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:56.340]   mike lu look at is said oh man twitter
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:02:00.180]   It's all over because they pulled back the ability for third party developers to write
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:06.580]   Yeah twitter apps it was it's fun to read the old stories bring back some of the memories
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:09.700]   I'll select the name of the new company instant paper ink
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:11.380]   Oh I get it
[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:11.860]   Oh
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:11.860]   Oh
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:12.420]   Oh
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:13.460]   Get it
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:14.260]   Get it
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:14.660]   Instance
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:15.220]   Oh
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:15.860]   Paper
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:16.820]   ink
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:20.980]   Here's an article from the New York Times how companies learn your secrets
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:23.780]   Oh
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:25.940]   Oh
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:27.700]   It's actually been updated interesting
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:33.140]   Anyway, uh, let's let's wrap things up with picks and tips and numbers
[02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:40.820]   Let me start with stacy higgin botham the host of stacy on iot the stacy podcast at stacy on iot.com
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:44.020]   With kevin tofo what do you got for stace?
[02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:49.060]   So in my never ending quest to connect everything via voice
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:57.460]   Specifically mattelmay i'm i'm showing you guys i do not have this yet because again i'm not in my home for the next your june would be jealous
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:03:01.780]   Well, this is a different function. This isn't actually for someone like me because I don't
[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:06.500]   I don't think i've made a microwave meal and like years, but
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:12.020]   This is a connected oven from ge with 3000 pre-programmed
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:18.740]   Meals so you scan your meal into the app and the oven knows exactly how to cook it and will do it
[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:21.060]   you can also tell it to
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:23.620]   a battle may turn on microwave
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:28.660]   Um, and what's significant here is well, there are two things one
[02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:33.460]   This would be great for a dorm room or something somebody so lazy. They can't read the instructions
[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:36.020]   make popcorn
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:37.700]   but two
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:39.460]   They have created a
[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:41.460]   native support for
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:47.300]   Basically this microwave, which is amazing. So you no longer had ge has a skill called janeva
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:51.860]   So you used to be able to you used to have to say mattem a asked janeva to turn on oven
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:54.260]   now you just say
[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.380]   mattem a
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:04:01.940]   Turn on microwave in this case. How do they do that without a skill? It's it's the same sort of it's it's basically like native support
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:09.540]   So you have to have amazon's cooperation to do it. Yeah, you work with amazon and you create the ontologies for like what the device
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:13.140]   It's a data schema for connected devices. So what what is this device?
[02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:17.220]   What can it? What are the basic functions that performs and you pre-program that and then
[02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:23.780]   Anybody building that type of device can use it so they don't have to approve it. I would guess right? Yes, amazon builds it with them
[02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:25.860]   I see and then that's cool. Yeah
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:28.260]   So thermostats locks lights
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:33.060]   That's one of the big negatives of echo skills is you have to say open task and then
[02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:37.860]   Do it and so remember how to remember yeah, and this is really cheap
[02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:44.020]   It's 140 bucks for this microwave. That's really cheap. I don't know. I mean I think microwaves are cheap
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:48.820]   It just great our guns, right? Yeah, I don't think they're expensive
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:53.220]   Well anymore. This has got everything smart sensor easy clean interior
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:05:01.620]   0.9 cubic feet 900 watts is kind of a mini dinky. Yeah, I say this is for like your bachelor or your
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:04.340]   college to make a cup of soup with it
[02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:09.860]   Leo and I are old enough to remember when people debated whether to get microwaves radar ranges. They called them
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:12.580]   Yeah
[02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:20.100]   Yeah, well, so freestyle has a new type of oven technology or now it's st micro. It's an rf based technology. They just put in a melee oven
[02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:22.980]   It's actually pretty sexy
[02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:24.420]   Oh
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:28.500]   Don't tempt me again. I gotta do it Stacy. You know that's hot
[02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:31.860]   Yes, yes, I just that's hot. Thank you, Mike
[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:36.100]   I can't believe I left that left that on the table Mike yelgin your pick of the week my friend
[02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:41.460]   Okay. Well remember back in the day when the internet was fun. Yes. Okay years ago
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:45.220]   The internet we thought it was gonna change the world for the good. We were wrong about that
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:47.300]   But okay, but but it was fun
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:53.300]   And so I have a newsletter called mics list and where I always have I seek out really fun websites
[02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:57.460]   I thought I'd share you're this the new stumble upon exactly I am

[02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:12.180]   So this is a game based on street view
[02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:18.260]   Google street view where it puts plonk you down in some place in the world and you guess where you have to figure out
[02:06:18.260 --> 02:06:24.420]   Using clues you walk around in the environment and try to figure out where you are. I'm thinking vermont
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:32.420]   Oh, where am I now probably? I'm in a desert road. Yeah, this is not can we can we walk to the other side of that sign?

[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:48.500]   All right. So we're in an english-speaking country. Yeah, that is not how the us does their signs. It's not
[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:51.300]   Let's see what this signs. Let's see what this sign says

[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:11.060]   And the sign says that is not a sign says railway crossing stop on red signal. I know you think that's not the us
[02:07:11.060 --> 02:07:13.620]   No, that looks like the us. I was gonna say there was a there was a
[02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:20.020]   An angular sign back there that was in a I think it was a yellow sign if it was a yellow sign then it gives you uh
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:29.140]   Huh the power poles look different too crossing. Okay, so english so okay. So that's a really it's a really fun. Let's walk into town

[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:46.340]   A google country energy. Uh-huh. Oh my god. You're too smart for this game really fun. Okay
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:48.340]   We had to work on this image. So
[02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:53.700]   No, apparently we jeff is you know, we should teach jeff how to treat images
[02:08:53.700 --> 02:09:01.300]   Um, okay couple more couple more fun sites that are really fun. Another one's called take me back to take me back dot two
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:08.420]   We had too much fun with this you put in a date or a year. Yeah. Yeah, and it it gives you all kinds of information about what was happening that day
[02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:11.220]   I don't know they use cookies. Is that okay? No, that is not okay
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:14.260]   Take me back to yeah
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:21.380]   So a date for me my my birthday my birth year. Okay. Can I go the day you can go to the day? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, fember
[02:09:21.380 --> 02:09:30.660]   How do you spell no? November 29 1956? Okay, so there's gonna be lots and lots of information. This is great for writers for example
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:32.660]   Um, it was thursday
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:38.340]   Sagittarius the president was Dwight de Dwight de Eisenhower famous people born on this day
[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:44.980]   Yvonne for varg and hinton battle they must have more famous people than that born on this day
[02:09:44.980 --> 02:09:51.300]   The seventh cavalry was the most viewed movie. So you get old newspapers the the front page of a newspaper
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:58.020]   This is really cool. It's hit songs that were you know hits at the time the what kinds of stuff I look like if you're a novelist
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:04.980]   Or you're a writer. This is a great way to to paint the picture about what was happening in the in the culture movies are crappy in
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:10.340]   Terrible terrible terrible. Yeah, that's why I'm so much fun looking through the old New York Times
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:15.860]   Yeah, this is really a great idea and then you could click here for a personalized message. You could send this to somebody
[02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:21.460]   So this is a this is a fun site just to mess around with one more site in the UK. It looks like it might be
[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:24.100]   a little biased toward the UK
[02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:31.060]   I don't know. Here's discover how the u.s. Looked. Oh look at that in 1956. This is how the u.s. Looked
[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:35.300]   Santa Claus was in Santa Monica, Florida welcomes you
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:38.660]   Uh, there we go. We have a picture
[02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:41.620]   racism racism
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:45.860]   Everything was very with Santa Claus in the beach and racism. That was it
[02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:48.580]   Uh, okay. It was a crazy time
[02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:52.820]   The third one is a is a site called starring the computer
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:56.660]   So, you know, we're having to you're watching you're watching a show and you see an actress or an actor and you're like
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:58.180]   What else were they in?
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:11:04.020]   Well, this is that yes with the computer so you see a computer and like what computer was that and it will talk about
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:09.380]   And it rates the movies and tv shows based on how accurately they portray the technology
[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:11.780]   Oh my god. This is the nerdiest thing ever
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:18.580]   Absolutely. Did you know that the one laptop per child appeared in the film savages? I did not know that I did not as well as an apple
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:20.260]   Unibody iMac
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:24.260]   And a panasonic tough book look look sleeping beauty. She's
[02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:30.420]   Some somebody needs a life somebody. No one bring this up at parties or casual conversation
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:34.500]   I think that's really important just to come with a caveat. I've already got kids. I don't care
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:39.220]   Oh, man. This is kind of fun. This reminds me of my favorite one of my favorite sub-read
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:42.820]   It's it's a Unix system. Oh where they show uh clips
[02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:48.660]   From the playback of various computer screens and movies and and they're so stupid. There's
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:53.460]   They're so bad and just fonts and yeah, it will spoil movies for you basically. Yeah
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:56.820]   Um, I was watching tv show the other night
[02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:01.220]   And I noticed the guy supposed to be on a webcam, but it says dot jpeg
[02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:03.620]   the name of the frame
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:09.380]   Okay, okay, okay. They're very nice. So where how do I subscribe to this fabulous newsletter?
[02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:15.380]   This is a really old school. It's just a website. Do you go like stuff? Yeah at elgin.com. Yeah
[02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:19.140]   So
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:23.620]   Elgin.com/micslist if you want to get the newsletter used to say that was a newsletter. It is no michael. Okay
[02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:31.380]   Elgin.com/micslist. Okay free newsletter weekly. It's a lot of fun. It's basically all the irresponsible stupid ridiculous
[02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:32.980]   uh
[02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:38.820]   Dangerous things and technology in other words. It'll give you hope exactly once again exactly mics list subscribe
[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:46.500]   The best tech newsletter ever published. Thank you michael ever. Do you have a number for us mr. J? I do indeed no
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:50.260]   I just lost it. So oh hell I lost it. There it is
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:53.620]   Um, so I actually even quin nelson
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:57.780]   Who makes videos about about technology online? I saw this come across
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:03.780]   Um, and it's it's one of those ridiculous surveys that some company just does but I couldn't resist
[02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:06.340]   So it was survey of 1500
[02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:07.780]   uh, signal people
[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:12.580]   60% 65 of iPhone users are inclined to consider a first date with an android user
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:18.100]   But only half of android users would say the same about an iPhone. Yeah, who are the snobs now
[02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:20.900]   It
[02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:25.620]   That's well and iPhone users are kind of obnoxious. Yeah, so I'm sorry. I gotta say it
[02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:29.300]   Uh, it was there was a couple years like three years ago
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:32.660]   There was a story about people who were on dates
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:37.940]   Or like tender dates when you were trying to text with people to see if you wanted to go out on a next date
[02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:44.580]   The people who had iPhones were judging all the android people because they're you know how your text bubbles are different colors if you're in one
[02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:45.860]   Right
[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:50.020]   So they wouldn't date the android users. So that that's actually counter to
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:57.140]   This I'm sure very legitimate so it comes from tender users site that sells your old tech called the clutter
[02:13:57.140 --> 02:14:00.500]   So maybe exactly so I'm going to do with a major caveat
[02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:06.180]   It's right more than a third of men feel a crack screen demonstrates a lack of personal care for actually ready
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:09.220]   I agree with that. I will not date somebody with a crack phone
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:11.140]   I just think you're a teenager if you have a tech
[02:14:11.140 --> 02:14:14.260]   I mean, I've never seen a teenager with the non-cracks. No, they're all cracks
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:18.100]   Some people like people with cracked phones. They want it somebody who's willing to make mistakes
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:22.660]   My daughter cracked her phone. She didn't want me to fix it because she said no, no, no
[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:24.660]   That's uh privilege privilege
[02:14:24.660 --> 02:14:28.260]   She says she wanted to show she was a person of the people. Oh my
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:32.100]   With her. I don't think the iPhone is the people's phone, but okay
[02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:35.060]   Actually, I don't know if it was an iPhone. It might have been oh, you know
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:38.340]   She basically she gets whatever I'm not using
[02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:42.900]   This is my pick of the week and it's kind of an oddball
[02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:46.260]   Pick this comes from a stanford research study
[02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:48.900]   it's called almond
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:54.820]   And you can download the app on android. You can run it out of the website
[02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:59.300]   It's a virtual assistant that knows odd things like get a cat gif
[02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:03.940]   It'll do that. There's actually a whole list of commands
[02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:09.700]   You could tweet the latest nasa astronomy of the day picture. You can auto reply to my emails
[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:14.340]   You can do some if this than that stuff like when a file changed on my dropbox
[02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:19.700]   Um email it to me or when I've used more space than dropbox. Let me know
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:21.460]   holidays
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:24.740]   I cal events they're trying to I think the stanford group
[02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:31.860]   Oh, by the way and one of the things I really liked it works with lg web o s tv's which includes my tv at home
[02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:36.820]   So I can use almond to turn the tv on to unmute it to unmute it
[02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:40.580]   Um, but what's interesting? This is an academic
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:45.780]   Project using thinga pedia. It's an open virtual
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:50.340]   assistant and crowd sourced because thingpedia is crowd sourced
[02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:52.900]   so
[02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:54.660]   for instance
[02:15:54.660 --> 02:16:00.580]   When the bitcoin price reaches $20,000 search for bitcoin picture and tweet it with the caption. I am rich
[02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:02.820]   Huh
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:04.900]   Now how much would you pay?
[02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:06.260]   Isn't that cool?

[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:52.180]   You're in favor of manipulation on social
[02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:57.220]   No, I just I someone someone was arguing that it wasn't a big deal really
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:17:00.820]   On one of our shows
[02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:06.100]   But it wasn't jeff. Okay, never mind. I don't know who would not sign his billiard god knows what I say, but
[02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:09.220]   Are you going on the show?
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:13.940]   Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, I think everybody has a pick everybody has said their say
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:18.980]   This was a really fun show not the least of which because we enjoy to find pino bottles

[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:04.900]   You can also and I I've been saying this a lot more lately because I think it's kind of cool
[02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:07.780]   All one of the things I love about these voice assistants
[02:18:07.780 --> 02:18:10.020]   Is it really has been good for podcast?
[02:18:10.020 --> 02:18:10.580]   Yeah
[02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:14.420]   Because you can ask for a podcast from almost any of the voice assistants and they'll play it
[02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:20.500]   So if you say listen to this week in google on your google home or your echo or your even your carman card and
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:26.100]   katana based device or your home pod it should play. Yeah most recent that sounds great
[02:18:26.100 --> 02:18:28.900]   It'll sound great and you know it's it
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:31.460]   I've always said if podcasts were as easy to listen to his radio
[02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:37.380]   We'd have a shot and I think they are now. So that's a big change. Don't forget stacey haganbotham's iot

[02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:53.380]   Yeah, that's the one little thing you have to know what but that's always the case the yeah
[02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:57.940]   You have to know what it's called echo play the internet of things podcast and that should be enough
[02:18:57.940 --> 02:19:02.100]   Sometimes you have to add on tune in. I don't know why on some of our shows. Yep
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:06.500]   Uh, there's an issue with some of our shows playing it in a group in an echo group
[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:10.340]   But we don't know we haven't been able to figure out what that's all about because other podcasts you can do it. I don't know
[02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:14.260]   Uh podcast actually now are easier than listening to the radio
[02:19:14.260 --> 02:19:18.100]   Why does radio exist? I know you have a show who needs radio
