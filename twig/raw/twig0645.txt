[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey as the week off.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.800]   Attorney Kathy Gellis joins us.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.200]   She's going to explain ancillary copyright.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.640]   It has something to do with Link Texas.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.800]   And Pruitt's also here, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.760]   We'll take a look at some of the announcements at CES.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.840]   And then the bitter Twitter battle
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.960]   between Dion Warwick and Oreo cookies.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.400]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.680]   I will retaliate at a later date.

[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560]   Show me cover the Google verse, the Facebook verse,
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.680]   the Twitter verse, the media verse.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.840]   @Amprewit is here from Hands On Photography.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840]   Hello, Rhett.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.800]   Good to have you back.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.920]   Hello, Mr. LaPorte.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.000]   Happy New Year to you.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.920]   Happy New Year to you.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.920]   Happy New Year to you.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.400]   Did you go anywhere for the holidays?
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.880]   No, sir.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.360]   I told you I was going to strategically find myself
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.120]   on the butt group of my couch.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.200]   And I did it successfully.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.680]   You did everything you hoped.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.160]   It lived up to your greatest dreams.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.440]   It was awesome.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.160]   I even caught up on that succession show.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.480]   Oh, well, we'll get it.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.960]   I didn't binge it like you all explained.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.560]   Oh, I'm eager to hear your reviews, sir.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.080]   This is such a good show.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.800]   Oh, good.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   Good.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.760]   Oh, it's so good.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.240]   And I love Roman and his smart out like kitty-eyed toys.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.760]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.160]   I'm glad we didn't lead you astray, Mr. Pruitt.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.840]   Oh, it's so good.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.800]   That, by the way, that baritone is the Leonard Taill Professor
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.640]   for journalistic innovation at the--
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.400]   [SINGING]
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.200]   --graduate school of journalism at the City University of New
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.320]   York, Lesmachines.com is his blog at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.960]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   Happy New Year to you, too.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.760]   Hello, boss.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.520]   Happy New Year.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.040]   Good to see you.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.280]   Did you do anything or did you just hunker down?
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.200]   Oh, no.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.000]   I just hunker down and worked.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.280]   Happy-- happy Omicron.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.960]   I tried not to work.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.040]   Tried really hard.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.600]   You know, I realized if I don't work,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.120]   if I don't do anything, I just sit on the couch.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.880]   I get really lazy, and then I'm too tired to work.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.360]   So I sat on the couch thinking about stuff
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.240]   that I could be doing.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.760]   It was a battle.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.000]   It's counterintuitive.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.760]   You actually get more time if you don't do anything than if you do something.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.280]   Oh, man.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.760]   I struggled with it.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.520]   I can say that there was one day, maybe two tops,
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.760]   that I felt like I was on vacation.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.560]   The rest of the time, my mind was just all over the place
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.640]   like, oh, I could be working on this, or I could be reading this.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   And that's a hazard.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.080]   Oh, that's not vacation.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.800]   A hazard of the productive people.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.520]   Hey, we want to welcome somebody brand new to our microphones.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.120]   Stacey here, Motham's taking the week off.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.440]   She'll be back next week.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.360]   Joining us now, US lawyer, specialist in international law,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.800]   civil liberties, and the convergence thereof and tech.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.920]   She's a contributor at Tech Dirt.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.560]   Kathy Gellis, welcome to this week's school.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.000]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.040]   So good to have you.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.520]   Hey.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.400]   C G council.com.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.000]   So you and I am known to applaud Kathy's tweets and pieces defending the First Amendment,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.360]   defending good sense.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.400]   And so I'm delighted you're here, Kathy.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   Oh, thank you.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Would you call yourself?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   I already get to you everywhere with me.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   A section 230 expert.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.560]   I would indeed call myself a section 230 expert.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.560]   Yes, she is.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   Oh, well, we'll try that.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.160]   I was doing it before it was cool.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   Okay.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   Yes.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   Okay.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160]   Well, it's great.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   There's her Twitter feed.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160]   Great to have you.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.720]   I will now follow you religiously, which means I'll be on my knees as I follow you.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720]   I should have that.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   She should have that.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.720]   Sitting is fine.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.520]   You can read the tweets while sitting.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   Okay, good.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   Thank you.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.520]   Thank you for that dispensation.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.000]   CES is going on.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.680]   It's so weird right now to be sitting here with CES going on in Vegas.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.120]   It officially began today.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.720]   Although, as always, the weekend brings those special mini conferences and stuff.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   There's a lot of stuff.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.840]   I don't know if there's a whole lot to say about CES.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.360]   You really wanted to go.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.000]   We said you may not.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.720]   You must stay home.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.880]   Are you watching the smart decision?
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.880]   It turns out.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.040]   I've been trying to watch from afar, but it's been really, really hard between weeding
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.520]   through emails from being on vacation and trying to just sort of pick through what is
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.120]   actually some good meat and good stories.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.960]   And virtually no one being there from the big tech companies.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   No one being there.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.920]   So it's been a little rough.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.640]   I've only seen one thing that had me curious and it came just before we came on air.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.600]   Oh, what was that?
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.720]   Well, Canon, they're still working on stuff in the VR world.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.960]   So they have their R5 mirrorless camera.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.840]   That's not their pro grade one, but it's one of their more expensive ones.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.840]   That's the one I got, Andrew.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.720]   They got him the R5, not the R6.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.720]   No, no.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   I got the R6.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   Oh, nice.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   Which one's the less expensive?
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   The R6 is less than the R6.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.720]   That's the one I got.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   And the 6 is still nice.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.800]   Yeah, you just need it for video for TikTok.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.360]   So I think it's good enough.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.920]   Yeah, it'll be perfect for that.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.960]   But they're doing this whole dual fisheye lens thing.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.800]   Yes, we saw that.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.680]   So the world of VR.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.040]   And if you have all that horsepower behind it and they shoot 8K on that camera, it could
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.800]   create some pretty interesting images and maybe something fairly immersive.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.920]   But I'm just curious about the implementation.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.800]   Where is this going to be used beyond the world of real estate sales?
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.480]   Alex Lindsey mentioned it when they first announced it on Macbreak Weekly because he's
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.840]   all into this VR 3D stuff.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:48.280]   A $2,000 lens that gives you a 180, I guess 180 degree field of view for your VR productions.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.400]   I am not a fan.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.920]   I'm trying so hard.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   It's cool.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.120]   I keep everybody's talking about augmenting reality is the next big thing.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.760]   I'm just trying so hard.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.040]   I think AR is the next thing over VR.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.400]   I'm still battling with VR.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.120]   I believe I mentioned on our end of the year show that I think AR is going to be pretty
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.080]   awesome if someone can just really set it up to where it's not a bunch of security problems
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.080]   and things like that.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.520]   Because if you want to walk down the street and say hello to the person coming, you know
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.640]   who they are because it has a nice little identifier.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.520]   But we don't want to know their credit score and things like that showing up above their
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   heads.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.920]   I think there's a cool spot for AR if we can just get it implemented with the right security
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   stuff.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:45.040]   This was announced at CESTCL with a Chinese television maker announced their second version
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.160]   of their wearable display glasses which looked kind of like Raybans.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.880]   But you wouldn't want to walk around because you're not seeing the world around you.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.280]   You're seeing two 1080p micro OLED screens.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.280]   It's not AR then.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.520]   No, it's VR.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   The lenses are OK.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.960]   That might make some sense.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.760]   But then again, if you're just watching screens here, why not watch screens?
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:16.920]   Well it's like 140 inch screen from 13 feet away.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.720]   Yeah I'm with you, Jeff.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   Why?
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720]   Why?
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.680]   That's the question.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.680]   Why?
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.360]   Because these companies are trying to make money on whatever the next thing is and nobody
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   knows.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.760]   So they're all just guessing they're throwing spaghetti.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:38.480]   I am going to stand by my contention that we already have the most amazing virtual experiences
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.640]   ever.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.440]   And it's motion pictures.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.080]   When you're in a movie theater, I thought you were going to say Zoom.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   Grand round.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.760]   No, think about this.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.160]   And it's 100 year old as Drew, I understand.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.000]   And they've perfected it so that when you're in a color, what else do they need?
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Listen to me.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   What?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   When you're in a theater.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.920]   It's true because you used to.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.240]   Go ahead, Kathy.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.920]   Yeah, no, let me tell you why you're right.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   Thank you.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.120]   It's true because like the distance between where we were before and then all of a sudden,
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.320]   voila, you've got movies and the distance between where we were when you've got movies
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.520]   to now.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.680]   Now is negligible.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.600]   But the real revolution was going from nothing to movies.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.920]   But I would submit it's still effective when you're sitting in a theater, it's darkened.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.360]   The screens in front of you, the sounds around you.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.840]   Movie makers have gotten very, very good at you feel like you're there.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   Am I not right?
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   Yes.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   Yes.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.960]   Sound design is so much bigger now in cinema.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.160]   It's part of the reason why I enjoy more movies now is just because of sound design.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.200]   Dialogue is another problem, but sound design just really locks me in.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.960]   And the choice of music to get your, I mean, what is VR about?
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.280]   It's about tricking your mind into thinking you're having a real experience.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.960]   And honestly, a good movie.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.720]   You don't think I'm sitting with a sticky floor on, you know, old beat up.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   What kind of theaters were those around me?
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.720]   Oh, man.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   He's like the one left in that.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.760]   No, you think you're, you know, you're, you're in Chinatown, Jake.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.240]   And, and it's, and it's so vivid that you feel like you had an experience.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.640]   I think we, we should not diminish that.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.560]   That is a very refined technology.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.160]   And the problem is you can't sell a $1,300 glasses.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.760]   And you, you know, I mean, you can't make money on the content, except for selling a
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   movie ticket.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.040]   I mean, you can obviously there's an industry all built around it.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.680]   But I just, I think the tech, this is a really good example of Silicon Valley.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680]   Doesn't want to stand still.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.680]   Right.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   Too hard.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680]   We can't stand still.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.560]   And Kathy's point two is really important to us is, if you look at that, that kind of leaps
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.120]   in creativity, pardon me, Gutenberg moment coming.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.120]   Oh, God.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120]   Oh, there it is.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   There it is.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.120]   First one.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.120]   Take your breaks, people.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.960]   Take your breaks from 14, from 1450 until 1800.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.120]   There was basically no advance in the technology.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.840]   Because what are you going to do?
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.560]   People did the perfect it.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.240]   They invented the novel, the modern novel and the essay and the, and the Mark of a printer
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.960]   plays and the newspaper.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.360]   So there's, there's more to be done visually with what we have.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.760]   I agree.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.320]   So yeah, I think VR is about as meaningless.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.480]   Watch out and hear as NFTs.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.800]   Oh, it's, it's not like, it's not the first time that it's been talking about.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   And now we've got VR.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.240]   They've been talking about VR before, before like in the 90s.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   90s.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.840]   It's like it's going to be the thing and it wasn't the thing.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.960]   I mean, it was interesting as, you know, had some interesting applications, whatever,
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.600]   but it mostly like it never answered the why.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.080]   And I think there, the technology is better, but I think we still haven't answered the
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   why.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.080]   And I think if you don't answer the why, nothing's going to happen with this trajectory either.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:12.880]   I remember going to SIGGRAPH in Los Angeles in 1992, wearing a big VR helmet attached to
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:19.960]   a big cable attached to a multi-million dollar computer and flying on a teradactyl.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.000]   And it was substantially the same, except for the heavy, that's set.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.680]   But it was substantially the same.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.240]   And it was, it was a gimmick.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.400]   It was cool, but it was a, I feel like it's still gimmick.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.040]   By the way, meta thinks maybe it's a gimmick.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:39.920]   They have fired 300 developers that were working on a custom VR, AR operating system,
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.920]   which is ironic.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.480]   They just renamed themselves meta.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.480]   They just renamed it.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.680]   According to the information, meta instructed employees to stop working on an operating
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.920]   system built for scratch from scratch for virtual reality headsets at the XROS project
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.800]   had been in development since 2017, 300 employees working on it.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.820]   Now I don't know if that's what Mark was demonstrating when he did that famous now
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:15.820]   infamous meta video, which is ironic because the virtual character looked more like a human
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.200]   being than Mark Zuckerberg did.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:26.160]   But maybe, maybe there was something wrong with, you know, the OS or it wasn't doing it.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.440]   But the company told some staff, according to the information, they'll continue to modify
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.180]   an open source version of Android to do this.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.680]   Whoa.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.620]   Who equals Android?
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:45.380]   Met his modified version of Android internally known as VROS, not XROS powers the current
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.380]   Oculus VR headsets.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.780]   Did they also realize that people were going to trust them with it?
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.220]   No.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.420]   Are you kidding me?
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:05.700]   Mark Zuckerberg has no introspective, no awareness, no insight into how people view Facebook,
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.700]   what do you think?
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.700]   No.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.700]   No.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:15.080]   I mean, he gets memos periodically, but I don't think that instinct is necessarily there.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.920]   He's classically tone deaf.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.080]   Do you see, have you seen Kathy?
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.000]   Have you seen the new Netflix movie, Don't Look Up?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Oh boy.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Oh boy.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Oh boy.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.240]   There is a character in it that's a tech, uh, Mark Zuckerberg is the third.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.120]   Well, he's, no, he's across the various ones, I think.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.520]   I think there's a little Steve Jobs in him.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   Mark Zuckerberg is there.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.520]   I think Elon Musk.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.620]   I think he, oh yeah, he's a mix of all of them.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.620]   Sure.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.380]   All of the spectrumed folks in the field.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.420]   I wish I could play a clip from this.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.780]   Because Mark, Mark, Mark, right.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.980]   I mean, you got a lawyer here right here who could defend you, Leo.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.980]   I am not your lawyer.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.980]   I am a lawyer.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.980]   I am not your lawyer.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.980]   Let's be clear.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.980]   Dad, gummy.
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.980]   She's good.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.980]   Yeah, she's good.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:04.420]   She's going to say, uh, fair use is a defense.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.920]   Not a, you're just going to be a lawyer.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.080]   I mean, I'm here more to mock stupid things about the law as opposed to a council, anybody
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.440]   on how to actually like navigate it.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.120]   I'd rather complain about, you know, this is a very dysfunctional conversation because
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.480]   we should be able to like enjoy the culture around us.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.200]   And it's not clear that we actually can.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.800]   And that's a bad thing that comes at a cost.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.860]   So the law I do is to inventory that, complain about that and to see if maybe we can make
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.020]   things better, but that's not a one on one represent people.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.920]   That's a try to fix it for everybody type.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.920]   Thank you.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.480]   Discussing it and that there's any question about whether we could actually like share
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.600]   an example of what it is we're talking about.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   Thank you.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   Maybe it would be fair use.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   But she's right.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   No, she's right.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.440]   But it's a, it's a bigger problem because maybe that would be fine.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.760]   Yeah, you could sort of make a fair use analysis, but you know, the expression is fair use
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.080]   is the right to hire a lawyer.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.000]   Like, just don't want to have the problem to deal with.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.720]   But the fact that we're chilled, we have now, you know, abruptly veered off our conversation
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.120]   because of the legal.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.120]   It's chills.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.400]   If this is the law, it has a cost.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.800]   And the irony is this law is supposed to stimulate creativity and expression.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.400]   And here it is suppressing it.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.680]   So I think we've got problems.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:30.400]   Here's the, here's the, I could show a picture, I think of Mark Rylance as Peter Isherwell
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:36.200]   the tech guru who says, wait a minute, don't save the earth.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.840]   Don't destroy that comment.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.000]   There's materials we could use.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.360]   That's it.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.200]   If you haven't seen it, it really is great.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.400]   And when you see it, just note that character because he is exactly how I think he's how
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.240]   the world started to think of Silicon Valley.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.960]   And I think that's actually a bit of a problem for Silicon Valley, frankly, the out of touch
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.000]   billionaire, you know.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.800]   I did not want to watch it because I saw that it was number one on Netflix and I have a
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.120]   history of catching things that are number one on Netflix and just hated them.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.760]   Wait, didn't you like that Tiger show?
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.800]   I mean, that would be no, sir.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.440]   It's horrible, but I went ahead and gave it a shot because we made you.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.720]   I think we made you do that, didn't we?
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.400]   We like had a group viewing on a.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:34.600]   I have to see this movie, but the idea that like, I think the point is trying to make
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.960]   that humanity can be kind of clueless about reacting to its actual problems.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.560]   Avenue Q did.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:46.120]   I think it's no, if not Avenue Q Avenue five, this namespace collision is not good, but
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.520]   Avenue five was a production which they made one season.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.400]   I don't know if they're making another one.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:57.440]   It starred Hugh Laurie and it was excellent and it basically predicted the pandemic behavior
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.760]   before the pandemic behavior was actually getting exhibited with.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.560]   Oh, I know that's the one where they're in the spaceship.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.000]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Right.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.360]   Yes, it was very, very funny and also horrible and awful and just an amazing encapsulation
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.840]   of boy, are we dumb as a species?
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.540]   It's a there is a there is now I think this is a genre starting with the
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:26.000]   theocracy wall e to a certain extent was that also with the people in the floating chairs
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.680]   and their big gulps Avenue five, which I like to have in you five.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.960]   There's something about it missed.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:38.600]   I don't know exactly what it was, but it and obviously HBO did not renew it.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.040]   And I think don't look up isn't perfect either, but it is a commentary and it follows in that
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.960]   exact vein of, you know, without spoilers, the scene in the airlock, which is kind of
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.040]   like two thirds through the series or whatever, just the scene in the airlock.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.960]   It isn't even funny because it's actually so real like you can turn that off and turn
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.560]   on the news and you've seen the exact same thing.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.480]   I stand corrected Avenue five was renewed.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.480]   So good.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.920]   I look forward to season two.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   That's good.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   All right.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.800]   So the credit of don't look up eyes.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.880]   They made me quite angry within the first 30 minutes to an hour of that movie and I guess
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.080]   they deserve some credit for that.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.480]   They made me a moat.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.960]   Angry because of the president and her lack of interest.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.160]   You just watch it and you're thinking, Oh man, this is a total reflection of the crap
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.160]   that I see right outside.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.920]   It was a little too close to home.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.080]   And you just, oh, it fired me up and I almost turned it off.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.880]   But I said, just, just continue to watch that.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.440]   I just read that that script was written before COVID, which is another thing that's
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.440]   kind of interesting.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.760]   Crazy, right?
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.080]   It was really, yeah.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.680]   Anyway, we don't have to go on and on.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.200]   I think Avenue five was as well, which was the other thing that was a little bit creepy.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.960]   My favorite part of Avenue Avenue five is when they lose.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.520]   They're in a giant spaceship.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   They're out in space.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.280]   It's a cruise though.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.440]   And they're all doing yoga and the ship tilt suddenly.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   They're like us.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.960]   To me, I just, I don't know.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.360]   I enjoyed that.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.480]   Let's talk again about a more new Kathy that we sometimes get off.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.480]   A little bit.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.320]   I was talking about meta abanding in.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.760]   I'm just happy that I had culturally relevant.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   You were so.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.400]   You fit right in.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.680]   Meta could revive, according to the information X, R, O, S or some pieces of it at a later
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.280]   date.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.200]   No word why they discontinued it.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.080]   And it could just be a technical issue.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.880]   But it seems to me a capitulation to say, well, we'll just use Google's Android.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.800]   That's exactly what they didn't want to do.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.880]   That's why they were building this, right?
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.840]   I mean, at some point you need hardware to put it on and maybe they couldn't quite solve
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.280]   that problem.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.080]   If not technically, maybe just in terms of supply.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.960]   Maybe, you know, I think this is a blue sky thing.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.120]   I mean, I don't think they expected to have something next year.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.880]   As Reese, this is from the information again, as recently as June Zuckerberg touted the
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.280]   importance of the new AR/VR operating system.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:16.360]   This is in June and said the team is very, is pretty far along at this point.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.000]   And then six months later, that's it.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Never mind.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Never mind.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.760]   So I don't know what to read in the tea leaves.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.720]   You know, in the Apple world, there's a lot of talk about Apple launching its kind of
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:40.120]   VR AR headset at the end of this year for $3,000, a three screen device.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.240]   And then of course, just for Cyclops, what was I don't know what the three, I don't know,
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:49.040]   and in the rumor, they said, we don't know what the third screen would be.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:56.400]   So they got they got two Sony screens, very high resolution, 4K or maybe even 8K screens
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.880]   where your eyes are.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:02.240]   But then they're buying this other OLED screen from Samsung and no one understands.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.880]   Were the eye on the back of your head?
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   Review.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.880]   I don't know.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.080]   I don't know.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.840]   This is to me, again, this is an example of Silicon Valley saying we just got to find
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.040]   the next new thing and we don't really know what it is.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.680]   We're going to do this and I'm less than saying.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.640]   I'm not sure it's actually they're coming up with the next new thing.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.200]   They're following each other.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:32.000]   I mean, yes, I mean, Facebook might even get credit for sort of rebooting the VR stuff,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.520]   but then everybody else has to kind of do it.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.880]   And the buzz words, everybody's got to do the buzz word, whatever is the hot buzz word
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   of the time.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.600]   This is the cool tech like this isn't actually demonstrating a whole lot of innovation.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.360]   It's demonstrating a whole lot of, oh, we must do the cool thing that everybody thinks
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   is the cool thing.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.280]   And that's not necessarily a valuable contribution.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.840]   It is ironic that in Silicon Valley, where in theory you honor the Mavericks, the careers
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.600]   to the crazy ones, and it's just everybody, what is he doing?
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   What's he doing?
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.640]   Let's do that.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.960]   There's a lot of groups thinking that Silicon Valley.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.480]   Speaking of which Samsung has promised a groundbreaking new TV feature NFT support.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.480]   Come on.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   Let me repeat my previous comment about everybody following the buzz words.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.640]   This is like last year when everything was better with a slight coating of blockchain.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:35.320]   Blockchain was the Vegemite of Silicon Valley for a long time.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   That was worth no.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.800]   Yeah, NFT.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:48.080]   And then of course in a related story, Norton, the antivirus company announced that Norton
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.680]   360 will now come with a Bitcoin miner.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.720]   Did we say anti-virus?
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:59.560]   Yeah, basically, we're going to put our own virus in there.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.040]   We'll take 15%, but you could make some money.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.040]   You could.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.800]   Already, if they're notorious for completely bogging your computer down, now you can eat
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.040]   your home with it as well.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   Yeah, it's just one of those jump on the bandwagon.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   Thanks.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.000]   I have a question about Norton.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.600]   Do any of you know their market share?
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.600]   Are people still?
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   You're in Norton?
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   Where?
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.960]   It's Norton and McAfee, both of whom are...
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.960]   Such hard guns of virtue.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.360]   That's the worst I was looking for.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:41.760]   Norton has a 10% market share according to Symantec.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   Symantec.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.760]   Symantec.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   Anyway.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.240]   Remember Symantec back in the morning.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240]   Symantec.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.640]   Norton has a 10%...
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:58.120]   Kaspersky has 8%, something like that in the market.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:03.160]   Yeah, Norton merged with Lifelock, they were spun off, was it Intel?
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.880]   No, they own McAfee.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.880]   That's so confusing.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.880]   Oh, gosh.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   They're really...
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.360]   I wonder how the tech companies have...
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.520]   The security companies have funny origins, shall we say?
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.880]   Between Mr. McAfee and Kaspersky and Russia.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:23.320]   But you know, and in fact, I was reading this article that Harry McCracken did some years
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.880]   ago about Peter Norton and Norton was in his day.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   He was no McAfee.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.960]   He was a legend in his day with his arm folded in his big fat tie on the box of every...
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.800]   But he sold it a long time ago.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.640]   He became an art collector and a philanthropist.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.680]   Symantec, 13% of the market, a vast 12% ESET.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.600]   One of our sponsors, 11% Webroot 8%.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.680]   Actually, McAfee's down there at 8%.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.360]   The silence, bit defender, malware, bytes, trend micro.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.320]   So this is according to Statista.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.160]   Yeah, that's why I was asking because there are so many other options out there that are
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.120]   not going to beat the crap out of your computer.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.880]   I just want us to win the job.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.880]   There was...
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.880]   I think...
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.520]   You have to constantly reassess.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.640]   I've been saying for some time, you probably don't need an antivirus.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.880]   Windows comes with one.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.400]   I've said that too.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.400]   Modern algorithms.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.400]   So we're locked down.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   New York Times had an article.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   You get a Chromebook, people.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.160]   You get a Chromebook and these worries are...
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.720]   You don't need any of it.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   Sure.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.600]   And then New York Times had an article this week saying you probably really don't need
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.240]   a VPN either.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.160]   Which I thought is time to stop paying for a VPN.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.720]   We also have VPN sponsors.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   So I should...
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.160]   I'm shooting myself with a foot here.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.160]   I'm not even good at far, sir.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   I'm not even good at far.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.640]   That's the way you're doing it.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   It depends.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.200]   You know, all of this depends on your threat model.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.440]   There are definitely people who should run antiviruses too.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.520]   If you've got teenage kids using a computer, you might want to put an antivirus on it.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.600]   Oh yeah, there's that.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   Times change.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.880]   Things move along.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.880]   I don't know.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.960]   I don't know what to say.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   But I think...
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.240]   Did we just leave entirely CES?
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.240]   Did we just see...
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.240]   No, no.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.240]   There's still CES.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   That was the Samsung TV.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.240]   They announced that.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.240]   I'm actually waiting.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.240]   I'm trying to figure out because I mentioned this last week, Scott Wilkinson, our home
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.600]   theatre guy, said there is going to be a big announcement at CES.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.360]   A new TV technology.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.840]   That's right here.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.400]   And I'm waiting to find out what it is.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:37.080]   And the best I can figure is Sony has announced a new kind of OLED TV with Quantum dots, which
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.080]   ...
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:44.520]   It can only be run by a quantum computer on the blockchain to show your NFTs.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.760]   I don't know if it doesn't have Scott Bakker and Dean Stockwell.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.760]   Wow.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.960]   There's a reference.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   Wow.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.000]   Okay, you win today.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.280]   You win today's old TV show reference.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   I am amazed at how hit by a beer could be right now.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.120]   I am so impressed.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:12.960]   Sony announced the world's first quantum dot OLED TV, the Bravia XR series.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.680]   So OLED, I think we all agree OLED right now is the best technology out there.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:23.080]   I've been watching down the road for micro LED, which Samsung's been showing.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:31.360]   Sony will also do a micro LED technology, but the QD OLED, supposedly is brighter than
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:38.320]   the old OLEDs, dazzling brightness, deeper blacks, more impressive mid-tones.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.720]   And if you're impressed by that, you'll love the list price.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.640]   I don't actually know, but I'm sure it's very expensive.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.200]   I guess that's what he's talking about.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.360]   I don't see any other big announcements in TVs.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.360]   But you know Samsung projector, which is kind of cute.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.160]   Yeah, they've been projected.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.840]   Oh, yeah, they're short thorough.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.600]   This is more of a consumer product.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   899.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.280]   It's kind of cute.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.880]   It looks like a little can light you might shine on the painting of your ancestors on
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.880]   the wall.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:16.800]   In fact, it's a hair light for those of you in the television business.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.040]   The freestyle, ultra portable, smart TV projector weighs less than two pounds.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.680]   Typically, these don't have great pictures.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.600]   899, 899 dollars, 1080p.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.640]   It can play music and includes 360 sound.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:38.480]   And it has a Samsung smart TV platform on it, which means they can spy on you as well.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   Oh, yay.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.480]   Oh, God.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:46.640]   Well, anchor's version, optical in the anchor brand, is bigger, but it's 4K.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.560]   Anchor actually has had the projectors for several years now.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.360]   So these little portable projectors, I guess this is a category.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:00.560]   I guess if you didn't want anybody to know you had a TV, this would be cute.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.160]   You could see it.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.160]   There's a market.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.160]   Oh, don't laugh, Jeff.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.560]   There are a lot of people that I don't.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   Oh, I've known those people.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.920]   I mean, it's been a former TV critic.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.880]   People used to all the time going to be insane.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.680]   I don't watch TV, or I only watch TV.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.680]   The idiot box.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.040]   I only watch PBS unless I'm watching The Bachelor.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.960]   I always said that how do you know who Vanna White is?
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.240]   You don't have any cultural understanding.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.120]   How are you going to mention, you know, Scott Bakula in a conversation?
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.120]   You got it.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.120]   You got it.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.160]   I need to send a thank you to my parents.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:44.480]   Thank you for having a TV in the house and letting me watch it.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.440]   Remember the LGA Roll-Up TV?
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   This is also a TV designed for people who didn't want anybody to know they have a TV.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.520]   It's just like a credenza, but the TV rolls out of it.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.000]   Notice the price, by the way, says, "inquire to buy."
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.440]   If you have to ask, you can't.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.920]   I think I asked it.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:10.520]   It was $100,000, so it costs a lot to not have a TV.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.800]   Keep it to a period.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.120]   You were talking about the QOLED.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.120]   QOLED.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:24.640]   What gets me is I'm like, "How much better can the television skit now?"
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.360]   Because now who sounds like an old man?
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.200]   Now who sounds like an old man?
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.280]   Yeah, but I mean, don't give me your own.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.400]   8K video is beautiful.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.240]   But there's no content.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:41.840]   But the delivery getting that to the masses is not going to happen anytime soon.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:48.640]   The TV that you have in your lovely home is absolutely beautiful.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.520]   Why is there something else out there even better than that?
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.000]   Can you imagine something being better than what you have in your home?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.640]   Well, I used to think that who needs HD?
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.240]   I was a TV critic for God's sakes.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.720]   I did too.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.920]   I sit down in front of the 4K OLED and I love it.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.640]   Maybe it's a little too real.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   But you really...
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   Yeah, you like this like ridiculous thing.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   Yeah, like you're watching...
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.640]   It's really nice.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.160]   Well, then we have that big projector in the living room.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.160]   That one's huge.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.160]   It's just 100 inches.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.800]   That's not going to get replaced until I think micro LED is the future of that.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.040]   Because those are little...
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.040]   They're squares.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.320]   You can make it as big as you want.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.160]   You just keep attaching them.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:34.680]   But there's some technical issues that they haven't solved yet on the edges and so forth.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.640]   The refresh rates, I see scooter answers mentioned in the IRC.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.920]   Brighter colors, brighter richer colors, better processing, better refresh rates.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.840]   Yeah, all of that makes HDR is a big jump.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.840]   We already have HDR.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840]   It looks great.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.840]   Well, how about H-D-R?
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:56.760]   I still have to go back to the question though of why.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.240]   Because it also... like whether this is better also depends on what you're watching.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:07.720]   So until quite recently, I was watching TV on like a 20 inch CRT monitor and I was perfectly
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.240]   happy because it could deliver what I wanted in a way that whatever I was watching, I could
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.240]   be full of it.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.640]   Quantum Leep looks great on it.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.920]   But if you want to watch any from the 21st century...
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.280]   I have other tastes and preferences than you.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.360]   I want to come up later in the show.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.360]   I am teasing you.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.360]   I did.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:31.760]   I mean, I'm more likely, yes, to watch sort of a public television type thing and show
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.680]   me my actors and show me my drama and like I don't need to see every pour on their face.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.840]   And I don't need the special effects because that's not going to wow me.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.280]   That's going to distract me.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.440]   That's not the thing that goes into what I consider an enjoyable content experience.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   Yeah, but you're an outlier.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.440]   You're an outlier.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.360]   I mean, you just said I was hip.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.360]   I had all knowledge here.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.040]   You're not the mass market.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.040]   I take it back.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.280]   I mean, people watching sports and action movies, that's what they want.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.480]   And what they really, I think what really has driven this is the last two years where
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.280]   you couldn't go to a movie theater and people want a much more immersive and movie theater
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   style.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.120]   Sir, the experience at home.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:14.200]   Netflix is having people shoot in 12K and raw and so forth.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   And it's just absolutely beautiful.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.120]   But it's only going to be so much that they can deliver to us over the internet.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.360]   Well, you're a photography guy.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:30.040]   But people have said, well, you know, why do you need more resolution in the camera?
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:36.440]   Only time I need more resolution is for cropping because there are going to be instances I
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.720]   want to take a portrait of someone or some.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:43.960]   So you wouldn't have you wouldn't say, oh, I need a 41 megapixel image so that I can
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.960]   blow it.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.440]   I don't know what you blow it up the side of a house.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.960]   You don't need it to make it bigger.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.800]   You need it to find the bit that you want to zoom in on it or like a right.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.480]   I don't know what to choose from it.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.440]   So I'll take the big port, big platter of images and then pick what I want to focus
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.440]   on later.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.840]   I guess that's this is the theme that of this show is Silicon Valley has to is like
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.840]   a shark.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:09.000]   It can't sit still has to move forward whether we need to or not.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.880]   And I return to Gutenberg.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.880]   Watch out.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.560]   What's interesting is we got to have this episode.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   We're going to leave drunk.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.520]   What's going to be interesting is not what happens in Silicon Valley.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.680]   It's moving past the technology is what people do with it.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.520]   It becomes interesting technology becomes boring.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.520]   That's when life becomes interesting.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:36.640]   Well, I mean, I keep saying why and not just to be like have a catchphrase, but to basically
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.920]   point out that if you're not answering that question, I think the innovation is just going
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.080]   to slide off.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.240]   It's not going to be meaningful.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.760]   It's not going to find a market.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.920]   But if you actually try to think about the why and think about the use case and think
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.280]   about how people interact with their technology, you know, it's probably better business because
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.920]   you're more likely to be able to mesh with your market because you're meeting what the
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.840]   market can need or might imagine that it needs.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.200]   If you can't answer the why even as your company in a way that people think is plausible,
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.880]   I don't think your business is going to be successful.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.480]   No matter how cool it might actually be.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.760]   Do you think tech companies are doing a good job of that?
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.840]   I mean, I think there's been moments when they have.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.880]   I don't think Silicon Valley on the whole has probably done that very well.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.960]   I think a lot of times you get people were like, I built something.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.440]   It's cool and that the coolness should be able to speak for itself.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.360]   I think the companies that are more successful are the ones that engage with their users,
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:39.280]   do better design, do better research to basically try to meet who the audience was, understand
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:44.600]   the problem they're trying to solve and have a dynamic kind of discussion with their market
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.920]   to figure out, did it work?
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.000]   Sometimes what happens is the market will take something and actually invent a new use
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.120]   and then the company's got to be able to pivot to back that up.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.320]   But if you're listening to your customers and you care and you're actually designing
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.960]   for them and you care about the function and you care about the use and you care about
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.520]   the usability, it's not a guarantee but you're much more likely to be successful than a company
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:12.200]   that doesn't bother and just focuses on the coolness and the 4K, 8K, 12K, whatever stuff
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.240]   you're looking for, your numbers and success in technology is more about just making it
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.240]   flashier.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.640]   It's got to be more useful.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:26.200]   I know this is a really niche population but the photography side of things, Canon and
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.040]   Sony, that's exactly what they did.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:34.080]   They took a lot of feedback from the community and slowly started to implement it into the
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:39.320]   different products out there where that's the less expensive beginner camera all the
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.080]   way up to the pro grade stuff.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.720]   They took a lot of heat over the years because they would do some things that were quite
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:50.120]   asinine but it took note of it and put it in place and they have some really, really
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.880]   great products now.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.600]   I do have to point out that I agree with you.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.640]   100% Kathy, I think that that's exactly what tech companies should be focused on.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:05.960]   However, they've managed to make a pretty good success for themselves without necessarily
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.320]   doing that.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.840]   I don't know.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.880]   So Apple, this week Apple hit $3 trillion in market.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.880]   Are you still there?
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.000]   No, they went back down a little bit.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.320]   If you look at, there's Microsoft right behind them.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.080]   This is from the New York Times, $2.5 trillion.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:28.840]   Alphabet at $1.9 trillion, Amazon at $1.7 trillion, meta almost a trillion.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:35.000]   It's only when you get down below half a trillion that you get to traditional big money companies
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.200]   like Disney and JP Morgan.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:43.440]   And actually, this was the most amazing stat of all.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.840]   Apple's $3 trillion market cap.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.440]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.560]   Makes it worth more than, oh shoot, I can't.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:57.760]   But it was like all the top 10 companies combined.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   Here it is.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:04.280]   Apple's $3 trillion market cap makes them worth more than Walmart, Disney, Netflix, Nike,
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:10.880]   Exxon, Coca-Cola, Comcast, Morgan Stanley, McDonald's, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, Boeing, IBM,
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.720]   and Ford combined.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.720]   That's amazing.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.720]   Add it up.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.680]   Well, Apple is not the exception to what I said.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.720]   They're more proving the rule because one of the things that Apple did and did well and
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.200]   it fueled its success was to actually care about design.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.920]   I don't happen to like their design choices, but a lot of people fell in love with it and
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:37.360]   they were obviously engaged with UI experience, design, touch, feel, and things like that.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.400]   I think the bigger exception is Facebook, which seems incredibly out of touch with how
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.400]   people actually might be inclined to use their product.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.400]   And they keep making it substantively and materially worse because they don't seem to
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.600]   really understand why people were drawn to it in the first place.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.800]   So I think they are the exception, but Apple is not.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.520]   Although once Apple gets big and they've got enough capital to do whatever they want,
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.400]   then they can make plenty of mistakes and it's not really going to matter.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.200]   But they're also able to become bigger in other spaces because they've got the capital
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.360]   and they can invest.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.880]   So they can do hardware, they can do software, they can operate on an IP level, they can
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.960]   operate on a thing level.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.400]   That just gives them an advantage in every sector which can snowball into something as
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:28.480]   big as you describe.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.680]   I feel like Apple though has the same quandary that all these other companies do and that's
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.960]   why they're doing AR as one of their next big pushes.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   Cars.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960]   Cars.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:44.120]   Well, because the phone is where movies were when they got Cinoscope Uncle Leo.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.680]   But what more are you going to do?
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.560]   You know, I agree.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.840]   Maybe that or where our TVs are.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.320]   Maybe we are at the end of where we're peak phones.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:02.120]   So again, where is the modern novel, the essay, where's Montaigne, where's Cérantes, where
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.680]   are those creators who use these tools to do things we couldn't have imagined of?
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   That's what excites me.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.520]   No, I agree with you.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:14.720]   What happens when technology is new is you focus on the technology not on what the technology
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.360]   enables and then after a while you kind of absorb it, you get used to it.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.320]   We're at that stage now with the internet where it's just ubiquitous and everybody kind
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.520]   of accepts it's there.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.640]   I think we've got time to go still where we still see the future in the analog of the
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.640]   past.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:35.520]   Maybe, but everybody under 25 grew up with the internet every moment of their life.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.280]   So I think it's now time for the internet.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.960]   Oh, tours, the people who are really going to create on top of that.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.600]   Nevertheless, Silicon Valley is still looking for the next big thing.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.920]   I mean, Apple can't keep this revenue machine going.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:53.400]   Oh, I'm sure they won't be it because that's not historically where these innovations come
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.400]   from.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.000]   Well, this is why they're all going to Mars.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.160]   I mean, seriously, they ran out of things to do on earth.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.280]   So they're looking for like, you know, what's the thing we can go innovate for?
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.480]   And maybe more power to it.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:12.360]   I mean, there's some issues with the fortunes and the private funding of whatever.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:18.400]   But, you know, I'm not going to look a scanset like innovation that makes the heavens reachable.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.720]   I think that's a good thing for humanity to start innovating towards.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.640]   There's something that makes me really queasy about Apple being worth $3 trillion.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:31.000]   Maybe is that a flaw in me that I just I mean, certainly there seems to be that kind
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.280]   of reaction from Congress and the EU is is it possible for a company to become too rich,
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.360]   too successful, too, too wealthy, too powerful?
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.160]   Is that time to start to success?
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.160]   Yes.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:52.600]   There's a way to start a Waco of the real world, but Waco, Waco is fading into nothingness,
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.600]   right?
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.640]   And it's and and and that's actually one of the interesting subtexts of succession, isn't
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.640]   it?
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.200]   Is that it's an old media company trying to figure out what and the and the old guy, the
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.440]   runs the company is going to is full speed.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.080]   He wants to buy TV stations full speed ahead.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.680]   And the subtext is his kids who are complete screw ups.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.360]   All are all saying, no, we got to go digital.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.120]   We got to get the next big thing.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.800]   What are you doing, dad?
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:23.720]   It's an interesting subtext because they are screw ups.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.520]   And he's continues to be the, you know, the top dog and all this top dog.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.520]   I don't know.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.520]   So is this a flaw?
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.520]   Let me ask Kathy.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.520]   Is this because you don't know me.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.720]   Is this a flaw in my personality that it bothers me that apples is.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.520]   They already hate me.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.920]   So that that Apple is this powerful and this rich.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.120]   Does that that bothers me?
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.360]   I don't think any company should get this rich.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.320]   The framing of this question is interesting.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:54.960]   You know, I think it's, I have trepidation answering this because I'm afraid of the regulatory
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.000]   response if it turns out that this is actually icky.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   But I don't think you're weird to feel icky about it.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.760]   So, you know, it's one of the things of, I can't say that we shouldn't maybe ask some
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.120]   questions about how did this happen and is this a good thing and how do we make sure that
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.720]   it's not a bad thing?
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.200]   That's reasonable.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:20.120]   But it's hard for me to be very enthusiastic of like down with this sort of thing because
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.720]   I keep seeing what comes out of Congress where they want to be down with this sort of thing
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:30.040]   and it's some really bad ideas that don't necessarily fix any of the ickiness and basically
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.800]   make it that like goodbye innovation, goodbye future capitalism, goodbye future success of
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.720]   any sort of companies like they end up salting the earth for all sorts of other things that
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.600]   we might actually want to have like smaller companies rising up to be successful and be
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.440]   competitors and things like that.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:49.360]   So there be dragons, but you know, the overall instinct that you're articulating of this
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.520]   kind of feels icky.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.120]   I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to feel.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.600]   Some would say it's kind of anti-American.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   I mean, we celebrate success and-
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.720]   Well, no, because I think our story is competition.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.640]   Like you want to have the best win and the thing that we sort of feel is if they're too
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.120]   big, then you start to worry that the best isn't winning, but like the lucky is the
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.240]   most privileged or something like that where it doesn't really feel like we're rewarding
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.720]   the best, we're just rewarding the biggest and that doesn't feel good with the American
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.160]   mythology, I don't think.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.000]   Jeff Bezos is a nine wheel.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.960]   Success breeds success and you've got this flywheel and pretty soon it doesn't matter
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.400]   if you innovate or you do good for people or if it's a valuable company, it just does
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.600]   it succeeds because it's that big.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.680]   I mean, we don't remember Carnegie because of the railroads.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.960]   We remember him because he funded other stuff with his riches.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.760]   So maybe that was a dysfunctional way to get this other stuff funded, but it's the thing
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:48.520]   that we seem to value more than we actually cared about his capitalist or all gopolas
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.520]   practices.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:55.400]   I think that's another American pathology because Carnegie wanted to revitalize his reputation.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   So he started doing a lot of libraries.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:01.480]   I mean, I don't want to necessarily redeem the whole, how did he go from a robber baron
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:06.800]   to somebody that we like in history, but I'm noting that the pivot point of what we remember
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.680]   and appreciate was not him being the capitalist, but him being the.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.720]   That's what Bill Gates is opening as well.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.760]   You know, I don't think it worked by the way.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.280]   I think it's working for Bill because people see him now as yeah, he's the guy who got
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.280]   the world vaccinated, not it did, but I don't think it's working quite as well.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:28.840]   I think he's made a couple of recent decisions that have undone his PR campaign.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.200]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:37.640]   We'll making all of this money considering that they go about it pretty smart with efficiency
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:43.640]   and control in the whole stack and so forth and just really making their profit margins
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.960]   is just so much bigger.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.680]   That's a that's business.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:52.160]   My problem is the fact that they pay a lot less taxes than regular Joe's like us.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.280]   You know, that that's the problem I've always had with these big tech companies.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.640]   They're able to swindle around the system.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.440]   That's a I mean, that's a flow with the tax code.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:05.720]   I mean, that's the that's one thing you can go to Congress and say, hey, fix that.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:11.600]   There should not be a lobby against us with their deep pockets and keep things the way
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   to.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.840]   Well, that's one thing you get with $3 trillion.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.840]   You get a trillion.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.840]   You can really use it to improve your fortunes.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.000]   I mean, I I'm a fan.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.780]   I don't mind regulatory responses, but I don't like reactive ones and I don't like ones
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.680]   that don't understand the problems they're trying to solve.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.480]   There's complexity and there's things are interdependent and nuanced and you really
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.200]   need to understand what's wrong, why it's wrong, what the interplay is with things that
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.560]   might even be right before you start trying to fix things.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.840]   And the problem is is the icky or something seems the more problematic it seems, the more
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:54.920]   it it is a regulatory response that is overreactive, not appropriately tailored for the solution
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:58.480]   and either won't fix it and or will create a whole bunch of new problems that you didn't
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.680]   bother to anticipate because this seemed like a really good thing that you could score political
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.680]   points on.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.480]   So I don't mind a conversation about like, what is wrong?
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.680]   Let's dig into that.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.680]   It's not like, oh, capitalism, but let's think are there are there things in the tax code?
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.840]   Are there things in the way we do corporate structures?
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.280]   Are there is IP laws?
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.800]   You know, there's a lot of things going on and they're worth a look to figure out, are
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.360]   they accidentally even if we thought they were good?
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.520]   Are they having some byproducts that aren't good?
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.560]   Those are fair questions to ask.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.480]   But then I pull the reins when people are like, well, it's simple.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.800]   Let's just do this instead.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   And it's never that simple.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.680]   And you have to be much more careful or else you ruin things that you actually did value.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.800]   Bingo, Bingo.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.480]   But this is the way this is how it works.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.760]   This is the conversation starts.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.000]   People propose things and other people say, well, that's not good.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.560]   And we go back and forth.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.160]   Isn't that part of the process?
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.360]   Is the brainstorming in effect?
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.480]   I wouldn't mind the brainstorming, but we tend to have like, you know, actual and potentially
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.440]   terrible bills that end up proposed and sometimes get escape velocity where all of a sudden
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.600]   they end up on the books before you could really think twice about them.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   So in terms of the process, I'm all for the brainstorming.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.200]   I'm all for like good hearings.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   I'm good.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.600]   You know, let's make a record where we really understand what's going on and then figure
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.640]   out what the appropriate solution would be.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   That's fine.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.960]   The problem is that's not necessarily what we're doing.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:30.960]   Maybe the gridlock in Washington is saving us from that because we haven't accomplished
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.680]   a bloody thing in less than a couple of years.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.960]   Well, things do escape.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.440]   I mean, part of the problem with gridlock is then things kind of get through and sometimes,
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:44.640]   I mean, yeah, sometimes there's cynical reasons why a big company is going to push against,
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.160]   you know, some of these ideas and maybe they're doing it for cynical reasons, but sometimes
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.120]   they're also kind of saving the entire ecosystem.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.720]   And, you know, they may be doing it for their own selfish purposes, but they may actually
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.720]   be having selfish purposes, but it doesn't really matter.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.360]   Sometimes the thing that they want, even if they want it for themselves, turns out to
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.360]   actually be the right thing.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.880]   And if we tend to be like, well, down with big companies, down with big tech, things like
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.200]   that, then we may rob ourselves and blind ourselves to the fact that like doing the opposite of
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.920]   what they're asking for might actually, it might hurt us if we, you know, just reject
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.200]   it out of hand.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:23.040]   To some degree, probably because of Adam Smith, I feel like our system is, and because of
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:30.160]   our court system, our system is based around advocacy and everybody arguing their own best
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.880]   interest.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:38.640]   And then we somehow, if it works, come to some solution that is a good compromise.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.680]   I don't know if that's worked in the last few years, but it's worked in the past.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:49.160]   Let me ask you about this, Kathy, because you're probably right on the cusp of this one.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.120]   You know, Facebook's been running these ads lately, essentially saying, yeah, you got
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.160]   to fix 230.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.160]   They're not acting.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.480]   They're not nice to say about their ad campaign.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.480]   Yeah, they're not.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:04.320]   I mean, I'm trying to figure out who the message is for.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.480]   Is it for politically active people who watch football games who might write to their member
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   of Congress?
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.480]   Is it for Congress?
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:16.520]   I don't think it's probably very well targeted, but it's so dumb.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.600]   It's dumb for them, and it's dumb for the ecosystem.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.160]   It makes them a terrible neighbor.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.520]   But I think the reason that they thought it might be a good idea, and I don't want to,
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:27.200]   it isn't a good idea, but the reason they might have thought so, is there's a certain
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:33.920]   bit where tech in general, because it's such a regulatory target at the moment, has sort
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:37.840]   of a political problem, which is, you know, all these ideas are coming at them, and they're
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.360]   all kind of terrible.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:44.280]   But if you just say no, no, no, no, then everyone thinks you're, you don't look like you care.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   You don't like you're playing.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.520]   I think they tried to say, like, here's a bone that we're throwing, look, we're trying
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.760]   to play blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.120]   So I think they were trying to, like, look, you know, it's a campaign to make them look
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.800]   like they're not recalcitrant.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.720]   They actually, like, care about their impact and stuff like that.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:02.520]   And I think it's trying to rehabilitate the perception that not necessarily the public
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:08.640]   has, but although maybe that a little bit, but that Congress has about it, like, they're
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.240]   not popular there.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.520]   But it's a terrible idea.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:17.160]   I don't think they really understand just how flammable the fire is that they're playing
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.840]   with doing this.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.760]   What they're calling for won't help them.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.440]   We'll hurt them in ways that I don't think they're quite calculating.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.880]   But they're best positioned to weather those regulatory wins, and it will devastate the
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.360]   rest of the ecosystem.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.800]   So a lot of people look at it very cynically.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.440]   I don't know if I share it, but I think it's credible to look at it this way, which is,
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:44.120]   you know, we think that Facebook might be too big and has some anti-competitive tendencies.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:49.640]   This kind of looks like another one, those anti-competitive tendencies because it looks
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.400]   like let's call for regulation that a little glitterator and will be fine.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:58.480]   I don't think they will be as fine as they think, but, you know, that might be motivating
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.560]   them and that isn't good either because it will be so devastating to the individualized
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.560]   that are not.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   Right, Kathy.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:08.800]   It's a case of regulatory captures will be fine and the others won't be.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:13.000]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's poor regulatory capture because I don't think it's effective
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.760]   for them either.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:21.720]   But that is a read of it and that is a plausible read, even if it's not actually what's motivating
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.720]   them.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.920]   I mean, I do think the bit about the PR and the rehabilitative and trying to look like
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.960]   they're a team player with regulators is probably the big thing, but the effect of
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.680]   it will be so devastating.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.320]   And oh, what a shame if we happen to lose our competition.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.440]   So yeah, maybe the cynicism isn't misplaced.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:45.960]   How sick do you get you and Mike Baznick and Jeff Kosseff plus Daphne Keller and Kate
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.360]   Clonick are all my heroes.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.000]   The tech chair through the crew.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Okay.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Well, and more.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.120]   Those are the defenders of internet freedoms versus the idiots about 230.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.760]   How sick do you get of going over the same territory with people?
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:06.240]   You know, I have to be more patient than my personality necessarily accounts for because
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:12.360]   I think that part of the problem is there's a lot of political pressure on Congress and
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:16.080]   I've talked to some people on the Hill and they're kind of like, look, we get it.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.400]   We understand that changing section 230 is bad, but we have all these people who are
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.840]   looking at like, you know, bad stuff that seems to be happening because the internet
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.640]   enables bad stuff to happen.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.880]   And people are saying do something about it.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.320]   And they're like, how can we go back to our constituency and not do something?
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:34.800]   You know, we need to be able to do something or else we won't get reelected because we
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.560]   look like we're unresponsive.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:42.160]   So I think the key is my goal and I'm happy to be here on this program because it kind
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.520]   of is a step towards meeting that end, which is I think we have to talk to people who are
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.680]   not the experts.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.120]   I mean, I think people who are in the space, yeah, how sick do I get?
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.800]   The people who should know better and not knowing better?
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.200]   That's really annoying.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:01.520]   But regular people who don't spend their days thinking about law, thinking about tech, you
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.120]   know, they have political will.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.120]   This is a democracy.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.040]   They can choose the laws that regulate them.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:09.640]   So how do you educate them so they can ask for good things?
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:14.320]   And I think that's the key to talk to lay audiences for whom there's trusted people
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.680]   that they can believe to say, let me understand this a little bit better because then when
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.520]   they call their members of Congress, they will ask for things that are actually more
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.960]   useful than just do something, burn it all down.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   What do I care?
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.200]   You know, I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.200]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:59.000]   Show that you care and not worry because government has a lot of other things to worry
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.800]   about, much more important.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.480]   It doesn't seem to be very effective at getting anything done anyway.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:10.000]   What's the chance that you get into trouble?
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.880]   I mean, it's a huge company with a ton of people.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.840]   One of the things that I think is not part of our policy discussion enough is how do
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   you steer a big company like that?
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.040]   You've got a lot of people.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.120]   You've got a lot of smart people.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.400]   You've probably got a couple idiots as well.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.080]   How do you steer that?
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.320]   I know there's good people.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.680]   I know there's principled people.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:34.960]   I know there's people who would really like to direct the company to be a good corporate
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.960]   citizen.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.800]   I know there's people who would like them to push for good policy.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.480]   There's probably also some cynical people.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.680]   Then there's some people who are well-meaning and also wrong.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:50.160]   They're all there and they've all got an oar, but the boat can go in circles.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:56.000]   How do you actually make that company steer as a coherent ship?
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.280]   You could write PhDs about organizational theory about how do these companies manage
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:04.040]   themselves when you've got all this talent.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.280]   It's so unwieldy.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:11.040]   Facebook is unique because so much goes to that C-suite where just a couple of people
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.760]   have a lot of control.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.040]   This is not great when they are missing the point.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:21.480]   We talked earlier that we think Mark Zuckerberg really doesn't into it enough what the effect
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:25.520]   is of his product and the space that he's in.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:30.120]   On the other hand, maybe that's good when the corporate structure does know because you've
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:33.520]   got a single point of contact that can create a coherent voice.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:37.840]   Right now you've got a really weird hierarchy where you've got a couple of people who can
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.120]   actually make the decisions, but an awful lot of other talent who might want to direct
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.560]   things, but they may not all agree on which direction they should be directing things
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:45.560]   either.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:50.800]   I don't entirely know how we fix it, but we should understand that that's a dynamic.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.640]   When we deal with Facebook to understand what it is that we're dealing with because it's
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.720]   not necessarily the cult of a personality.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:01.520]   It's something more complex than that.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.080]   Let me take a little break.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.080]   We'll come back.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.080]   It's so great to have you.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.080]   Cathy Gellis is with us.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.880]   She's an intellectual property.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.560]   No, you're not really IP law so much.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.360]   I do internet law.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.360]   Internet law.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.160]   Free speech lawyer, but that runs the gamut of all sorts of things that when speech and
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.600]   technology intersect, you've got to play with all this stuff.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:21.600]   Perfect.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.920]   Contributor at TechDirt.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.080]   Very glad to have her.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:32.400]   She's her website, C-G-C-O-U-N-S-E-L, counsel.com.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.720]   Jeff Jarvis also here.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.880]   Great to have him back.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.440]   You look less pink than usual.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.440]   Did you change your life boss?
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:38.440]   Yeah, I thought we got it.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.440]   No, I think we fixed it.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.440]   I think we fixed it.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.440]   I got my old version of the lamp.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.440]   Yeah, he looks good.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:43.440]   He's pretty good.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:47.600]   And of course, Aunt Pruitt, who always looks good, he can't not look good.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.560]   It's just not way he's built.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.440]   He's looking more pink with that shirt, though.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.360]   I like the shirt.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.920]   I like the shirt.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.920]   It's good.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:57.920]   I showed it.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.680]   I brought to you by Hour Crowd.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:02.560]   This is a really interesting company.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.360]   Doing something I think is very interesting.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.520]   He's not for everybody.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.720]   You have to be an accredited investor to get involved.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:13.240]   Hour Crowd is a venture capital firm.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.120]   They have accredited investors.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.600]   They've got deal flow.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.400]   They're looking at a lot of companies.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.280]   They specialize in the global private market.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.360]   These are not companies that have gone public.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:29.800]   They're looking for companies, tech companies that are innovating, driving returns for investors,
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:34.480]   companies that might even have big exits, whether it's IPOs or sales.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:39.240]   They're looking to get in early, in other words, from personalized medicine to cybersecurity
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:44.200]   to robotics, quantum computing.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:48.760]   In state of the art labs and startup garages and anywhere in between, Hour Crowd is identifying
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.560]   innovators.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:56.720]   What's great is you get to participate when the growth potential is earliest, right at
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.720]   the beginning.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.120]   That's the highest potential for growth.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.840]   Hour Crowds, accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars in growing
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.320]   tech companies.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:12.840]   21 of their portfolio companies are unicorns, over 40 IPOs or sale exits.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.280]   It's a really interesting idea.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:19.520]   Basically, they're sharing what they know with you and giving you a chance to participate.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.840]   What's nice is you can get involved for free.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:27.480]   You can sign up at hourcrowd.com/twig and get involved in the deal flow.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:33.800]   The first thing you're going to have to do, though, is go to the site, sign up, and input
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.600]   the country you're investing from.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.080]   Every country has different rules for being an accredited investor.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.280]   This is for somebody who meets those requirements.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.840]   If you are an accredited investor in your nation, you could participate in single company deals
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.560]   for as little as $10,000.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.000]   They have funds, too.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.400]   You can get into Hour Crowds funds.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.880]   Those are a bigger investment, $50,000.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.960]   You do have to have a minimum of $10,000 in order to invest, but you don't have to invest
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.120]   right up front.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.240]   The whole idea is you can join Hour Crowd.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.920]   You can look at these new companies, see where they're going.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.040]   The investment terms are going to vary depending on where you invest.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040]   I'll give you an example.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.880]   I don't know if it's-- yeah, there it is on the left.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.880]   Blue Tree.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.880]   This is really interesting.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:22.000]   This is a company that could revolutionize the billion-dollar-plus total addressable food
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.760]   tech market.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:29.600]   What they have is they've developed a process that reduces the sugar significantly in any
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:35.840]   natural liquid without reducing the taste.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.120]   I mean, somebody who drinks fruit juice, you would say, "That sounds great.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.160]   Health risks are lowered, but the taste is there.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:50.320]   Blue Tree is already signed a five-year 100 million-liter contract with an industry leader, but they're
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.320]   not public yet.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.880]   In fact, you probably have never heard their name.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.520]   They're just getting started, but you can invest in them today at Hour Crowd.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.520]   I just use that as an example.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.840]   I just use that as an example.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:07.000]   There's lots of other startups at Hour Crowd.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.400]   Invest in Blue Tree or any of their startups or invest in their funds.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:18.640]   OURCROWD.com/Twig.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.400]   It's free to join, and this is what I would suggest doing.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:27.640]   Go there and see what the requirements are for being an accredited investor because every
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.680]   country has their own laws about that.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.440]   It's really not for somebody just starting out.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.680]   There's obviously other things you should do to build your wealth, but this is for somebody
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.080]   who's looking for diversification, interesting new investment opportunities.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:49.480]   Maybe somebody like you and I who maybe started covering this industry for years watching these
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:50.480]   companies exploding.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.000]   Boy, I'd like to be in at the beginning of the next one.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.760]   OURCROWD.com/Twig.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:05.960]   Join the fastest growing venture capital investment community, HourCrowd.com/Twig.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.440]   I love getting an advertiser that's doing something unique.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.200]   This is a really interesting business.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.600]   HourCrowd.com/Twig.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.880]   Thank you so much for your support of this week in Google HourCrowd.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:22.360]   You, dear listeners and viewers, support us when you use that special address.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.520]   Make sure you do that so they know you saw it here.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.800]   HourCrowd.com/Twig.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   We don't want them to think Joe Rogan sent you.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.240]   Did you see, by the way, it was in the verge yesterday.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.000]   I sent this to Lisa.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.800]   This is inside baseball.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.600]   Nobody cares about this.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.440]   But podcasters who are using, we've always relied on what you just saw, which was a
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.000]   host red endorsement kind of, and baked in.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.480]   But more and more podcasters are doing the programmatic advertising.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.040]   We started playing with that a little bit.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:09.280]   The Verge had a long article about how poorly it's working for people.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.280]   This is the plan.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.440]   We've talked about this before.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.160]   This is what Spotify is doing.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.800]   In fact, that's the number one programmatic company they bought.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.960]   The megaphone, which we use.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:27.160]   It's part of their Spotify span, Spotify ad network.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.040]   I thought this was an interesting article, but it's a little inside baseball.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.160]   So podcasters are letting software pick their ads.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.920]   It's already going right.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.520]   I love it.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.520]   Let it go right.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.280]   Meanwhile, did you see that NPR is going, I didn't put this in the rundown, but since
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.520]   we're inside the baseball diamond right now.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.880]   We're going to put up subscriber only material.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.600]   The whole point of public media is at the whole point.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   Oh, that's disappointing.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   What do you do?
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.600]   What?
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.080]   That's your public radio.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   Oh, Jeff.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.080]   He's real timers.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:06.080]   Jeff, I hate to point you to something that's in the rundown.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:13.680]   But you should read the comment that NPR filed before the copyright office and the study
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.520]   of the ancillary right for news publications.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.320]   I want to get to this.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:23.520]   You will not like it given what you just said that the point of public broadcasting is that
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.880]   the public can get access to it and they are pushing for an ancillary right that would
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:37.600]   allow essentially cause a statutory license to exist for any of these platforms or what
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:44.480]   I call audience facilitating services that they were very clear in the testimony.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.840]   We don't mean a link text.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:51.080]   It's the idea that anybody is aggregating anything else on the internet to direct audience to
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.440]   these other sites.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   How dare you do this?
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.280]   How dare you make money associated with it?
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:02.920]   That should be ours because we need the money to and NPR came out in favor of yes, we should
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.520]   totally have this game because we need money to.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.000]   And I think it's completely country.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   What you call a tax.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.520]   Sorry, what you call a tax.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.240]   I call a life to go should threat.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.960]   Yeah, because he likes to say that word.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.880]   Kathy's your piece on this.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.120]   I didn't know that this discussion was as far along as it was in this country.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:26.360]   I thought it was only happening in Germany and the EU and Canada and Australia.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:32.280]   But the lobbying power of old media apparently is working here too.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.240]   Why don't you summarize if I maybe some bold since you brought it up and I think it's a
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.440]   wonderful piece of your arguments.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.640]   I mean, our arguments.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.280]   This is a terrible idea.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:53.600]   Our arguments is that this is a completely inappropriate use of copyright.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:59.440]   That the point of copyright is to make sure that the public has access to puts up walls
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.640]   to that.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:07.820]   And it's economically infeasible, dumb, stupid, cumbersome, costly and really detrimental
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:12.600]   to the financial interests of any smaller publications that exist in the long tail where
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.980]   any revenue it's going to collect is going to go to big players and small players aren't
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:19.060]   going to get a significant piece of the pie.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:25.900]   But meanwhile, the services they depend on to have their expression reach audiences is
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.700]   not going to be able to get there because the services are going to be disincentivized
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:33.560]   to provide the services of directing attention to anybody.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.720]   You won't get the services.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.060]   You won't get the platforms.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:40.380]   You'll have fewer choices and you'll just be shouting in the wind with your own publication
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:44.100]   because you don't have those intermediating services to help connect you to audiences
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:48.260]   because they can't afford to because we decided to pick their pocket for how dare you actually
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:52.500]   make money doing us a favor and giving us the audiences we have always said that we
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:56.140]   want it needed in order to be viable entities economically.
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:01.540]   So this is killing the golden goose on an enormous scale if they actually go forward
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:06.940]   with it and really detrimental to anybody smaller who doesn't agree that that's in
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:10.300]   their financial or expressive best interests.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:15.820]   I love that you put it this way in your argument is that you think you're doing something
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:16.820]   good here.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.860]   You would think that we a tech dirt would like this because oh we want to get paid for
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:20.860]   our stuff.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:26.340]   But in fact, you're hurting us and a tech dirt speaking protector and thus you're hurting
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.580]   the competition you supposedly want to foster.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:35.140]   So the big guys see previous discussions about regulatory capture are the ones who win and
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:39.820]   small guys and new guys lose and so we all lose and we all lose our freedoms.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:42.420]   And this is just abhorrent that it's gotten this far.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.420]   I didn't know it.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.460]   My blood pressure would be a lot higher if I'd known it.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:53.420]   Yeah, I've had this ignorance sometimes is medically necessary bliss.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   I mean at the testimony that they had, you know, there's on the one hand they're like,
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.820]   oh, we need another Google.
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:00.980]   Google has too much power.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.900]   And it's like, but you don't see that if you do regulatory schemes like this, you're
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:08.340]   salting the earth and making it impossible to have anybody go into the business of doing
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:12.860]   anything that's going to direct attention to any of these sites anywhere.
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.700]   Like you won't get your other Google.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:20.140]   You're going to solve a monopoly power essentially by stoking more monopoly power.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.940]   Just put it somewhere else.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:22.940]   None of this is logical.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:24.860]   None of this is rational.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:27.220]   None of this is a good idea.
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:33.580]   It's undercooked and really rather greedy and entitled where the common theme was how
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:36.980]   dare any of these people based on giving us audience.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.100]   If there's any money to be had by sending people to us, then that's our money and we
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.740]   need a piece of it or all of it.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.060]   But the bad guys this time.
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.420]   That's a sensible reason to think that.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.420]   Sorry, Kathy.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   Do we delay?
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:48.980]   No, I mean, I can't hear you.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:49.980]   Oh, yes.
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.180]   I thought I'm so I apologize.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.860]   I was not trying to cut you off though.
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860]   I just know.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:55.860]   Tell me what you were saying about the bad guys.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:00.220]   So so in the previous prior discussion about Facebook and its campaign to say, oh, we're
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.900]   fine with doing 230.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:04.020]   That's regulatory capture on their staff.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.420]   The bad guys in this case are big old media.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.220]   In this case, the platforms don't want to do this.
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:15.340]   They don't want to ever be in a position of paying for what we used to call content.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:19.100]   They don't want to be paying for links, but they get forced into it.
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.740]   That's what happened in Australia where they say, okay, here's back sheesh.
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:27.100]   We will bribe you into not pushing this law so far that everybody screwed.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:31.060]   And in that case, Facebook did the right thing more than Google by saying, fine, we'll leave
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.900]   Australia.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.700]   And so then now it's going to happen in Canada.
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.020]   Now it's happening in the EU.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:42.700]   And now it's happening here where it is big old media who never acknowledged the conflict
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.620]   of interest they have when they cover the internet, who see the internet as a competitor.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.340]   They went after radio this way.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.860]   They went after billboards this way.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.620]   They went after television this way.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.580]   And now they're just going after the internet this way, the way they always have.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:11:00.300]   They cash in their political capital to get protectionist legislation passed.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.780]   And that's what's happening here.
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:07.300]   And it's my colleagues in big old media who were screwing you guys, you Leo too, and you
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:12.420]   Kathy and Mike, a tech dirt, the small and new guys.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.540]   And it thus it affects all of our freedoms.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:18.780]   Well, it does affect everybody, but I wouldn't necessarily focus on just the big old incumbents.
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:19.780]   There is that.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:21.100]   I don't want to say that that's wrong.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.500]   But that's not a complete enough picture about people jostling with this.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.420]   Because you will see some of the smaller ones also thinking it's a good idea.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:33.540]   I mean, this is really what we saw with music copyright, where you had a lot of big incumbent
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:39.020]   record companies and big incumbent artists who decided this having compulsory licenses
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.580]   would be good for them.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:45.700]   And they sold a line to all the way down the spectrum to midsize and smaller where, oh,
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:46.940]   yeah, this is good for you.
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.100]   You need this too.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:53.620]   And so a lot of people who really don't realize the consequences are also calling up and asking
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:54.620]   for these things.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.620]   So.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.700]   What about the buzzfeeds and the boxes now that they're getting bigger and they're consolidating?
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.700]   Are they basically just big old guys now or not?
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.700]   I don't know.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:03.700]   I mean, this was really depressing.
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.540]   There were, you know, a lot of it also is that people aren't necessarily advocating directly.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:11.380]   They're also advocating via organizations and the organizations are taking strange lines.
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:17.140]   Like, I do find it weird that, you know, the news media in particular really needs the
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:24.140]   First Amendment to function and pushing for any sort of law that has an anti-First Amendment
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:28.820]   consequence to it by chilling expression really seems like something they should be very careful
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.820]   about.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:34.260]   And Jocelyn in the copyright space is really not going to pay off for them in the long
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:37.500]   run because it turns a lot of barriers to expression.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.780]   And this seems like the industry more than any others that should really understand how
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:46.220]   important it is not to have barriers to expression if you're going to be able to express yourself.
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.620]   So was this constitutional in the United States?
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.380]   Do you think, God knows what the courts we have now?
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:56.660]   Imagine it's 10 years ago when we had courts and you had the opportunity to argue it.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:01.100]   Do you think that a, it's not a copyright in the US is constitutional?
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.020]   Well, there's a couple ways to think about it.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:07.500]   One, whether this is consistent with the progress clause itself, I think it's antithetical
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.540]   to promoting the progress of science and the useful arts.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:15.700]   That hasn't necessarily stopped copyright from developing and hardening and expanding
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.420]   over the years, however.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:21.020]   And the second bit is copyright also exists in tension with the First Amendment, particularly
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.580]   as it starts to put barriers down.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.220]   And we'll kind of ignore that tension as well.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:34.220]   I think it does stand, this is a very naked emperor and nobody's paying attention to the
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.860]   kind of conflict we're setting up.
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:39.940]   There's so, so many people are so enamored with the idea that copyright can give people
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:43.180]   something that they have and why would they ever want to let go of it.
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:47.180]   And it just blinds people to the reality of, well, what does it mean when that right is
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:53.620]   so long lasting, impenetrable, uncharable, taking away from public domain, taking away
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:57.980]   from fair use, the effects on the internet with the DMCA and all the prior restraint that
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:02.180]   that causes, people don't look at the collateral damage because they've kind of bought into
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:06.860]   the idea that copyright was something that they could just have and how dare anybody
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.020]   take it away.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.540]   But this is a really modern development.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.980]   It wasn't always like this.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.300]   It wasn't supposed to be like this because now all of a sudden copyright is doing the
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:18.460]   exact opposite of what it was ever intended to do.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.260]   It's shutting things down.
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:23.660]   It's slowing the sharing of ideas and information.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.980]   It's showing, it's shutting down expression and, you know, the Constitution is kind of
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.220]   built around the idea that democracy is going to work.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.740]   That's not the thing that should be happening.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.420]   It should be the exact opposite.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:41.340]   Well, I didn't realize until I started researching my Gutenberg book how much the origins of
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:46.300]   copyright in 1710, you're a legal scholar and I'm not and I don't play one on podcasting.
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.940]   But I didn't fully realize how it wasn't the authors who fought for it.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:55.220]   It was the publishers who fought for it so that they had a tradable asset so that they
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:59.780]   could acquire the copyright from the author and then they could sell it around and they
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:03.140]   had an asset that could grow in value for them.
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.500]   It wasn't a protected authors at all.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.500]   It was to create a marketplace.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.100]   Well, I wasn't necessarily the correct author.
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.100]   Yeah, it does.
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.540]   Yeah, it does.
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:17.300]   So before they had copyright, they had the royal privilege.
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:18.300]   License.
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:19.300]   Forget how it's called.
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:23.700]   Yeah, the royal print license where it didn't involve an author at all but it basically was,
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.580]   could you print only if the king said so?
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:32.820]   And he wouldn't necessarily say so directly but he would empower about four or five, like
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.220]   the royal stationers company.
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:37.300]   They were the people who were allowed, they had the license to print.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:43.780]   So they decided what would be acceptable to go into publication which was incredibly
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:53.860]   censoring and as there were more democratic forces getting more leverage in England, that
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:57.380]   act kept expiring and eventually they couldn't renew it.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:01.300]   So eventually they cooked up something called the statute of man which comes out completely
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.260]   differently where it's a statute for learning.
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:08.340]   And it did put rights in the hands of authors where there was more of a personal ownership
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:13.620]   to it but the idea was something, it really did shift in terms of its regulatory language
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:19.100]   and all the packaging around it that it was a statute for learning because we recognize
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:24.780]   the value in people having access to written information that people can then share.
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:29.900]   I've heard what you've said before that actually this was sort of a cynical calculation by
[01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:33.580]   the people who just wanted to sort of make sure they got leverage under the new system
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:40.460]   and this was the new system designed to make publishers do fine and it really wasn't about
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.460]   the authors.
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:45.900]   But it was still in principle a much better thing for the public and it really did sort
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.500]   of increase public discourse.
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:52.060]   People could go to pubs and talk about things because they could share their pamphlets with
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:56.460]   each other and it really did have a sort of if you want democracy this is the kind of
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:01.300]   thing you're going to need to have so people are informed and able to exchange information.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:06.740]   It was limited, it didn't last forever, the rights were you know you get some exclusive
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:10.380]   rights but the public could still do things and as it was brought to the United States
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:14.700]   it was brought over with the balance of what is what you need just to make sure you don't
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:18.540]   have market failure because we want to make sure that people are still producing written
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:21.620]   stuff but that's all you need.
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:26.260]   The point of having this whole system is to make sure that the public gets access to all
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:27.460]   this knowledge.
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:32.340]   So if you create a system that takes it away from the public you're not doing what you
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:37.420]   were supposed to do and it's not the way the copyright was written in the founding days
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.100]   of America at all.
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:43.100]   It's really divorced from what those principles were at this point.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:52.380]   So this was all triggered by a phrase called ancillary copyright which I think is probably
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.540]   a term of art that isn't widely known by people in our audience.
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.780]   I don't want to patronize anybody if you've been following this.
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:17:59.780]   I'm happy.
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.500]   Please patronize me.
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:09.220]   But I think Kathy and Jeff know what ancillary copyright means and now having read your pleading
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:16.220]   and listen to you I understand it better but we should explain.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:20.820]   This is by the way the copyright office asking for comment I think the comments period is
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.620]   over now right.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:27.940]   Today is a deadline for a reply comment so yes functionally it's going to be over.
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:33.940]   But they're asking for comment on the behalf of Congress.
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:40.740]   How first of all is Congress considering modifying the copyright law in this way?
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:45.020]   Is that something they're actually considering right now?
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.460]   Some yes.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:52.380]   Where that is in terms of actually producing a bill I don't know if there's you know the
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:57.020]   turnaround time to go from this idea to something where we actually have to vote on it.
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:59.060]   There may be some amount of time.
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.540]   Maybe this is more than days.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.300]   That's the time to bring it up.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.860]   There's a letter from people in the Hill.
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:07.660]   It's legitimate because this has happened in Europe.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:13.180]   In fact you quote in your brief you quote this what happened in Spain and we've talked
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:19.860]   about this on a show before where the Spanish government said no no Google you've got to
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:26.540]   pay money to newspapers if you if you put them in your search results if you put their
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.380]   snippets in your search results.
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:31.700]   Google's response was fine no Google news for you.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:36.940]   I think Spain capitulated as I remember not only only very recently the only in the last
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:42.780]   few two months did a new law occur based on different European law that allows the law
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:43.780]   to go back.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:44.780]   So there's no.
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.780]   So there's no.
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:52.580]   The notion of ancillary copyright is essentially saying we want to amend copyright law so that
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:58.140]   the newspapers the publishers have some additional interest in what you do with it.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:04.620]   Jeff Hughes the phrase link tax which is sometimes what this boils down to is actually if if
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:09.380]   if tech dirt wants to write an article about an article in the New York Times that the
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.700]   New York Times would somehow share in the revenue.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.380]   Is that what we're talking about?
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:16.380]   Is that a fair way to describe it?
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:20.220]   Yeah I mean they're approaching it more from an aggregation standpoint.
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.660]   So they're not worried about tech.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:28.620]   Well they're not worried about tech dirt at all but it's it's more in a you know Google
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.660]   Google news is the prototypical example.
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.740]   That's really really worried about the big tech.
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:33.740]   The big tech.
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:34.740]   Yeah well they want money.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:35.740]   All these links.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:40.260]   And yeah yeah and so when see when Google aggregates then they can put their advertising
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:44.060]   up and they can make money from the advertising as people aggregate on the other hand it's
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:49.180]   then sending people to these other publications where they may bounce off because there's pay
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:53.500]   walls so like you know it's your fault you're not making the money you're not figuring out
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:56.740]   how to monetize your audience very well and that doesn't mean that you should then go
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:57.740]   pick Google's pocket.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:01.660]   I just I understand I'm just trying to break this down a little bit for people like me
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.420]   who didn't really follow it.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.300]   I'm happy to do something.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:11.140]   Yeah yeah so so this this what what they're considering at this point is what are the rights
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:15.700]   of these publishers when it comes to link aggregators like Google is there else but
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:21.140]   else besides Google really well they're mad at Facebook because people share links on Facebook
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:27.300]   and so you get a lot of traffic from a Facebook link where you can potentially and Facebook
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:31.460]   is in theory also running some algorithms that are going to sort whether things percolate
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:36.340]   up so anyway Facebook makes money when links appear on its site and how dare Facebook make
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:38.900]   money for having a link to my publication.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:44.820]   So they're they're saying should we amend copyright law in such a way that the copyright extends
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.980]   to somebody who links to your content.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:53.140]   They're using the idea that they might have copyright in it so a lot of the study is also
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:58.380]   to examine doctrinally whether you even would have a copyright interest in the short bits
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:02.820]   that actually do get shared the title the link or maybe the snippets.
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:07.020]   Yeah the snippets it's an open question whether doctrinally you would potentially have a
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:12.820]   copyright but let's presume yes let's presume yes you could then the next question is and
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:17.700]   what do you get to do with that do you have an exclusive right to foreclose somebody from
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.180]   reusing that in some way.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:26.620]   What constitutes reuse this idea that you've scooped up links and aggregated that with
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:29.660]   and now you're presenting to you are on your page.
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:35.060]   Is this a major amendation of copyright laws is a big change?
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.620]   Would be.
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:43.300]   I mean yeah it's a barrier it's sort of you're supposed to have an interchange of ideas this
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:47.900]   is the point of it and this is putting up a toll booth on the exchange of ideas so we
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:52.060]   haven't seen that sort of toll booth before and part of it is because copyright developed
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:56.220]   in a world where we didn't have digital mediums so you had physical scarcity of products and
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.980]   you could attach the exclusive rights that go into a copyright to the existence of a
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:02.380]   physical product.
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:04.220]   Things do get weird when you start having.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:08.420]   Yeah this whole idea of links and snippets is brand new we've never had this.
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:13.780]   Well but but two things there are analogies here one is when copyright started news was
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.220]   not included not included at all.
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:20.180]   It was intended for books and longer things and so on news was not there second then the
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:25.380]   Associated Press tried to press what they called a hot news doctrine.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:30.060]   Same as the newspaper industry tried to press this with radio and say if I report something
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:35.580]   the essence of it is mine for some period of time and you can't replicate that.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:36.580]   I mean you certainly can't.
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:42.860]   So if Walter Winchill says if you watch your window says Lucille Ball is a communist and
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:48.980]   the New York Times publishes that the next day is that they would be they would be like
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:53.340]   a news doctrine they would have tried to argue that you can't do that.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:56.140]   That's our scoop and you can't publish it.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:59.980]   The newspaper industry had an agreement the built more agreement with the radio industry
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:06.140]   the very early days where the radio industry was not allowed to repeat any news item for
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:08.140]   I think it was 12 hours.
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.140]   Interesting.
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:12.020]   So this does impact I own the essence of this.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:15.620]   So whereas what copyright always protects is only the treatment of the information in
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:21.660]   a free society the information itself can never be owned but now they're trying to change
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:22.660]   it that way.
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:23.660]   Oh so that's interesting.
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:27.940]   So then the actual factual matter is not what's been copied.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:28.940]   Never been.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:32.460]   It's merely the way you've written it up and presented it.
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.460]   Right.
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:37.820]   But there's always tension and copyright where the idea expression dichotomy where actually
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:40.740]   I think this is merger where basically you can't separate the two.
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:44.180]   There's only like the fact is the fact and there's only so many ways of expressing the
[01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.180]   fact.
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:49.140]   The idea what Jeff was saying is like the nonfiction bits of our life are not supposed
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:50.820]   to be subject to copyright.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:55.020]   They're supposed to be an original work of authorship so it implies a certain degree
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:25:00.580]   of creativity how you write your nonfiction facts could qualify for copyright but not
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.580]   the facts themselves.
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:03.140]   Not the facts themselves ever.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.140]   Right.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:09.580]   So this is very doctrinally sort of a fraught area because then you get in the question of
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:15.180]   well copyright is we now we threw in copyright and copyright is making things complicated.
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:17.980]   What's the effects of making things complicated?
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:22.700]   The effects of making things complicated is we're having some issues exchanging of our
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.420]   ideas now because we don't know.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.420]   Is it copyrightable?
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.580]   Is it protectable to somebody on it to somebody not on it?
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:30.140]   How are we going to have a usable conversation?
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:37.580]   The irony and kind of the perverse irony of this push for the SANSALER a copyright is
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:41.820]   you know you get like some of the news organizations are talking about how we need an informed
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:46.420]   public and the informed public won't be an informed public if we don't have news businesses
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:50.580]   in the news business so you have to make sure the news business is supported but they're
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:56.340]   pushing for it to have a regulatory model that ultimately keeps the public away from
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:59.580]   the information that the news business is now producing.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:02.020]   So we're going to I mean.
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:05.060]   And that was what Spain realized essentially.
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.060]   They didn't realize it.
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.060]   They didn't realize it.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:12.820]   It was I believe the what happened was there was a local law that was really really atrocious.
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:18.340]   Google pulled out but then I think an EU law superseded it and the EU law was a little
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:22.140]   bit more gentle and so Google came back when the EU law ended up being the one that was
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:23.140]   operative.
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:26.460]   So I don't think I don't think Spain actually recanted.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.740]   It just sort of became less of an issue.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:29.980]   So it didn't hurt the publishers in Spain.
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:35.540]   The kind of the general principle that Google's making money off of our content and we want
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:38.220]   a little piece of it.
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:42.260]   You could argue both ways on that but the but the but your argument really is that it
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.660]   would be consequence.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:49.060]   It would be a bad thing for the general discourse and the general flow of information in society.
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:51.060]   I wouldn't concede the first point.
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:56.500]   I mean I would concede that like you know I and I've been thinking about it today like
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:01.860]   then the the plats the Internet platforms are being regarded as parasites in some way
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:05.860]   that they just suck from us but it's like no they're not parasites they're symbiotes.
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:07.900]   They are giving you what you need.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:12.220]   You need an audience or a news industry understand that it drives traffic.
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:14.220]   Why don't they understand that?
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:17.380]   They were adapted to that world.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:19.020]   They never adapted to that world.
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:23.260]   They only think of themselves as destinations that sell a product called content.
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.620]   Well and by the way.
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:25.620]   Make a new model.
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:32.660]   At a curiosity I think Google made a strong argument we drive traffic but our podcast
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:37.620]   or tech dirt probably can make a much weaker argument that we drive traffic.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:39.500]   We're just a parasite.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.900]   We're you're not a parasite.
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:46.140]   I mean you're like you know I sort of I may never use that again because the point I wanted
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:50.940]   to make is it's a symbiote and but that's not the way you're regular to the regular.
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:56.300]   But if I'm not driving traffic if I'm not driving traffic to the news stories that we're
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.740]   we're talking about I'm not really a symbiote.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:04.020]   The point of the news stories is just this which is conversation in the public domain
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:05.660]   in the public sphere.
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:06.660]   That is the point of it.
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:07.660]   No that's not the point of it.
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:11.420]   If you cut that off you're missing the point entirely the point of it is to drive traffic
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:15.340]   to our website so you see our ads.
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:21.100]   Well nothing's going to happen with this regulatory scheme because this regulatory scheme chills
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:22.100]   the environment.
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:27.300]   I mean presumably how do you get people to come to your website like what's you're out
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:31.900]   there and you need an audience facilitating service to help bring you that traffic and
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:34.060]   if all of a sudden that was audience facilitating service.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.660]   We didn't need it before Google.
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:38.900]   We're doing just fine before Google.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:42.180]   No no no no I mean we're in a shape you survived in the forest.
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:43.980]   You were in a tiny little shed then.
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:47.100]   No no I'm not talking about me I'm talking about newspaper.
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.500]   So a newspaper I understand they're upset.
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:56.340]   You know in the old days you didn't have Google to drive traffic to the newspaper.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:00.660]   You bought it for a nickel.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:06.100]   We're not in the old days so it's only somewhat helpful to analogize that way.
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:10.060]   But what's from their point of view what has happened is the world has changed and all
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:13.460]   of a sudden there's these people taking my time.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:18.500]   The postal service in the United States made it free free for newspapers to exchange newspapers
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.980]   with each other.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.500]   Copyright was not involved.
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:25.900]   There were editors called scissors editors that would cut things out of one of the old
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:26.900]   days.
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:29.260]   This has been Franklin times talking about now.
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:36.780]   It went and told the Associated Press and so that was done as a matter of policy of government
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:39.900]   policy to encourage the public discussion.
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:46.220]   But I would submit that I don't think the New York Times maybe in their loftiest ideals
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:51.980]   say we're facilitating public conversation but most sites we're facilitating our revenue
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:54.260]   by creating content that you will come to see.
[01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:57.980]   Yeah but if everybody called up said I'm not going to give you a quote unless you pay me
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:29:58.980]   for it.
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:29:59.980]   Yeah yeah.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:00.980]   Which is basically what's happening here.
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:01.980]   Ah that's good.
[01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.100]   David and Paul there's a good analogy.
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:05.100]   There's a good analogy.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.100]   Yeah.
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.860]   You're going to use my quote to make money in your newspaper.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.100]   What are you going to give me?
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:15.140]   Yeah that principle that this sense of entitlement of if you make money I should have a piece
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:21.740]   of it is a really poisonous one that taken to its logical extent is really bad and that's
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:25.860]   an example of it that would be bad for the news of like you can't get a quote well you're
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:29.540]   going to make money if that goes in your article and you have you know sell newspapers
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:31.500]   because of this one that you paid me to.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.100]   There's a tip for Ted.
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:38.740]   You know people are sources for a variety of reasons that benefit them.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:39.980]   Nobody just says well I'm going to do that.
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:44.660]   Many just hate being sources because they get misquoted and they get misunderstood and
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:45.660]   yeah.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:46.660]   Yeah but I mean.
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:51.260]   And I can speak to this better but the journalistic ethics of paying your source or probably a
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:52.260]   little fraud.
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:53.260]   Yes.
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:54.400]   Actually no it's changing.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:00.980]   What's changing for this reason is when it comes to diversity equity inclusion you know
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:10.500]   if you go to a professor and use their expertise and exploit that expertise and they get nothing
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:15.940]   for it you've exploited them for that purpose there is a school of thought that is now arguing
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:18.900]   that you should share at that level.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:24.380]   If you're if you go on CNN you get paid right or maybe not the individual person.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.380]   The contributors to.
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:26.380]   The contributors to.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:28.640]   I was never a contributor in the MSNBC but.
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:29.640]   Right.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.480]   So why did you go on and why did you give them the benefit of your expertise for you?
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   Huge ego.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.480]   There you go.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:40.480]   I mean one of the things is it distills the quid pro quote to something that is so dollars
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.680]   in sense in presume that there's nothing else that you can get from it.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:46.360]   And the idea we're talking about expression here.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:52.320]   So people have interest of being heard even if there was no economic upside people who
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:56.980]   are expressing themselves want to be heard and this is an obstacle to being heard then
[01:31:56.980 --> 01:32:02.060]   it turns out that normally being heard is a critical first step to be able to monetize
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:07.820]   the things that you actually said and this is also a barrier to that money actually existing.
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:13.940]   One of the problems that we have is that online monetization models are not quite ready for
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:15.860]   prime time at the moment.
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:20.300]   Online advertising is creepy invasive not particularly.
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:25.980]   They're a bit for purpose and so a lot of a lot of I think online periodicals are having
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:31.120]   some issues you know making actually monetizing their stuff but some can experiment with different
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.180]   sorts of monetization models and there's things to do and some of it is not that they're making
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:38.740]   no money like all the advertising dollars didn't completely dry up.
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:42.560]   They're just sort of like needing to get reallocated a little here and some of this isn't we're
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:47.240]   not making money but it's we're not making all the money and that's a completely different
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:52.720]   policy question and we're solving for they're not making all the money and calling it oh
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:56.200]   but they're not making any money at all and I think you know just the economics of what
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:00.000]   problem we're trying to solve are not being well investigated and I don't think are part
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.920]   of the study at the moment and that's key what are we're presuming that there's really
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.920]   an economic failure here and we're not even understanding if that's true and if to the
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:12.800]   extent it's true what is failing how and what would be a much better way of fixing it if
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.560]   we actually have a problem to fix.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.560]   Kathy I'm so glad you're here.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:20.760]   He's been trying to get somebody to agree with him for so long.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.960]   Bless this heart.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.760]   Just teasing.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:30.320]   Obviously obviously this is something we care about but I'm glad you could explain it a
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.320]   little bit more for.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.320]   Yeah, brilliantly.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:37.040]   Explain it like I'm a fifth grader is basically my motto.
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.040]   Let's take a little break.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.960]   It's great to have Kathy Gellis here.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:42.600]   You know there's no insult in that but.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:47.280]   Oh no I'm not I hope not.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.240]   We also have Jeff Jarvis.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:54.320]   The problem is Jeff's a professor so what happens sometimes is it becomes a colloquy
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:00.160]   you know worthy of a graduate school of journalism and poor Ant and I are going I don't know
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.720]   what they're talking you know what they're talking about I don't know what they're talking
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.720]   about.
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:04.720]   It's something like this.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.320]   Well as long as you don't feel like we're ganging up on you.
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.320]   No no no no no no.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.640]   No not at all.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.800]   I mean I let it run but my broadcaster instinct is going.
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.800]   Yeah I know.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.000]   I can better explain this better explain this.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.880]   I'm so excited about this.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:26.240]   And I don't know I don't want to patronize our smart audience either because I think they
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:31.160]   probably but it's complicated and I want to make sure the thing that I think launched
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:35.680]   it which was the two words ancillary copyright I don't think people understood exactly.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.680]   If you adjust said Lister Schutzrecht.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:40.120]   Yeah that really clarified it a lot.
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.120]   You tried.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:45.280]   Don't get lost in the technical term because I can't quite explain where that came on but
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:51.200]   it's essentially we had copyright for a long time and this is sort of a bolt on that is
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.040]   it changing what we always had in a way that I don't think we're completely anticipating
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:56.040]   the consequences.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:59.160]   And it's something we talk about all the time which is the tension between the new
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:04.640]   and the old and and you know I mean we talk all the time about journalism and how to serve
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:10.560]   how to save journalism and you know whether this is necessary and yet at the same time
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.240]   obviously it's a technology network so we kind of are on the side of technology most
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:21.520]   of the time except except but it's me versus Jeff then I'm the Luddite.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:28.080]   And and Pruitt is also here hands on photography our show today take a little break and come
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:34.400]   back with a lot more our show today brought to you by cash fly actually when I say brought
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.040]   to you by cash fly it's kind of literally brought to you by cash fly cash is our CD
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.160]   and our content delivery network.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:45.640]   We've been with them for more than a decade they solved a big problem how do we get you
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:52.320]   the podcasts in a timely fast fashion people were downloading it from our website and there
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.000]   were bottlenecks it was slow we have listeners all over the world we really wanted to be

[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:12.680]   twit.cash fly.com let's let's stay in court for a moment as we've got a council here
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:18.000]   tharino's trial is over Elizabeth Holmes you know what's interesting though and I don't
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:24.000]   know maybe I'm reading more into this they found her guilty of defrauding investors but
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:32.720]   found her innocent of defrauding normal people with bogus test results that seems unwrong
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:40.560]   to me I mean yeah so maybe Mark Andreessen lost a bunch of money by the way this market
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:47.840]   erased this tweet but thanks to coach for bringing it back this is from this is from some time
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:55.600]   ago I think it was 10 years ago Mark said the ongoing veneration of scientific peer review
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:04.640]   is really questionable in a promotional promotional tweet for his investment just didn't go so
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:12.280]   well now of course she'll be facing some possibly I don't know what but the sense will be but
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:17.400]   it could be as much as 10 I think 20 years per count so thought I saw up to 20 yeah it
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:24.120]   could be it could be bad.
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:30.600]   Should we celebrate this is this the right answer I think it is yeah found guilty of
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:37.000]   four of 11 charges I'm not celebrating it until she's in there for more than two years
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.280]   you know this this is kind of stuff that I'm used to seeing where the rich continue to
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:47.480]   get richer or the rich continue to find a way to weasel out of their punishment so yeah
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:54.360]   she's probably going if she goes to jail to country club jail anyway right exactly you
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:41:02.680]   know like that's that's not punishment man come on but I any jail any loss of liberty
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:07.800]   is is a significant deprivation we shouldn't be too glib about.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:15.440]   Sorry. Yeah you want to tackle Leo's question I've heard an explanation but you're a council.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:22.640]   Why did the jury go for the charges? You know the investors got screwed over but not the
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:28.040]   users. I don't I don't know the answer to the question it's not exactly my type of law
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:33.520]   and I didn't follow the trial closely but basically one of the things that might inform
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.880]   it is every charge has elements and different things that you'd have to prove and it may
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.600]   just be that could be some of the counts that she was charged on were easier to prove up
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:47.520]   than other ones or which could be I don't know if that is the explanation I have seen
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:51.800]   something on Twitter that suggested that might be what happened and that that I heard was
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:57.320]   intent matter that it was easier to prove in this case that she was trying to defraud
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:06.160]   the investors it was hard to say that she was for whatever the evidence there was explicitly
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.920]   trying to defraud the users of the technology. That could well be if for many criminal charges
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:16.680]   intent is a really important factor that needs to be proven up and it may have been
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:23.080]   easier and for some of these counts than others. Yeah three counts of wire fraud against specific
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:31.160]   investors one kind of conspiracy to commit wire fraud the other charges dropped or not
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:38.840]   guilty. Do you think she entered this attempt with the fraudulent tent or did it go bad
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:45.520]   after a while? Who knows I guess we don't know. I think the more interesting question
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:52.000]   was there's a Twitter fight happening surrounding a tweet by Benedict Evans where I think he
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:59.600]   was taking the other way. Somebody had tweeted that basically oh this is Silicon Valley ethos
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:05.200]   and like it finally got like caught. He's like no that wasn't this isn't Silicon Valley
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:09.280]   ethos you know this is more particular and I think there's an open question of whether
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:13.480]   you know to what extent because we talked about this earlier with like innovators and
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:18.720]   followers that at a certain point I think there's just such a gold rush mentality towards
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:24.800]   well this thing worked so you know let's all have one and if that happens you get a lot
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:29.920]   of snake oil sales that keep getting offered and you know was this a snake oil sale that
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:36.160]   went bad was it bad in any particular way or you know is this kind of what tends to happen
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.400]   and only this person got caught and I don't know the answers to that question but I do
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:44.280]   know there's a lot of snake oil and you know people probably lose money chasing it.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:49.040]   Yeah Evans was responding to a tweet by Faiz Siddiqui who tweeted the Elizabeth Holmes
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:54.360]   case was perhaps the highest profile test of whether the Silicon Valley ethos taken to
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:58.840]   the extreme could withstand legal scrutiny. Now she makes history as the first Silicon
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:04.280]   Valley CEO to be convicted of a white collar crime to which Evans responds I can't be bothered
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:09.880]   to go into this again but no telling lies is not the Silicon Valley ethos tolerance for
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:16.040]   failure yes bootstrapping yes unrealistic ambition yes lying no this is like climbing
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:20.240]   the Jason Blair was in indictment of the journalism ethos. Okay that's fair enough.
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:26.280]   I think I think as usual Ben's right like Kathy she's usually right and Ben's usually
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:31.840]   right but I think that there's a desire to say that this exhibits something about all
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:38.280]   of Silicon Valley and all the technology. It's Enron it's a fraudulent company whether
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:43.520]   however it got there it ends up being a fraudulent country or layman brothers or whatever that
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:51.280]   went overboard and it's not tied to technology it's an eternal story.
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:55.440]   Actually I love the mistake. I love his subsequent tweet that he says the interesting Silicon
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:01.120]   Valley angle on Theranos is that founders did not really participate in the Silicon
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:07.560]   Valley system but sold quote Silicon Valley disruption to East Coast investors who didn't
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:16.400]   know anything about tech or bio. Henry Kissinger was on George Schultz yeah general mad dog
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:22.600]   madis yeah it was all Easterners not Silicon Valley types yeah which is sort of interesting
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:29.400]   because they in theory should be sophisticated investors and yet they were defrauded it's
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:34.960]   kind of an interesting well that's why they were perfect because they could be fooled but
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:42.200]   they had credibility. It's just exactly what you want although Mick Sarah J. Vich also
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:48.080]   points out Tim Draper, Donald Lucas, Dixon Doll, all invested in Theranos including Larry
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:53.400]   Ellison so there was Silicon Valley money. There was Theranos money as well so it's
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:46:00.320]   fascinating actually. Anyway it's a great story if you haven't read the book absolutely
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:06.240]   must read and I think it's I think the story well it's not quite over because Sonny gets
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:13.000]   tried next. Although his strategy might change because I was apparently home strategy or
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.560]   home's attorney strategy to blame Sonny for it. Actually maybe it'll work even better
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:26.640]   now Sonny can blame her say see I told you it wasn't my idea. I guess we can do a little
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:34.000]   inside baseball. Ben Smith the esteemed media columnist at the New York Times leaves the
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:40.840]   New York Times to join is it Justin Smith? Justin Smith. Yep. Who is a no relation.
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:48.480]   No no has a Ray Tract records. Yeah. Ellie Smith and Jones. Great track record TV reference
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:54.320]   for you. Yeah boy there's a there's an old one. Don't don't worry about it. Yeah no don't
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:47:03.560]   go. I got nothing. Yeah. So tell us about Jeff's. Justice. Justice. Justice. Justin I
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:10.600]   know and respect greatly. Justin was the the guy who brought the week magazine to the
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:16.080]   US for Felix Dennis and did a brilliant and very unusual launch of the magazine. No news
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.840]   stands for example. He made it work and he gave it a brand and it's really quite amazing
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:25.600]   and he went to the Atlantic where he brought it back from death. It was at the door knocking
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:29.120]   on Hell's door and he brought it back and made it into the tremendous brand that it
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:33.160]   is and also started courts with some help with the COVID by the way. I think COVID helps
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:37.640]   Atlantic a lot. Well that too. I think Atlantic's but I actually think the Atlantic's does
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:41.720]   too many takes now but that's not a story. And then Justin went to Bloomberg for the last
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:45.880]   I think eight years where he sat directly across from Michael Bloomberg. I went to visit
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:51.600]   Justin more than once and and in the open space directly across from him and his job was to
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:55.040]   take the free parts of Bloomberg. Bloomberg you know is he really expensive terminal.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:00.040]   That's what Bloomberg loves the person but to take business week which they bought and
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:05.040]   the web and all this stuff and turn into a business and and he did he turned into a major
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:11.520]   source of revenue. So now he and Ben Smith are going to start something new and and before
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.200]   we were on the air. Leo and I were comparing notes about a New Yorker interview with Ben
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:22.120]   Smith and which like his finks he said absolutely nothing to value. It was actually quite enjoyable
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:28.360]   Clare Malone writing in the Yorker. Ben Smith can't say what his new media venture is. She
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:34.600]   she leads by saying Ben Smith had 144 unread text messages when we talked for a sometimes
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:40.120]   digitally distracted 16 minutes just at just afternoon yesterday 15 minutes after we hung
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:46.440]   up he responded to an email I'd sent asking if he'd like to talk. Obviously very busy
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:52.200]   very I'm busy I'm very busy and it was a it's great publicity but he did not say what
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.320]   he wants to do except all they're saying is that they see a market in the 200 million
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:01.160]   college educated English speaking people around the world and believe there's an opportunity
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:05.320]   there. What the hell that means I have no idea. It means they're going after the New York
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:10.560]   Times is what it means. Well all the way to it with elbows. Yeah. And they do it without
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:19.400]   ancillary copyright. Oh my god no. Wow. This is what we call a callback. Wait on now I'll
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:26.920]   bring up Scott Bakula. Yeah. We'll find a way. He made a quantum leap into a new form of
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:32.640]   journalism. Anyway that's it's probably pretty inside baseball but the but people who follow
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:37.600]   all of this are very interested to know and it is in a way it's interesting to see a couple
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:42.600]   of people have done very well for themselves decide to launch into journalism. Well there
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:47.920]   is an online angle here too which is the Ben has been Ben oh I respect Ben has gone after
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:54.320]   me but never mind. He's very very smart. He did great things with Buzzfeed news. He left
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:59.560]   Buzzfeed before Buzzfeed went to its back and thus became public. He had tons of options
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.960]   and had vowed to get rid of those options because it was a conflict of interest. He was the
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:09.560]   media critic at the New York Times. Well I had many pointed out today that he managed
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:16.120]   to leave without having to do that because the Buzzfeed spec went and God knows what
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:23.560]   his strike price was on those options. One presumes he gets to keep the options down.
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:31.080]   Good news the I think in the 9th District Court has ruled that the FCC actually has some engineering
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:38.240]   expertise and you in fact when the FCC says you know what we are not going to give the
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:43.680]   telcos the six gigahertz spectrum but we're going to open it up for unlicensed use just
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:50.400]   as we did the Wi-Fi spectrum years and years ago the DC Court said yeah you know what they
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:56.880]   can do that. So that's good. We're moving ahead and this actually impacts Wi-Fi 6E which
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:02.800]   does use the six gigahertz band but also opens up the band for a lot more interesting
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:11.840]   uses. Wi-Fi has been kind of an incredible success story for unlicensed unregulated spectrum.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:18.600]   AT&T was really pissed. That must be a good decision.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:24.280]   Actually I've been also enjoying the back and forth between AT&T Verizon and the Federal
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:29.560]   Aviation Administration and the FCC. I can't tell who's in the right and wrong in this
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:36.760]   one. Well it's another one where the FCC's engineers said no 5G go ahead do it. The telcos
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:41.800]   bought the spectrum and then the FAA says well wait a minute that's going to screw up our
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:52.360]   altimeters. It's going to make it aviation dangerous stop. Then the telcos said no.
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:58.720]   And then they said yes but we're not happy about it. We'll give you a couple of weeks.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:02.920]   Although I like the way they said no they said it's not our responsibility to make up
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:11.760]   for the antiquated altimeters used by some manufacturers. They should get better altimeters.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:16.400]   But I don't want a plane to come out of the sky either. So I think again this is a good
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:27.040]   case of where you know the FCC for a few years was perhaps not the best scientific arbiter
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:33.200]   or cultural steward of our infrastructure. But I think you can say you know I think the
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:37.280]   circuit court was correct when saying you know somebody's got to be in charge of this
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:43.760]   stuff. They got a lot of engineers. Jessica Rosen-Warsle the new chairman of the FCC chairperson
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:50.280]   applauded the decision. The decision she said or she tweeted equals more Wi-Fi and more
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:53.800]   places and it matters because it comes at a time when being connected is more important
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:53:01.160]   than ever and I would agree. Let's see yesterday the Blackberry end of an era. Anybody still
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:09.800]   using a Blackberry? Not working. Does Roger still exist up there in Canada? Yeah. Blackberry
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:15.880]   pivoted a while ago. They no longer make phones. They now make us operate. They bought
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:21.760]   Q and X and make operating systems for cars. But am I misremembering or is this decline
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:27.760]   of Blackberry tied to a really devastating patent decision? Oh. I misremembering that.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:33.320]   That's interesting. I think most people trace it to the rise of the smartphone particularly
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:38.240]   the iPhone. Blackberry didn't really see that as a threat and of course it completely put
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:45.160]   them out of business. If I'm not mis… Now I'm really curious. I know there was something
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:50.120]   and if that thing was as catastrophic against Blackberry as I seem to remember it being,
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:53.160]   that is an interesting thing that we shouldn't overlook when we think about the history of
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:59.880]   what happened to this technology. Although now I'm just throwing random rumors out because
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:05.920]   I could be misremembering. Here from 2006 is an article. That's what people tune in
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:12.440]   for. Random speculation. That's us. Random speculation. I do have a story though from
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:18.480]   IEEE Spectrum in 2006. The story behind the Blackberry case, a single filing with the
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:23.840]   US Patent and Trademark Office in 1991, has caused one of the largest patent disputes
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:28.960]   in recent memory threatening to sever more than 3 million Blackberry subscribers from
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:33.920]   their wireless email service. If I didn't have to click yes on this cookie announcement,
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:44.920]   I would be able to read this article. We wonder why the publishers are having issues. Design
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.520]   your website so that they're readable and people can actually consume your content and
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:54.960]   then start complaining if you're still having issues. The DOJ got involved. They warned
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:55:00.280]   that disabling Blackberry service would harm the public. At this time, every member of
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:03.960]   Congress, I remember I interviewed the chairman of the FCC, Michael Powell at the time, he
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:12.080]   had a Blackberry. Everybody relied on Blackberries. I remember we used to manage to bez, Blackberry
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:16.280]   and a parts server. Yeah, I love that. That's what went down. By the way, that's what went
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:22.040]   by by yesterday was all the Blackberry back end stuff. Again, this is behind a paywall,
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:29.400]   so I have no idea how this case ended. I'm assuming that's what you remember. I think
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:38.880]   you owe the money now for even having mentioned it. Honestly, if I say IEEE Spectrum, that's
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:44.440]   a little plug for them. No, no, no, no. You've stolen their—it's like taking a picture
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:49.640]   in the jungle. You've stolen their soul. For more information, subscribe to the IEEE
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.080]   Spectrum and let me know what it says behind the paywall. Well, now you're giving them
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:58.680]   free publicity. They're not paying you for the ads. I try to always mention not only
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:05.920]   the journal, but also the author to give the author credit to. I always try to do that.
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:11.600]   Sometimes I forget. I would assist him with compulsory licenses guiding your behavior
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:17.080]   on this. Right. Whatever that means, like Shenzhen Shrecht.
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:22.240]   Exactly. There's this guy named Jeff Jarvis. I hope he doesn't mind me invoking his name.
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:25.280]   I put this in. I think I want to put it in here because he says—
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:31.840]   But you'd like to make fun of me. He thinks this emoji is a whistling emoji. Well, everybody
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:40.040]   knows it's a kissing emoji. Only yesterday. Y-Y-L. I learned I've been using this again
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:45.120]   and again and again for whistling incredibly and appropriately as it turns out. Oh, wow.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:51.960]   Yes. You've been sending people kisses. Well, I've been—the next tweet there, I
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:56.480]   searched and I said, "Oh, my God. What have I done?" And it makes no sense. So I think
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:03.280]   I'm whistling marking irony instead of kissing. Now, by the way, in defense of myself, one
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:08.520]   does pucker up and blow. That's how you whistle. Yeah. Well, sure.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:11.600]   How can people can whistle through their teeth? So they don't have to come through.
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:18.920]   Future reference. I refer you to emoji pedia where you can not only find the emoji, but
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:26.600]   you can find the unicode consortiums. It's the bad emoji. The unicode consortiums description.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:34.000]   The text is a text description of the emojis. So— It's like I need clippy to explain the
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.680]   emojis to me. You look like you're trying to offend somebody.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:46.080]   Let me find somebody called Micah Sargent. Here it is. It says kissing face. No, it's
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:52.560]   whistling. And right next to it, by the way, is the other one which is face blowing a kiss
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:58.920]   and it has a little heart on it. So I think you—in the court of public opinion, you have
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:09.480]   failed. I could fast—I screwed up. It's like the grandma who kept tweeting "FML" to
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:15.680]   her daughter who said, "What? Do you know what "FML" means?" And it was something like,
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:23.720]   "Find my life jacket." I don't know. That's not how exactly the story, but it was close
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:31.880]   enough to get the gist. LOL. Lots of love. But it really was loud. But that's not dirty.
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:37.920]   You got to have some— That was a case with a Merlach executive and a prime minister of
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:44.800]   England where their text became public and LOL was used and he thought it was lots of
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:52.520]   love. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This just in a direct reference to the emoji PgA kissing
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:59:00.000]   face with smiling eyes sometimes taken to represent whistling, especially when paired
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:07.120]   with a musical note. You needed to pair it with a musical note, sir.
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:13.360]   And then everyone was known with a user manual that is not a good emoji. I repeat.
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:20.160]   It may convey such feelings as surprise, admiration, contempt, or feigned innocence as a person
[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:26.280]   with hands and pockets casually whistling after wrongdoing as if saying nothing to look
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:31.600]   at here. I think I've also with Jeff. This isn't not only is it not an effectively universal
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.760]   way of communicating an idea, but it wouldn't also be how I'd illustrate somebody and
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:42.480]   an emoji pulling a kiss. As Sigmund Freud once said, sometimes an eggplant is just an eggplant.
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:50.760]   Well, that's not an emoji. I believe he said that. Oh, it is. Obviously you don't
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:59.480]   get any text messages from gentlemen callers, so we won't go into that. Let's play the
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:05.000]   drums. My ignorance really is bliss. You're not missing anything, Kathy, trust me. Let's
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:11.080]   play the music and do our Google change law. Kathy, you can ignore this. This is just something
[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:17.560]   we do. I don't know why we do it. We do it. We keep on talking about other things. It's
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:21.200]   supposed to be about Google. So here's the part of the show, which is actually about
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:29.440]   Google nine to five Google reports. Google is just like everybody else working on AR
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:35.120]   smart glasses with a new project. So that's really not a change log story, but just, you
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:40.920]   know, it's appropriate because you got rid of it that way. Yeah. You get it all the record.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:46.960]   And this one's for you, Jeff Jarvis. Google is subject to new tougher supervision by German
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:53.800]   regulators like they weren't on their ass already. They have now officially invoked the
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:01:04.640]   five years surveillance period. We will be watching the nation's federal cartel office,
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:08.280]   which probably has a great German name, which I don't know. The watchdog can now step in
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:13.680]   earlier and ban practices at deemed anti competitive. Google's quote paramount significance
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:18.520]   for competition across markets and the fact that its economic cloud is insufficiently
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:25.040]   controlled by competition prompted the ruling. It's not very much fun. It's the Bundesliga
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:26.040]   hotel opt.
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:32.880]   Bundesliga tell up says we have already started to look into Google's processing of personal
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:39.200]   data and to deal with the Google news showcase issue. There you go right there. The Google
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:46.760]   news showcase issue is in more detail. So watch out Google. What is it? Kathy, you may
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:47.960]   be getting a few trips to Germany.
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:54.400]   Come on up. I actually did a semester of law school in Germany. So that I'm. Do you speak
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:02:00.880]   German? I got to a point where I could function and I won an argument with Deutsche Bank, but
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:07.360]   I can't. It didn't stick. But yeah. But that's good. We should add that to our lower third
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:10.960]   one and argument in Deutsche. Deutsche Bank.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:19.080]   Google has purchased a company called, I don't know how you say it, C amplify. Sure. For
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:31.200]   cloud security. All the good names are taken apparently. See S I E M P L I F Y. 500 million
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:38.200]   smackers half a billion dollars. So I should probably know what see amplify does. Something
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:46.200]   with security. Oh, I'm not in the change log section. You're not even an official. Thank
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:56.760]   you for that editorial advice. And now the Google it was all Google. Now the Google change
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:07.680]   log where OS. Now even longer than before where us will soon be able to unlock Chromebooks
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:14.280]   and Android phones and tablets from your watch. Actually, that's a feature Apple has
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:19.760]   on its iPhone. And in this day and age of masking, it's much needed. I really appreciate
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:25.480]   it. Android. There it is. There's an Android watch. You probably have never seen one before,
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:34.840]   but that's it. Android Automotive is getting a YouTube app and more control over cars.
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.400]   Crow I'm just going to run right through these. Crow if you if you want me to stop if you've
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:43.920]   got any interest in any of these stories, stop me. Chromecast built in coming to Bose
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:52.880]   as Google works on a headphone auto switching and spatial audio. That's OK. Fast pairing.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:57.280]   We actually talked about this on Windows weekly. This is something a Windows user is excited
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:02.280]   about. It's kind of like I think Bluetooth Ellie fast pairing coming to Google TV, Android
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:11.360]   TV and all matter compatible smart home products. So you know when you open your AirPods and
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:17.480]   the iPhone says, Oh, you want me to pair with those? It's like that. It's fast. They're
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:23.880]   also bringing nearby share and fast pair to Windows PCs. Chrome OS is getting a quick
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:31.040]   setup via Android ability to reply to phone chat apps. And this is also for fast pairing.
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:34.800]   That'll be. Oh, that's actually that's an important one. You should show that one. The
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:41.560]   end of big one. Pixel six pause. We actually, I think we we scooped this one. Not based
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:47.760]   on any info from Google, but it was no, we didn't we wouldn't do any reporting on this,
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:53.440]   but I read it. I saw it on Reddit. Is that count? Yeah, that counts. You've aggregated
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:59.800]   a link. How dare you in the link? It's all you all the way. All the ancillary copyright
[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:06.280]   all the way down. The Google Pixel update, which was supposed to come out in December,
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:12.120]   didn't I hypothesize that it was because the people who did get it early had all sorts of
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:16.920]   connectivity issues. Google now confirms that they say the December update, which has a
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:22.840]   lot of new features. It's a feature drop plus security update plus bug fix is going to come
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:28.240]   out in the next couple of weeks. So it'll fix a whole bunch of stuff. I got the new Pixel
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:34.680]   stand and and the you know, the Pixel stand stuff doesn't work yet either. So wow, come
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:40.120]   on man. So that's coming and they confirmed our suspicion that it was really because of
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:46.440]   connectivity issues. Google photos has seemingly, according to nine to five Google remove the
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:53.680]   option to separate video backup over cellular from photo. I don't know what that means.
[02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:59.680]   Whatever that means. Google D lists faulty December 20. We already said that Android 12
[02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:05.280]   January security patch has come out though for some people at least on the three a four,
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:10.360]   four a four a five G five and five a again, you poor Pixel six people you just going to
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:16.480]   have to wait. But the security update will come with everything else all at once. But
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:20.720]   everybody else with older Pixel phones is getting that security update. Yeah, we're
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:26.800]   on Jeff you and I and and Ant two were all Pixel six pro users were on the November security
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:35.200]   update. Yeah, yep. Cassie, what are you hearing patiently? Are you pack? It's a to pixel,
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:41.640]   but not that one. Oh, okay. Well, I knew you like it. I knew you're quite all right.
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:47.440]   It's not like a person. I'm not an icon. Yeah. And all right. Apparently the sixes will
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:55.600]   get the update in the next couple of weeks. And that's the Google change a lot. That
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:01.840]   was nice. That was fast. That was good. I like that. I'm loving you did leave out something
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:08.040]   though regarding the the AR developments with Google. What tell me like they're working
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:15.920]   on this AR development for now because you know, they just until they stop. Yeah. Let's
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:22.480]   see it. Do they hire all the Facebook engineers? Oh, yeah, there's 300 people looking for looking
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:28.480]   for somewhere to go. Jeff's you should save this for your product of the week. The new
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:34.320]   Lego Gutenberg printing press is an appeal. I want everyone to go vote for this. Oh, this
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:42.200]   is an idea. This is an idea. I like this. Now has 2,525 supporters. Everyone on if you
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:48.320]   love me, if you love me Twiggers, go and vote for the Gutenberg Lego press because you know
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:53.720]   it'll make me happy. Wow. They already have a thousand supporters. Let me just can I just
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:08:01.320]   do I have to sign in or just a sign in? That's compelling. But what's the what's the competition?
[02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:05.640]   Probably a teradactyl or something. I don't know. I mean, it might be like that's really
[02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:09.520]   great, Jeff, but the other thing, you know, yeah, it's your fault. Hey, let's pause.
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:16.160]   I like you. I'm just hypothesizing. I'm just so I'm just you are a lawyer after all.
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:22.360]   Jeff, when you were a TV critic, did you review quantum leap? I can't remember. I think I
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:27.000]   might have what year was that? Let's go to the TV guides. Oh, late 80s. I'm gonna just
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:35.840]   log into my Lego account while we're rebuilding. You have a Lego account. Oh, sorry, Jeff.
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:43.320]   No time. This is like Jimmy Kimmel not bringing on Matt Damon. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. We've
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:54.120]   run out of time, Matt. I should start doing that. I don't know. What do you pick some
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:58.720]   of these? I think I thought I thought the aunt might enjoy Occam's leaf. I put that
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:05.560]   in there for him. Occam's leaf, the mystery of an iPhone. So this is an interesting story.
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:12.320]   And I'm in its kind of maybe maybe not as good as we thought it was. Mitch Cohen tweeted,
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:18.880]   I snapped a photo of a group of people outside today. And my iPhone with its, you know, computational
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:24.160]   photography replaced one woman's head with a leaf. And it does look like that because
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:28.120]   you could see the outline of her head. You can even see some hair here. But then there's
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:36.120]   all these leaves all her fate all her flesh tone. Face is a leaf. A brown. Kind of stands
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:42.160]   to reason with computational photography. The iPhone is using all three lenses to compose
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:47.040]   that picture. And you know, it might have just made a mistake. In milliseconds. Yeah,
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:54.160]   with in the little seconds, even hitting the shutter. So he reported this on Twitter. And
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:10:01.560]   then got a bunch of people looking at it. And here's a crop so you can see the photo.
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:07.400]   It does look like the iPhone is put a leaf in its own face. But I think it's the it's
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:13.680]   the Rorschach filter. Maybe. Do you see what you look at it? Yes. Do you see a leaf?
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:20.640]   I see a puppy. He submitted it to Sebastian DeWitt who created the halide app, who's really
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:27.000]   a camera. He probably knows more about how the iOS cameras work. And he said, so Sebastian
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:34.280]   has said, could you sentence his original image to me and any images before and after? And
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:40.400]   this this is the subsequent tweet on New Year's Eve, which gave us all something to do instead
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:47.680]   of Anderson Cooper. Big news. I said, by the way, Andy Cohen, his cohost on that is now
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:53.960]   apologizing for his. Yeah, his drunken out there. He was over served bring back caffeine.
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:11:00.120]   The legacy was over served. Did you watch it? Did you watch it? At one point, Andy Cohen
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:05.880]   saying, look at me. The blazio dancing. He shouldn't be dancing. Hey, we're on this city.
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:10.240]   Get off of my stage. It was wild. Did you watch it? Jeff as a New Yorker? I think you
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:18.600]   did live live. Yeah. Pretty wild. Anyway, back to the other Cohen, Mitch Cohen, he says,
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:25.880]   Big news I sent at SDW, the original image. He theorized a leaf from a foreground tree,
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:30.400]   obscured the face. I didn't think anything was in view in the closest tree is a Japanese
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:37.600]   maple, but he's right. So he shot another video that he thinks I'm still suspicious,
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:43.160]   but he says this video shows that there's the leaf right there in the persp getting the
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:48.680]   way the perspective and then maybe the leaf was actually in the shot in the iPhone didn't
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:56.240]   screw up. So really it's a ridiculous. This is your first conversation. I still screwed
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:01.800]   up. Well, this is your first conversation about like all the consumer technology and
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:07.160]   can it be better in theory? This is better. It caught more detail and yet it's something
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:12.320]   at the same time. That's a good point. It did what I was supposed to do really, really
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:21.840]   well, not what you wanted though. Exactly. Yeah. So Leo. Yeah. I think I found two, two
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:28.880]   count them to spectacular tick talks this week. Oh, my gosh. So I have to apologize in advance
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:36.480]   to Kathy that somehow we've got this new thing where we play tick talks. I'm telling you,
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:39.760]   you're going to thank me. You're going to take talk to the TV of T. B. You've taught
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:48.600]   her mom's report of tea. Her son's temperate and watching through tick tock T. E. A. Okay.
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:53.400]   Let's let's watch and describe it for your audience on audio. So let's let's let's put
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:57.320]   the audio on so we can we can also hear you. Well, that's the wrong one. That's the wrong
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:01.560]   one. Okay. Is it this one? I guess we're not going to do tick tock is it this one? Well,
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:08.200]   I just clicked your link. Oh, hell, it didn't work. Okay. But try the TV. You put you put
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:13.160]   this screwed up. I did. I screwed up. Go to the next one. Well, that's now you now I want
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:18.360]   to know. Don't do those. No, don't do this. Okay. Well, the boot one is okay. But don't
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:24.800]   do that one. Tick the next TV reporter moms. By the way, part of the reason you script
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:31.200]   is because you're watching tick tock on Twitter. That is definitely ancillary copyright violation
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:40.320]   right. Definitely not helping this salt. Do not be watching the tick tock on Twitter.
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:45.560]   So this this is I did see this one actually. She's a good it's kind of sad. She was a TV
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:51.600]   news reporter who quit her job to become a mother. And apparently the job can't quit
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:56.920]   her. Kayla Sullivan reporting line from outside my son's bedroom where he's currently being
[02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:03.320]   detained until nap time is over. Now this story does involve a minor. So I can't release specifics.
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:08.240]   But what I can confirm is my son is a two year old terrorist who held me hostage at the
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:12.800]   Olive Garden earlier today. It's important to know if the friends I met there do not
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:20.280]   have children and likely never will after witnessing this situation. But authorities
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:25.400]   believe the proper precautions were taken. I brought my son's favorite snacks and even
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:30.400]   risk judgment from other moms by bringing an iPad. But not even Pokemon could have stopped
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:34.400]   this meltdown after several cries demanding quote.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:36.360]   Chacha. Chacha. A good.
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:37.000]   Some.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:43.200]   Miraculously understood it as the English word catch up and brought him a bomb. Unfortunately
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:47.800]   he was later punished after he threw a catch up covered fork at her.
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:53.440]   Not all those were case. But this one should have worn an apron. You know these toddler
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:59.400]   outbursts are becoming increasingly common as more and more parents try out the new craze
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.400]   gentle parenting and completely suck at it.
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:10.040]   I love it. You could take that. You could take the woman out of the newsroom but you
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:12.760]   can't take. But it's also a great mockery of all television.
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:16.280]   Oh totally. And she's got the voice. She's got it down. She's.
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:20.600]   That was so much better than what I thought it was going to be because this just had flashbacks
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:26.800]   to when Rudy Giuliani was mayor and he was married to the anchor woman Donna Hanover and
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:31.320]   his son like made faces and behave really poorly at a press conference and I thought
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:33.760]   it was going to be that.
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:37.440]   I'm actually I've experienced that myself. I.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:38.440]   Leo.
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:39.440]   What?
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:40.440]   Leo.
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:44.640]   Scroll down one on the on the TikTok. I think I think you did that on purpose. No I clicked
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:45.640]   the watch watch.
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:50.200]   That's rolled down one clicking the link. The link brings me here.
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:53.120]   Now let's go down one more here. Is it there?
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:57.840]   There it is. All right ladies and gentlemen without further ado I give you.
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:02.880]   TikTok tea. She's got a tea bags. The tea is in the tea bag. The tea looks like tea
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:08.560]   bag looks like a shirt. She spills the tea. She's going through all of the tea bags now
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:17.480]   sewing them into a mask. Don't play the music. I should take the music off. That's a ancillary
[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:23.720]   copyright violation right there and she has made herself a TikTok tea bag shirt.
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:30.840]   That gets in the hot tub and soaks. Oh my gosh.
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:32.720]   It's your tea. Was that worth it?
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:37.240]   Yeah but no. Now we're going to get taken down so no.
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:41.560]   That's your fault. You had the sound though. The mom reporter was much better than that
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:45.920]   one. Oh I thought. No no it's not it's the background music.
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:49.640]   I think that whoever owns that music is going to be unhappy.
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:55.440]   No I think we're saying that the quality of that well no that was good but the the the
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:59.200]   mom you don't have to suck up. You don't have to suck up to Jeff. It's okay.
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:02.400]   No. Everybody kicks me here. That's what they do.
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:10.280]   So well you know Dionne Warwick. Oh man. Dionne Warwick. I love her. She's older these days
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:20.760]   and a little bit salty. Apparently got into a Twitter battle with Oreo cookies.
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:27.200]   So she tweeted Oreo hello which by the way you don't have to do that on Twitter. I just
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:32.880]   want to tell our older viewers. What is your weirdest flavor? What are y'all doing the
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:42.520]   most? The one flavor was fine. I think if you click on that she was she was commenting
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:47.080]   on a specific flavor. Yeah now now.
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:53.400]   Wait a minute. I just messing up all the time the day. I'm just gonna I'm messing up today.
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:58.760]   Twitter is not now by the way she's changed. I love this her Twitter profile picture to
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:08.480]   be her holding a stack of giant Oreos. So apparently this is this is going on for a
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:16.800]   while. Let me see if I can find the original tweet here. Where is it? Is it give me some
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:21.000]   direction Jeff? Well in that story it should have been there.
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:29.160]   Yeah it wasn't. She's she's I think she's hysterical. She's really like her.
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:33.440]   The Twitter when the pandemic started her and I believe it was like her younger niece
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:41.640]   or some money. Totally just started to blow up. It's random and so just genuine about everything.
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:47.400]   It's actually made her a star again. She's of course famous. Yeah. She was on I don't
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:52.600]   know if you saw through Saturday Night Live impressionist that does her and she came
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:19:00.840]   on the show which was awesome. Let me let me see if I can get her her bio on on Twitter
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:08.460]   is just I am not writing a bio. Not right in the bio. Here it is. Here's the
[02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:14.400]   original tweet. Hello what is your weirdest flavor? Why are you all doing the most? The
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:19.960]   one flavor was fine to which Twitter responds. Well this is fun. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:28.400]   respond. Well this is fun. Hi everybody. Is there a thread here? Then no. She came back
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:32.640]   and she said she's going to get him. This is the story. All right. Let me click the story
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:42.240]   continues because they sent her a very aggressive flavor of Oreos. What flavor?
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:48.800]   She's just leave it. I think that that's the category. After asking Oreo to stick to the
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:54.520]   original flavor they sent me these outrageous items as a response. Java chip flavor cream
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:20:01.660]   Oreo and for you flavored lip balm. But we know about this because when it was Android
[02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:07.520]   Oreo Jason and their company on all about Android every week would have a new Oreo flavor
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:12.360]   and we would have the remnants in our kitchen for days after that because no one wanted
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:19.080]   the you know fruit loop flavored Oreos. It was in steam in the carpet from them barfin
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:26.240]   at the episodes. Oh man. What a mess. What a mess. She says I will be retaliating in
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:31.760]   a later date. And in fact I think she then went on the today show. That's what that's
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:38.480]   where they gave her the huge Oreos on the vision. And so those aren't Photoshop. Those are those
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:45.040]   are real Oreos. Dude that looks so shocked. But I think you cruise past the most important
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:50.840]   bit which was that line I shall be retaliating at a later date is perfect. Yes. That is the
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:57.440]   best line. It's now the mantra for like everybody I know that shall be retaliating at a later
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:06.920]   date. So good day sir. I said good day. All right. There's the there's your DM Warwick
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:16.040]   update for the week. Stacy will be back next week and she will will let her talk then about
[02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:20.240]   her flick buttons. Yeah I thought she was on this. She's all all over the flick buttons.
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:26.320]   She's big fan of those. We'll save anything else from this long list. Poor poor Kathy
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:33.240]   just can't wait to get out of here. I'm sure I have nothing to say about flick. But Kathy
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:37.360]   does have a week. Oh I was substrate for Stacy. I got to come up with something I'm going to
[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:42.240]   flick but get ready. Get ready. I want to give a little credit here because I've been worried
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:46.880]   about Wired magazine. I think Wired magazine. Oh all right. Get ready here. I read this.
[02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:52.680]   I read this and was underwhelmed. You were underwhelmed. I was actually happy. I knew
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:58.680]   you would be when I read it. I thought oh Jeff's going to love this because Wired traditionally
[02:21:58.680 --> 02:22:03.560]   has been techno optimists right. They've been they've been very excited about technology.
[02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:09.600]   That's why they were founded back in the you know the early days of the internet. 1993.
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:16.840]   Well practically that is in the 30s practically. In fact in this piece Gideon Litchfield who's
[02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:22.840]   the current editor in chief writes when Wired was founded in 1993 it was the Bible of techno
[02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:28.120]   utopianism. We chronicled and championed inventions that we thought would remake the world. All
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:34.200]   they needed to be was released. Unleash our cover featured the brilliant renegade visionary
[02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:39.720]   mostly wealthy white male geeks who are shaping the future reshaping human nature making everyone's
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:48.920]   life more efficient. But then like twit and everything else the real world impinged and
[02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:57.120]   Wired starting to get pretty negative right. Quite negative. Yes. Under Gideon. I love
[02:22:57.120 --> 02:23:02.120]   Gideon's a great guy and a great editor but I was worried about Wired. This tug of war
[02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:07.480]   between optimism and pessimism is the reason why I said this feels like an inflection point
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:12.280]   in the history of tech but then that term inflection point falls into the binary trap.
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:16.920]   He doesn't want to do the he said she said you know on the one hand on the other hand.
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:22.040]   It's either it's either one extreme or another. It's not binary. We have to reject this zero or one
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:29.320]   logic but that's when I became disappointed because instead of he just he basically said well
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:37.160]   we got to do both. Which is like mom fine. But it's have a point of view guy.
[02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:42.920]   But it's what he comes around to which is what I'm trying to work on these days too is that
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:48.760]   he pay attention instead to the big problems or I would also say the big opportunities
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:54.600]   and not just technology. How is technology being used? And it is about human beings.
[02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:59.560]   It's not about wires and silicon. And so it could be interesting to see what he does with this.
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:03.480]   We'll see. We'll see. He says I'm not worried. We'll be critical but not cynical.
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:08.600]   Skeptical but not defeatist. We won't tell you what to think about the future but how to think
[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:13.000]   about it. That's a little overboard right there but well that's when I read that.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:18.600]   How is this sounds like a publicist? Yeah well it was what I was saying before like
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:22.280]   we have problems you can't say we don't have problems but you really need to understand them
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:29.160]   if you're going to fix them. So good nuance and tearing apart the issues correctly is important.
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:32.040]   I don't know if that's what he's promising but you could read that.
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:37.640]   In this point I do agree with he says our stance is neither optimism nor pessimism
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:42.520]   but rather the belief that it's worth persisting even when things seem hopeless.
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:49.560]   He then says I call it Greta Tundberg optimism. But whatever the story you should find something
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:52.840]   to learn from it and ideally the inspiration to make a positive difference yourself.
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:56.840]   I'm not good at a lot worse.
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:03.160]   He could have said it's all crap. The whole world's going to hell in a hand.
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:05.000]   We'll do everything if we just turn off the internet.
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:12.120]   Well I mean we were always juggling those. I mean for the last you know seven years
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:18.520]   this show has been juggling how do we feel about it. You've always been kind of the take the
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:23.720]   techno cheerleader. No the freedom the cheerleader of the freedoms we have there.
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:28.840]   Yeah and I've always as a result because I kind of agree with you but as a result I've taken the
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:34.200]   opposite side just to make it a balanced conversation. Just to troll you. Well that's the truth.
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:42.440]   I actually when I was at Conde which owns Wired. At one point when mobile phones became big I
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:50.120]   suggested we rename it Unwired. Wired is a very different magazine from the day it was started by
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:56.280]   Louis Risetto and it was kind of a cookie magazine and intentionally illegible.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:06.440]   That was part of the kind of the look and feel of Wired. It's a very different magazine. It got to
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:13.160]   be a glossy tech magazine which is kind of boring too. So yeah good. Well thanks for that.
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:17.000]   Good. No I'm glad actually glad you brought up. I actually bookmarked it as well because I thought
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.920]   we should talk about it. But now let's take a break and when we come back
[02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:27.640]   picks of the week and yes Kathy has one I'm excited and no there's no Scott Bakula involved at all.
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:31.320]   Although it could be actually other than I look at it.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.680]   Our picks of the week let's give you the pride of place. Now you're going to get me in trouble.
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:43.480]   Can I play this? What do you think?
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:49.480]   Oh my god. Not your lawyer. I can't vouch for it. Oh great. Pass the fuck.
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:51.960]   Just like a lawyer.
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:58.600]   Huey Lewis in the news. A hundred years from now. We'll just cut it out.
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:02.200]   Which I talk about. Do you love Huey Lewis in the news is that?
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:07.400]   I do. This usually comes up in like the first five minutes that people know me but you've
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:11.000]   now known me for two hours. It's about time. So you're from this area.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:17.480]   So I'm going to assume this comes from a deep early relationship with Huey in the band.
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:20.840]   Deep early but I'm not from this area. I'm from New Jersey.
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:24.680]   But yeah. Another reason I knew I liked you.
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:31.720]   Okay. No I've been a huge fan since for most of my life. It very much so
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:35.800]   being a fan sort of was a vehicle for growing up. So it was a big deal for me.
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:40.200]   But one of the things I was thinking about the other day is like I do First Amendment law.
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:45.000]   I was going to be a journalist. Have I always had news in my life in some form?
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:51.000]   Is this coincidence or is this inevitable? But I don't know. But I don't think the band
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.960]   the news really had much to do with the news actually.
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:59.640]   No. It was a great name and the story goes that they originally going to be Huey Lewis in the
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:02.520]   American Express. But then they thought they would get sued.
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:03.000]   I wonder why not.
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:08.120]   So like on the last minute they changed their name to the news.
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:11.400]   It's a good name. So here they go. But yes very close to my heart.
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:15.800]   They're very important to me. But this song has been rattling around in my head this week.
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:19.880]   And I think it's a good metaphor. Incona matter a hundred years from now.
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:29.000]   I think you're right. Or another Marinite. Annie. Oh I can't remember her name. Who wrote a book.
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:32.920]   Basically on the premise that we'll all be dead in a hundred years. So don't worry about it.
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:36.040]   Right. Well one of the interesting things is this new people.
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:42.280]   This song is from 25 years ago. So we're already like a quarter of our way through that century.
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:47.160]   So I don't know what lesson we take out from that. But something.
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:51.960]   That actually is a really good point. Annie Lamont is the woman I was thinking of.
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:58.120]   She says a hundred years from now. All new people. Think about that.
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:05.240]   Right. Jeff. Do you have a number? I'm going to get you through two numbers really quickly here
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:13.320]   because I want to get to the really really important news. One is that Axios reports
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:17.720]   that news consumption. We kind of do this but Axios does what Axios does. Well it has
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:24.440]   has fallen off a cliff. And once again I put the wrong link up. It's Axios. I try to find the right
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:28.840]   link for Axios. It's down farther. It's her newsletter. So it goes on and on. Anyway.
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:32.120]   It's falling off a cliff. I said I was going to do this quickly. This is as fast as I'm going to
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:37.240]   go through. Thank you go through the change. Well actually I've been interested in this because
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:43.240]   we were getting our lunch handed to us by the daily and up first and all the news shows during
[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:48.600]   the COVID crisis and during Trump's four years. It really hurt our numbers dramatically.
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:52.920]   Wow. While their numbers went up and up and up and up. And I was just I've actually been very
[02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:58.280]   curious. I notice I don't listen to the daily and the daily news shows as much as I used to. I don't
[02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:02.760]   watch the news as much as I used to. I'm not surprised by that. Right? Wait a minute. Good.
[02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:08.360]   The other thing is I'm glad to hear it. Good. That's also happening. Is it so called and
[02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:14.040]   that's not a great definition. So called user generated content a phrase I've hated since the
[02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:22.520]   beginning now represents 39% of time spent with media according to variety. This is why old media
[02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:27.320]   hate the internet. There's a connection. Yeah. It's all those people watching TikTok tea.
[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:34.520]   Right. Okay. So now let's get past it. Do we just can I ask a point of order? Do we are
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:39.240]   this user generated content? No. Well, that's the thing variety definitions a little bit
[02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:43.320]   off. Like they call they call YouTube videos use generate content. So on YouTube, yes, you would
[02:30:43.320 --> 02:30:51.720]   be that. See, that's wrong. So I think of TikTok. I think of, you know, reels those that's
[02:30:51.720 --> 02:30:56.600]   Instagram. Parts of YouTube are parts of YouTube. Most some YouTube is but mostly YouTube is also
[02:30:56.600 --> 02:31:04.200]   there are people now and BC news video. Yeah. But the most important story of now we're going to
[02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:07.160]   get to the one that really matters. This is the most important of the entire show. If you've made
[02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:11.800]   it this far, congratulations, because now you're going to learn the thing you're going to thank
[02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:16.360]   me for. I'm leaving immediately after this to go get this myself. I found out right before the show.
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:21.880]   It's a miracle. I'm actually here because I should have just gone. It's greater Joe's to go by.
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:30.440]   Hot Joe a pay pay puffs. Miss. I bet they're delicious. The week actually I bet they're really
[02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:37.640]   good. Yeah. Can you imagine? Oh, I'm excited to know that there's a slash R trader Joe's subreddit.
[02:31:37.640 --> 02:31:44.920]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. My wife said this to me. Yeah. Catch you. Pippey. Knowing how would it go to my
[02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:53.560]   heart? It's gluten free too. So goodness. All right. Catch you. I pick a
[02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:58.840]   pepper B. Jim or B is not going to be allowed to have them because he didn't fix caught you a
[02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:05.240]   pepper the right way and then complained about it. So you're not allowed. Oh, oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
[02:32:05.240 --> 02:32:12.840]   Ladies, gentlemen, and Pruitt from Hands on Photography. What's your pick? What's your thing this week?
[02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:19.720]   My pick is I like I mentioned earlier in the show, I just got the news about Canon's
[02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:26.360]   CES coverage and well, CES information. So I want to try to catch up on that and they're talking
[02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:32.600]   about Project Kokomo. This is essentially their VR platform that they're putting together. There's
[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:39.480]   the still in development. Yeah. And yeah, it does mention the fish eyed lenses on the R5, but there's
[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:45.960]   also reports that you don't necessarily need an R5. You can use a Canon M200. We know that camera
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:52.760]   all very well. So there's a lot of meat to pick through here. So I'm going to check that out as soon
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:59.000]   as we're off the air. But yeah, I'm always interested in what these folks are. And we, you know,
[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:04.200]   because we're not at CES this year and you know, we're relying on coverage from people like you.
[02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:10.040]   And I should mention that Father Robert, who is a CES is going to notice on this week in Tech on
[02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:16.120]   Sunday. Oh, yeah. So we will get some CES news in there. So and there is there is some news. So
[02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:23.160]   a lot of car stuff. Yeah, like the new auto show. No, no, no, no. There's always in the North
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:27.720]   Hall was always full of cars and car accessories. It was a whole hall always. Maybe there's something
[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:35.800]   to talk about like BMW's color changing paint. There's an innovation life needs. What else
[02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:42.600]   do you got for us in next since I was on vacation, I said I was going to try my best to be on vacation
[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:48.840]   and watch some television stuff like that. So Queen Pruitt came across a movie called Vacation
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:56.440]   Friends starring Lil Rel Howie and John Cena. Oh, gosh. It was so dad gum funny.
[02:33:56.440 --> 02:34:02.440]   Rotten Tomatoes score doesn't say so, but that movie was so dad. I actually saw the trailer for
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:06.760]   this and I thought it looked pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was on I think it's on Hulu.
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:13.320]   I believe it's Hulu. Yes. Well, you can catch it. It's a Hulu film. Yes. But it is so, so funny.
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:20.200]   But definitely check that out. And lastly, I want to give a shout out to blackwomenphotographers.com.
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:25.640]   I've been following them on Instagram and it's great seeing what they're doing to try to help
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:30.760]   promote black female photographers and help them continue to get work in this industry.
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:37.080]   In this house, we've talked about it a lot far as things can be tough on
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:45.240]   me and society on my boys and society, because of color or skin. But what they tend to forget is
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:49.640]   how bad Queen Pruitt has it at times. I've seen some things with my own eyes that
[02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:53.800]   it's a double. It's a double. It's a double. It's a double. Yeah.
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:59.400]   Yeah. She's a woman. I walk in the room and things immediately change. I'm like, really? That's
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:03.400]   not cool. Yeah. But I want to give them a shout out because they've been working with the likes of
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:08.840]   Netflix and Nike and a lot of big brands and getting women, black women work in the photography
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:16.440]   field. So kudos to blackwomenphotographers.com. Nice. Yeah. I will check it out. Very cool.

[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:13.720]   stuff into absolutely absolutely. And Pruitt hosts hands on photography. I'm sure you'll see some
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:21.080]   canon news there and a lot of other important information. Twitter TV slash HOP. If you love

[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:42.680]   bit about this. Yeah, I'm excited. What's coming up? On the 13th, we have the book club with Miss

[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:55.160]   have thoughts. Annalene Lewis is a wonderful novel. Autonomous. And then right after that.
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:37:02.360]   And then right after that, the next day, we're hosting an AMA with our very own Mr. Andy and
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:09.080]   Notco. Very interesting man. And I can't wait to pick his brain and allow our club Twit members

[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:47.640]   baby. Who would want a jingle? In radio it was always the kiss of death. As soon as they got
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:53.240]   a jingle package, Leo, LePorn in the afternoon, you were going to get canceled for sure.
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:58.920]   Guarantee. And it works. By the way, it really works. You still have your jingles? You know,

[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:10.600]   could show names or just. I'm trying. It was. Wait, there were a bunch of them. Mostly it was
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:14.200]   just the radio stations jingle and then they would shout your name.
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:23.320]   Build your own radio station. You've always wanted to. Clock FM is you with Leo LePorn.
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:29.720]   And then that was. But I had a template. Yeah, there was a template. A template was made,
