[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.840]   and Facebook and Twitter and all of that.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.240]   And we got a great-- oh, we got--
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.400]   this is the classic panel right here.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.160]   Start with Jeff Jarvis, who's in Davos for the World Economic
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.680]   Forum, and he's half out.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.920]   Are you in the clubhouse there at Davos?
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920]   No, I'm in the media center.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.080]   Is Warren Buffett just going to peer over your shoulder
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.720]   at some moment?
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.040]   Bono going to say?
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.120]   Or is there a drill?
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.040]   There's free drinks.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.520]   I'm just going to--
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.000]   Hot chocolate for the machine.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.640]   All right.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.680]   And there's a janitor, and that's it.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.680]   That's it.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.840]   Everybody else is off of parties.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.400]   Not me.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.880]   Not me because I'm going to get a huge party from the street.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.080]   Thank you.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.320]   I'm not there.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.880]   I'm sitting here on a silly podcast.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.720]   We'll make a deal.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.320]   We should make a deal like when can Jeff go to the party?
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.160]   Like the first time somebody says a damn.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.960]   Should go over the street.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.000]   That's easy because I'll say it.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.040]   Do a bit of it.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.120]   Matt Cutz is here.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.080]   Yeah!
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.600]   Hey, Matt Cutz.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.480]   Hey, how's it going, everybody?
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.760]   Matt Cutz.com/blog.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.920]   He is unaffiliated.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.440]   Is this your tribute to what's his name?
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.040]   The guy who did the bear show and died?
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.520]   Dan Haggardee?
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.120]   And Haggardee.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.840]   Is your Dan Haggardee's--
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.520]   He's got his grizzly Adam's beard on.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.640]   He does.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.600]   It's just laziness.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.200]   That's all.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.240]   But it comes and goes.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.880]   So you don't want to want my beard as longer?
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.440]   Why?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.160]   Because I pride myself so much on packing.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.600]   I decided to grow it so I wouldn't
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.960]   have to bring the beard trimmer.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.960]   Wow.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.560]   A little floaty.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.080]   Wow.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.640]   Because that would add two ounces.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.920]   Wow.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.920]   That's how serious I am.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.600]   And also here, as if we didn't have an embarrassment of riches,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.280]   Kevin Marks is here too.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.040]   Hi, Kevin.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.280]   Hi there.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.760]   Good to see you.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.120]   Good to see you too.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.600]   This is a perfect cast to talk about anything
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.880]   they want to talk about.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.080]   I mean, I will sit and listen in rapture and wrapped.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.800]   I don't even want to--
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.680]   Talk about him.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.720]   Or we could talk about him.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.000]   Because there's been a little tweet back and forth going on.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.720]   In fact, I think these two have been involved a little bit
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.920]   in it, as I have been with Jonathan Abrams.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.120]   And all of us.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.840]   All of us.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.480]   And Matt too.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.920]   Oh, you weighed in as well.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.800]   OK, well then we better start with this.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.520]   So Jonathan Abrams is the founder of Nuzzle,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.840]   which we all agree is fantastic, spectacular.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.240]   Nuzzle is a website originally.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.920]   Now an app.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.080]   It's on iOS.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.080]   I think it's on Android too.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.920]   Yeah, I can't remember.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.400]   Uh-huh.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.360]   And it's a news app.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.600]   It uses social signals from Facebook and Twitter
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.920]   to give you news you can get into.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.240]   I don't want to say news you can use.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.480]   That's probably trademarked.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.600]   And one of the things when AMP was announced at Google,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.760]   one of the things that Nuzzle was very early on about--
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.120]   and Jonathan's a little cagey about how they
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.560]   are interfacing with this.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.640]   But I gathered from his cageiness
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.480]   that perhaps they had an early relationship with Google.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.040]   That when you click on an article that has been amped,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   you'll get the AMP page.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.240]   Now I'm on a desktop.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.440]   So I won't get that.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.200]   Is that right?
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.160]   You have to be a mobile.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.800]   Do we know?
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.440]   No one knows.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   Anybody?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.080]   No, I mean, if you go to the AMP page,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.240]   it'll work on desktop as well because it's just web stuff.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.920]   Yeah, but it will-- well, the question is,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   will Nuzzle send me to-- because every AMP page,
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.480]   normally every AMP page has a standard web page
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.880]   associated with it, right?
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.640]   Yeah, Nuzzle will send you to the AMP page if it exists.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.280]   No matter what.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.880]   I think so.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.280]   Is medium amped?
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.800]   Oh, no.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.720]   I refer you to our conversation from a few weeks back
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.320]   with Richard Gingers, head of news at Google.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.200]   He was talking about AMP.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.600]   And actually, it's timely because AMP is about to go public.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.200]   Yeah, at the end of February.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.320]   Well, they're going to IP it already?
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.760]   Not that kind of public.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.960]   But it's been in beta up to this point, right?
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.080]   And limited as to who can use it or no?
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.480]   No, that's a double standard.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.400]   Sorry, anybody can put it up.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.880]   OK.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.360]   So what--
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.160]   But it hasn't been integrated into anything
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.280]   at Google except that test page.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.320]   Oh, so the-- OK.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.760]   So-- and by the way, that's to me in some ways
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.400]   a little bit of the controversy about AMP
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.560]   is that Google says we're going to favor AMP sites.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.880]   Well, favor might be a little--
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.840]   No, no, no.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.320]   Let Matt address this.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.560]   Let Matt address this because he knows something
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.840]   about Google and search.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.600]   Well, yeah.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.120]   A smidge.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.720]   Just a smidge.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.280]   So typically, you know, you care about the quality.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.920]   So if a higher quality site is a better answer or result,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.880]   then you want to return that.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.240]   But speed will certainly be part of that quality, right?
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.760]   I hate it.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.040]   It's more of a smaller ingredient compared to, you know,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.320]   things like the page rank or how well we think it answers
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.080]   the user's question.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.800]   But if it's a relatively small difference between two pages,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.920]   then if one is much faster, then you
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.760]   can imagine that would help with the ranking.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.680]   But it's not going to be like your page is faster,
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.160]   so you outrank everybody else even though they're
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.040]   better resources.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.880]   It's definitely-- you know, you look for the best pages
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.720]   and then you do take speed into account,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.000]   but it's not going to be like three times more
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.280]   valuable as a signal than some other quality signal,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.760]   for example.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.920]   So the purpose, state of purpose of AMP,
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.840]   is to provide a subset of the full web stack
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   and to create pages that load faster for users, right?
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.000]   Is that kind of in summary succinct enough?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.840]   It does this by doing a number of things, including
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.760]   caching pages on Google and other servers,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.040]   although to date it's Google-only servers.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.160]   And it also has a subset of JavaScript that's allowed.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.440]   I'm looking through my Twitter because I'm
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.280]   trying to find this conversation we had.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.000]   Jonathan Abrams was saying how much he likes.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.960]   So he's integrated it into-- what do you call it?
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.120]   Into nuzzles, right?
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.240]   You've seen this.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.560]   As I would if I were Jonathan Abrams.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.440]   So if I click on something that is AMP enabled,
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.720]   like this NY times one, you see a little flash like that,
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.760]   lightning bolt, and then it loads the page directly.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.920]   So it loads very quickly.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.280]   Let me look at that on desktop.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.920]   I'm going to do the same thing.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.480]   It did not do that on desktop.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.880]   It did not do that on desktop.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.200]   So let me do that again.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   This is from Nuzzle clicking a NY Times article.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.880]   And while it did load fast because it
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.520]   cached it, it is not an AMP version of NY Times.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.840]   And you could tell just by looking at it,
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.520]   because this bit's probably unapproved JavaScript
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.000]   and so forth.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Right.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.560]   Whereas if I click the NY Mag one, it takes longer.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.960]   It's not a space letter.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.920]   So I click that one.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.800]   It's not terrible, but it uses a little one.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.120]   Also, subtext maybe, somewhat maybe in the foreground,
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.000]   response to the ad blocker boycott--
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.320]   and I'm going to call it a boycott.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.520]   People using ad blocker to boycott advertising on the web.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.640]   And in response to kind of out of control ad tech,
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.920]   there are ads in AMP.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.800]   In fact, one of the news stories of this week
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.120]   is that companies like--
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.480]   if I kind of surprised me, Outbrain and Tebulli
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.160]   will be part of the AMP project.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.760]   Tebula.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.600]   These are two advertising tech companies.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.360]   I would prefer did not be part of the AMP project.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.560]   Outbrain.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.360]   And Tebula 2 are the ones that add, you like this story,
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.600]   you're going to love this story about belly fat,
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.840]   to the bottom of many websites.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.000]   But the next thing--
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.360]   That's the last thing at this.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.720]   Well, one nice thing is AMP says, OK,
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.400]   you know what the ad size is in advance.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.000]   And so you don't have the page stuttering up and down
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.320]   as you're trying to load it.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.000]   As you're about to click on something,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.360]   suddenly the link changes and now it's an ad or something
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.080]   like that.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.280]   And there's also formats that are faster and sort of standardized.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.600]   And so you're not going to have this pop up that sort of floats
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.080]   around on the page and blocks everything.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.600]   So it's intended to make the web faster.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.120]   But I think the nice thing is users
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.080]   will like it as well because they can sort of understand, OK,
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.960]   this is something that I can tell is the article.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.800]   This is something that is definitely an ad.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.200]   And it's not the case that the ad has to be annoying.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.320]   It can be reasonable and fast.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.760]   And I think users will like that.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.720]   A fast outbrain is no better.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.440]   Well, but the thing about the point
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.560]   is that outbrain is a there's a pattern there, which
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.440]   is here's some other stuff you might like to read.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.040]   And there was--
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.200]   If you have no way for the release stream,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.160]   it's mostly link bait, you think?
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.480]   So there's this notion of story cards,
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.240]   which is here's a bunch of previews of other sites
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.400]   that you want to need could be standardized that.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.800]   But that got a bit sidelined into,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.920]   can we have a templating language, which is a shame.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.000]   There was a bug that we wrote there.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.720]   So in fact, you just pushed along the GitHub link intent
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.520]   to implement AMP template.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.000]   So basically, we started out-- the conversation started out
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.880]   being how do we do these story card
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.200]   like things at the bottom from someone at the Guardian.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.680]   And we went back and forth on, oh, yeah, there's ways to do that.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.200]   And I pitched micro formats in any web,
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.720]   because that's what I do, because actually we solve this problem.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.840]   And then they were like, oh, we need a templating language,
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.400]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.520]   And then this became-- we're going to implement templating
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   language.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.360]   So I'm not quite sure how that actually helps in terms
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.400]   of standardizing the idea of story cards.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.040]   Because the thing is, the story card idea
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.200]   is basically the same idea as content, description,
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.840]   formula, and RSS, and all these things
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.800]   that we've had for nearly 20 years, which
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.840]   is how do I get a set of summaries from one side
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.280]   onto another side.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.640]   You know, this is in terms of solve problems,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.000]   we have solved the problem.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.600]   But everyone seems to want to do something more complicated
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.520]   each time we try and do it, which is frustrating.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.400]   I can understand why somebody like Jonathan Ambers
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.240]   would love AMP, because it makes his app fast and respond
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.160]   better, and people are reading stuff in his--
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.120]   in Nuzzle, and I do, I use Nuzzle.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.800]   He said I kind of fundamentally misunderstood,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.360]   or I can't remember if he was that broad.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.240]   He said I misunderstood AMP, or misrepresented it in some ways.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.200]   Well, great, but we can cut to the chases
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.280]   that I asked him to be on the show next week, and he said, sure.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.280]   Oh, good.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.000]   So we can--
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.080]   What are we talking about then?
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.280]   So we get his point of share.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.840]   So we get his point of share.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   So we get his point of share.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.960]   So the other point is that the thing
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.480]   that I showed a minute ago inside Nuzzle
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.640]   was that he's implemented displaying AMP stuff in Nuzzle.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.600]   Right.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.240]   And the question I asked of Google, also in the project,
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.280]   which I think I dropped in there a couple of minutes ago,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.080]   was that's great, but is there a way to--
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.280]   we can all embed AMP things because they're HTML,
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.360]   so we can just embed them as an iframe, and that will work.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.680]   Because there's a link, there's a URL to an AMP page.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.880]   And an AMP page is a web page with one particular gem
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.840]   library and a bunch of other markup that--
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.520]   But is there a way to deduce an AMP page from a URL?
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.520]   Can you just add AMP?
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.800]   Yeah, they've got a URL tag that's
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.560]   fine for which way to find the AMP page.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.080]   So you have to look into the page to see it, though.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.680]   You can't just--
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.520]   Well, yeah.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.040]   But if you're a parser, you can do that.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.520]   If you're fetching it something anyway, you can do that.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.520]   So no one baked this in a while ago.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.000]   And your website has it, and my website has it,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.200]   because then, hopefully, did that for us.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.360]   But the thing that Google hasn't said
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.520]   just hasn't released code for is
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.440]   how to do the thing that they did in the demo thing, which
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.560]   is where you have multiple AMP things,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.000]   and it preloads the next one and fetches it
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.400]   so you can swap between them instantly, which
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.360]   is one of the most compelling parts of the demo.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.760]   Whereas if you actually have to tear down an iframe,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.560]   and you create an iframe, and fetch everything each time
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.920]   you click, they still have some overhead.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.680]   And so the question I was asking in that issue
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.000]   was, can we have some some code for doing that, please?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.600]   Because that would be useful for those of us who
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.640]   want to embed things and other things.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.560]   And that's not-- that's not ready yet.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.840]   And we'll talk with--
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.080]   Maybe that'll show up.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.640]   We'll talk with John in the next week.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.160]   My objection to AMP is essentially
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.600]   that it feels like it's forking the web.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.880]   Matt, do you have a response to you?
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.320]   Yeah, I do.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.960]   And I appreciate that you have played devil's advocate with this.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.640]   And the fact that you just launched your new site that
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.320]   is very JavaScript heavy, which is sort of the opposite
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.480]   into the spectrum from the I have one article,
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   and I want to put it up, and here's two or three ads
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.560]   to do with it.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.880]   There are a couple new things.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.280]   One is just today Google added AMP error reporting
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.480]   to the search console.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.880]   So for people who want to try to support AMP,
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.600]   you can get a lot more help with it now.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.000]   And that's sort of automated.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.280]   And that's available to everybody.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.680]   The other thing is, after I was on this week in Google
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.080]   with Jeff side by side, I talked to a couple people
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.320]   on the web spam team who have actually worked on the validator
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.440]   for AMP pages.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.640]   And I love that people in web spam do this consistently.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.760]   One person, she worked on the birthday doodle.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.280]   Another person worked on support for HTTPS.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.760]   And from that conversation, from one of the people
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.240]   who worked on the validator, I feel
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.560]   much better about that Google's intent
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.680]   is trying to do the best it can to try to make sure
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.240]   that we support an open web.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.000]   And I think Richard Jinkress and everybody else
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.200]   realizes that if it's not something that's
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   open and federated and supported by a ton of publishers
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.160]   and offers the options that they need--
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.760]   so for example, there's another URL in the rundown
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.920]   about supporting subscriptions and paywalls
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.080]   and that sort of stuff.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.000]   If you don't support the sort of things that publishers need
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.600]   and that users want, so it's a win on both sides,
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.920]   then it's not going to take off.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.800]   And people will just go to proprietary wild gardens.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.840]   And so from what I've heard from talking to people inside Google,
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.440]   I actually feel pretty optimistic
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.840]   that this will be a pretty nice win in terms of, instead
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.560]   of having 20 different analytics, little beacons,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.520]   you could just have one analytics include.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.400]   And then that would be able to power the chart
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.760]   beads or the Google Analytics that you want to do.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   And I do think you'll end up with a better experience.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.520]   Your point is, well taken.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.320]   What if Google has veto power on what
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.440]   goes in the JavaScript to create the widgets?
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.280]   But from talking to the person that I talked to at Google,
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.560]   I do feel better about that.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.880]   They're going to try to support as much as they can
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.080]   and still try to be reasonable.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.360]   And I don't want to spend a lot of time--
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.000]   it sounds like we'll be talking about this next week.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.480]   But you hadn't been able to weigh in all this time.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.640]   You've been running along, listening to Twig,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.240]   completely unable to shout at us.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.880]   Is there anything else on your mind you want to talk about?
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.480]   No, I was listening to Twig.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.080]   And you said, Matt Cutz is probably running right now.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.160]   And I was literally on the treadmill, right?
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.680]   And I was like, yes.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.240]   Everybody in the gym is like, what's that guy doing?
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   Why is he yelling?
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.120]   Anyway, it's good to be back.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.000]   It's wonderful to have you.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.160]   Jeff, how's Davos?
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.920]   Has it started?
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.080]   The World Economic Forum?
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:49.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.800]   Well, busy day, I came from a reception
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   so I thought they were vacuuming around me.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.840]   I came from a-- you see that?
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.440]   This is kind of poignant.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.760]   I feel like it's an Edward Hopper painting, like Nighthawks
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.480]   at the Davos.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.920]   The baddest working hard.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.840]   You need to get a release.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.840]   Like me.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.680]   No, you don't need to get a release.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.520]   This is a podcast.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.400]   No one cares.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.440]   What's so much?
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.920]   So Facebook, as a big presence here this year,
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   they built a whole two-story pavilion right
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.120]   by the bus stop by the Congress Center, which is a big deal.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.200]   And so they had a little reception for some media people.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.240]   They went to Sheryl's, Amber, and was there.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.200]   And at it, they're showing off the fact
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.480]   of how wonderful they are to the net.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.440]   And they have some of the material
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.760]   from the big winged drone there.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.680]   It's amazingly light, the carbon fiber stuff.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   And they have a little display about how they're
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.000]   bringing internet to the world with internet door.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.080]   And so they're really here in presence.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.600]   Google, they're here, but they're not
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.440]   being as visible by a long shot.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.480]   So that's, I thought, interesting,
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.880]   that they were hanging around.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.520]   Is the World Economic Forum as big a deal as it was,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.120]   back in the day when it was Bono hobnobbing with Bill Gates?
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.000]   Well, those are your standards for world politics, Leo.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.320]   That's the people around the world.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.400]   Let's face it.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.960]   We do have-- I think Bono's here and Leo DiCaprio's here.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.840]   Oh, wow.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.240]   That's actually pretty good.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.080]   And how about Angela Merkel?
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.680]   Is she there?
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.280]   Oh, no.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.000]   No, she didn't show up this year.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.960]   Are there world leaders?
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.520]   No, Biden is here making an investment in the traffic.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.880]   Tomorrow I get to be in a session
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.640]   with the new head of Argentina and the new head of Canada.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.480]   I'm very excited about the evening.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.600]   I saw him today.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.480]   He's a boy.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.600]   And I'm going to get in trouble with your listeners, Leo.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.360]   But don't blame him.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.440]   Blame me.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.320]   The contrast between Trudeau and Trump across the border
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.160]   is just phenomenal.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.200]   Trudeau and Harper.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.520]   I mean--
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.400]   Well, that too.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.000]   That too.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.040]   That will make the Canadians happy for the most part
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.440]   if we say that.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.680]   I know.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.520]   But he was charming and amazing today.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.440]   I don't know.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.240]   I for one minute--
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.160]   I look forward to a Trump-Paylen ticket in 2016.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.920]   Oh, geez.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.760]   I think that's exciting.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.440]   Did you see the daily news from Page?
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.120]   Yes.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.440]   I'm with stupid.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.080]   I was stupid.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.760]   And they're both pointing at each other.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.600]   That's very great.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.360]   I didn't realize the daily news was such a leftist rag.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.000]   It really is the last--
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.720]   In the last six months or so, they
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.400]   have done brilliant Page 1s.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.040]   Brilliant.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.360]   Well, Trump's given them a lot of fuel for that.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.960]   So tomorrow I'll focus.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.120]   And I'm sure we talk about AMB.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:47.240]   How long before the Univision buys the daily news?
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.880]   That's my question.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.720]   That's a good question.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.960]   Because Univision sold what they bought this money.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.680]   They bought the onion.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.360]   Yeah, it's cool, I think.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.000]   Well, I loved NPR's headline.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.240]   What was it?
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.280]   Area newspaper sold to Univision.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.080]   No kidding.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.960]   And no kidding.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.560]   Yeah, they had to add that.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   That was great.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.760]   Yeah, I think it's--
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.080]   People went after me on Twitter saying what is stupid move.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.320]   And I don't know.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.040]   I think it's great.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.440]   It's new.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.760]   No, it's a new Univision.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.200]   Because they're recognizing that they're
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.280]   natural audience, which is Spanish speaking Latinos in the US,
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.000]   is dwindling because the second generation are speaking English.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.920]   And they're not watching Univision.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.560]   And if you want to reach those millennials, humor is the best way.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.640]   And so it actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.640]   They started Fusion.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.600]   That was with NBCUniversal, right?
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.360]   ABC.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.040]   ABC, which is backing out.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.840]   They're backing out of Fusion?
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.440]   ABC is.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.480]   Yeah, ABC is interesting.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.400]   Interesting.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.840]   They have a couple of brilliant executives.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.120]   They're Isaac Lee is in charge of Univision Digital and Fusion.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.000]   Borja at El Rhea is in charge of digital news.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.960]   And they're really bright.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.880]   They're doing neat things.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.640]   So yeah, it's not a bad call.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.920]   I think they're probably too smart to watch a newspaper.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.040]   Although they wouldn't mind going after Trump a little bit
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.000]   after he went after--
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.760]   True.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.440]   True.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.520]   Miss Universe contest.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.840]   I was just going to say, if you're talking to Trudeau,
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.480]   he was just opening up Google's helping to open up Google's
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.880]   Waterloo office.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.120]   And something I didn't know, apparently, he actually learned
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.160]   or knows how to code in C++.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.560]   What?
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.120]   I think everybody under 40 knows C++, isn't that the case?
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.040]   That, and he's a skateboard instructor.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:32.880]   Hey, as soon as I have a photo.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   Easy.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.040]   Really true, though, is it a coder?
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.800]   Yeah, not only am I a former teacher,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.600]   but I also, when I was studying engineering,
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.440]   got halfway decent as a coder in C++, he says,
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.880]   can you imagine if the president of the United States
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.000]   could code in C++?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.200]   Well, to his credit, Obama has promoted coding as the--
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.640]   maybe over promoted the future coding for the future.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.080]   But that's impressive.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   Wow.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.320]   Wow.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:06.080]   Because C++ is a non-trivial undertaking by all accounts.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.400]   I will try to ask.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.080]   I don't know if they could DHP, but C++ is impressive.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.720]   Say, can you give us some cold samples?
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.960]   What's your GitHub reputation?
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.960]   Do you have any commits?
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:24.000]   That phoebe is-- OK, so phoebe a question
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.120]   I could actually ask besides that.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.320]   Oh, you got to ask him the one for President Obama,
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.640]   which was basically, if you had to sort a million numbers,
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.320]   would you go with a bubble sort or a quick sort?
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.720]   You know, and he'll be like, definitely not a bubble sort.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   And then everybody can clap.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.520]   That would be awesome.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.600]   It would be pretty awesome.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:52.920]   Well, you know, I have been reading Donald Knuth lately.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:58.560]   And as a matter of fact, wow.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.520]   Wow, there you go, programmer humor.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.800]   I can't-- there is a lot of AMP news,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.680]   but I'm going to--
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.040]   I guess I should defer it.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.360]   Good article though in the Monday note, which is--
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.120]   I was reading that.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.680]   That actually looks good.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   Let us do the little put together.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:15.680]   I thought so.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.760]   This is from Fredi Rieck-Filu, who co-authors this
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.440]   with Jean-Louis Gasey.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.600]   Google's AMP poised to take the lead from Facebook
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.640]   and Apple's walled guards.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.440]   And that is the point that Jonathan Abrams made as well,
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.960]   is, hey, if the alternative is Facebook or Apple, Apple News,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.400]   or Facebook's, what are they, call them stories?
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.360]   Then this is a better solution.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.000]   And I think it really isn't necessarily a better solution.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.960]   It's just, who do you trust?
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   Google, Facebook, or Apple.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.760]   I think they're similar solutions in some ways, aren't they?
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.120]   Well, they're similar in that they're
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.680]   all HTML subsets, which means that you have to, like,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.200]   Monday--
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.760]   One's open source.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   Google's one is open source and is closer to HTML,
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.600]   though it still has a bunch of weirdness
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.760]   in like re-farting image and audio and video.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.200]   Facebook's one--
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.360]   I don't remember which one--
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.040]   which one of which Facebook's one is--
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.600]   is kind of its own subset of HTML
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.160]   with a bunch of weird suggestions of what you use.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.880]   So it's basically parsing bits of HTML, ignoring other bits.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.760]   And Apple's one is two things.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.240]   There's sort of strange hybrid because it's partly RSS
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.200]   with HTML in and partly its own markup, XML language, which
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.680]   is kind of like the stuff they use for the Apple TV
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.880]   and the stuff that is internal to the iTunes store.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.960]   So basically, you end up having to write a translator
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.760]   from your content management system into three new markup
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.840]   languages.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.960]   And also, Google's one is the simplest of those, I think,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.200]   because it is mostly HTML.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.360]   Is it conceivable, Matt, there could
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.120]   be some sort of preprocessor that
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.640]   would you could run your page through and get all three?
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.280]   I mean, there's already WordPress plugins, for example,
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.080]   so that you don't have to worry about it yourself.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.960]   So in theory, you can have something like that
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   that generates it.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.080]   I think, for me, the bigger hurdle
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.000]   is how do you get into Apple News?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.800]   I'm not exactly sure what the process for that would be.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.400]   With Google, you just add your rel amp link or whatever,
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.200]   and it sort of can get auto-discovered.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.480]   But I'm not sure what the filter is for Facebook or Apple News.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.480]   The other thing that you talk about a little bit
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.600]   is the paywall issue.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.160]   He says AMP engineering is consistently
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.080]   asked by publishers ranging from Wall Street Journal,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.400]   New York Times, and the Financial Times to Lazeco
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.520]   for some way to have paywalls work with AMP.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.600]   And that's difficult because of the multiple caches involved,
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.960]   but apparently AMP engineers--
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.480]   They're working on that, say--
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.240]   The paywall places want some helpful paywalls
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.960]   from both AMP and instant articles.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.080]   I'd love to see AMP say, no paywall.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.560]   That's the solution.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.200]   No paywall.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.680]   Well, but the problem is you want to help publishers,
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.640]   because if you don't have a strong web,
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.840]   then to have that you need publishers.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.920]   But we try to help with first click free, for example,
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.760]   which is Google search results.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.840]   So there's been a lot of attempts to support that.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.600]   Or unlimited viewing of a document
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.840]   as a few points out where you get the first half
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.720]   of the document, but then--
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.560]   Or AMP.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.000]   Or Google contributor.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.080]   But you have to solve this problem for publishers.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.880]   So I think it's good that Google's trying--
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.080]   and AMP is trying to tackle that problem.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.480]   By the way, I have to say I use Google contributor,
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.640]   and I'm seeing it more and more places.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.640]   I'm really pleased about that.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.200]   That, to me, more than AMP is a contribution
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.680]   to this whole ad blocking fiasco.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.640]   Is it-- what do you think, Jeff, of characterizing
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.680]   as Doc Serrels and others, of characterizing the ad
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.120]   blocking as a boycott?
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.000]   I think that's a fairer argument, don't you?
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.920]   It is us as users saying nothing against you news
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.720]   organizations or your website, guys,
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.200]   but we're going to boycott your ads.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.000]   Yeah, I think we messed up the web.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.960]   We publishers messed up the web with advertisers.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.920]   I don't even blame publishers.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.040]   I really blame the ad tech, guys.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.880]   I blame-- well, we--
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.040]   Oh, ad tech too.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   But just ad salespeople, ad agencies, brands,
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.360]   we all just threw more junk on.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   And then with it, you know, I owe it
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.280]   another line of JavaScript, and we messed up the web.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.320]   Doc Serrels had a great blog post a couple of days ago,
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.200]   rethinking John Wanamaker.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.920]   Wanamaker is the guy who probably didn't say it,
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.920]   apparently, but is a great quote.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.880]   He says, I know half of my ads don't work.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.920]   I just don't know which half.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.600]   But he makes the point that really,
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.480]   brand ads are the kind of advertising people
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.080]   should be embarked on.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.520]   He said, this whole notion that targeting people,
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.880]   aiming like with laser-like precision,
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.360]   at somebody who has done a search for men's undergarments
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.560]   and bombarding them, he says, we
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.000]   don't know if somebody's in the market.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.600]   We can't tell.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.880]   There's no way of knowing if they're about to buy.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.520]   He said, the best way to advertise
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.400]   is with brand advertising.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.400]   A brand-- this is from a Journal of Advertising Research
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.800]   article, The Waste in Advertising
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.360]   is the part that works.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.920]   Brand advertising has the effect of making a company familiar
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.320]   whether the audience likes it or not.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.280]   And that is a requirement for any large company
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.560]   selling to a large market.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.320]   You may never buy a Ford F-150 truck,
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.000]   but your damn sure going to know about it
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.120]   if you watch football on TV.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.000]   In other words, it doesn't hurt to have everybody
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.200]   you know who you are and what you sell.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.960]   And when the time comes to buy something,
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.040]   those familiar names leap to mind.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:29:00.520]   He says, ad tech really misunderstands.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.840]   It's not an effective way to reach people.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.400]   I mean, aside from the thing that's
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.080]   annoyed your customers to the point
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:12.280]   where they're blocking you, that's a side effect.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.720]   But he says, this is kind of a misunderstanding
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.880]   of how advertising works.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.960]   And Doc is-- I kind of agree with him.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.040]   Doc's a guy wrote the Clue Train with F-S-Tow
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.960]   and got wrote it.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.960]   Go ahead.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.960]   Well, that's it.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   There's kind of three kinds of advertising.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.280]   There's the stuff that Doc is talking about there,
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.880]   which is the brand advertising, which is,
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.320]   I want to show this to a large number of people
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.240]   and a friend in the world.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.960]   Right.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.080]   And that's the kind of ads you see on major networks
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.680]   on the Super Bowl, that kind of thing.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.440]   That's not the direct response part.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.520]   Actual billboards, as you say,
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.800]   the whole world is a classic thing there.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.160]   Then there's the very strongly targeted advertising,
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.680]   which is basically the thing Google invented
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.080]   with search advertising, which is,
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.600]   I know you're searching for something
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.880]   and I will discreetly add some links to the side
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.440]   that give you places to buy that thing.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.600]   And that's, again, clearly valuable because it's targeted.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.240]   And then there's this fuzzy thing in the middle,
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.280]   which is this notional targeted stuff, which
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.200]   is the stuff that Maché Chéclovski writes about wonderfully,
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.360]   where basically there's this giant arms race together,
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.720]   more or more information with decreasing returns,
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   because they're trying desperately to intuit
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.480]   what will make you buy something.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.680]   And we are actually learning that all the things that
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.760]   work the first time don't work anymore.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.720]   And that's a bit that's massastarized.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.200]   And this is why there's the backlash,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.960]   because there is this notion that the more information you
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.040]   have about the end-user, the more precisely you can target them.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.520]   And actually, that's been a bit dubious for a long time.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.840]   And the challenge was advertising was always a let's guess,
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.160]   let's try and subdivide the audience to different people
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.040]   and so advertising to that targeted group.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.320]   That's how magazines and newspapers
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.880]   got away with charging high ad rates for a long time,
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.440]   because they were saying, well, we've
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.160]   got a great audience full of rich people doing this kind of thing,
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.800]   and therefore you should advertise to those.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.480]   And again, that works if you're like, I have a brand,
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.680]   but it's only valuable to this set of people.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.880]   But the notion of the micro-dogging, I think,
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:27.080]   has been less effective than that.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.240]   Doc has also written a blog post called
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.440]   Apple's Content Blocking is chemo for the cancer of ad tech.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.640]   So we know--
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.680]   We know on which side he sits.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.520]   Matt, you might agree with that, actually.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.280]   What does that mean?
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.640]   Well, I just got brave.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   So--
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.920]   Hold on, Matt.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   Matt, sorry.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.040]   I was just going to say that I love contributor.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.240]   I love Patreon.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.000]   And I saw that Patreon raised money this week.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.960]   And it's just--
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:54.960]   Oh, great.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.440]   That's great.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.880]   If you can have Patreon supported enterprise,
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.560]   then you've got support from the people
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.440]   that you love, your thousand fans.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.160]   And it's exactly the kind of thing where everybody's happy.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.600]   And so what you were saying, you see more and more sites
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.080]   using Google contributor, I see that as well.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.200]   And I'm very happy about that.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.400]   And I just kind of hope if we could get to an inflection
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.080]   point where enough people know about it
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.320]   and enough publishers use it, why wouldn't you
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.240]   try that as a business model for a publisher?
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.960]   It's just extra money and lets people support the sort
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.240]   of sites that they love.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.880]   One of the things Google contributor lets you do
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.160]   is replace ads with the image of your choice.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.240]   And I decided to put kittens on pages.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.440]   And I have now many, many pages with cats.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.120]   So I had Jack Conney come to an event at CUNY,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.280]   a small work group of public video.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.800]   We could what a star he is.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.200]   He's just a big--
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.360]   God, he's even bigger.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.200]   His story is great, too, because he and his, I think,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.400]   wife, Natalie, have had a musical group called Pomp the Most.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.000]   They still do.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.480]   And they put a lot of heart and soul and sweat
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.000]   into YouTube videos that would get millions of views
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.880]   and a few thousand bucks.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.400]   And it didn't make up for the cost or the effort they put into it.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.200]   And he said, there's got to be a better way in founded
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.960]   Patreon, scratched his own itch, and has really
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.760]   empowered a lot of people, including many podcasters,
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.960]   to do that.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.240]   It's one root, but it is kind of a pure root.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.000]   It's a nice root.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.440]   I like it.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.000]   I agree with it.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.960]   Let's go back to Apple for one second if we could.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.720]   I think we might have missed this story.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.960]   I think it's critical.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.400]   Apple killed its ad service, fired its ad staff.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.280]   And what's key about this is--
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.680]   and I've said this for some time--
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.720]   Apple failed at advertising.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.680]   And thus, Apple is now motivated to pull the rug out
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.000]   from everyone else who depends on advertising.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.800]   So watch for Apple to get more and more
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.720]   hostile to advertising on mobile, which is where everything
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.960]   is going to go.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.640]   And it's going to be more--
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.360]   I'll bet they're going to make ad blockers defaulted.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.240]   And they're just going to say, the publishers.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.720]   They're making a virtue out of an necessity.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.640]   Because I think the truth is I had failed.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.040]   And they were putting too many restrictions on advertisers.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:15.960]   It was too much work.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.200]   There were a lot of reasons.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.320]   It was the little banner ads you see in apps and things
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.880]   like that, oftentimes, a full page takeover in apps.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.480]   So they're shutting it down.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.040]   But what they're doing is, I agree with you, Jeff,
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.560]   is going to double down on this.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.840]   Oh, but we're all for user privacy.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.360]   And obviously, running an ad network
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.480]   is kind of counter to that notion.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.800]   So I think you're going to sum up the notes
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.760]   or other bodily orifice of Google.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.680]   It's the way Apple can fight Google.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.560]   I don't think it's-- you need not say a thumb up the nose.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.880]   It merely a way to position themselves as the privacy company.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.280]   I know.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.120]   I think they can actively hurt Google.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.760]   I'd be very careful about thumbing Google's nose,
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.400]   as Microsoft has learned to its detriment, I think.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.840]   Now, after the Gmail-- after the Gmail man ads--
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.560]   Put them in an awkward position.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.040]   It was interesting to me that Microsoft, for a while,
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.160]   an internet explorer was proposing
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.320]   blocking any third party thing that was included
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.680]   for more than three sites, which would
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.880]   have the net effect of blocking all analytics
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.000]   and a ton of different ad things.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And so Microsoft pulled back from that
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.680]   based on what a lot of people said.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.720]   But it seems like Apple, to Jeff's point,
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:32.280]   has at least enabled that or a couple steps of indirection
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:32.960]   enabled that.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.520]   And what's also interesting to me is people love Patreon,
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.160]   which takes, I think, 5% cut.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.760]   And people sort of chafe at maybe Apple
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.680]   taking a 30% cut of purchases.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.600]   And so it's interesting to think about that spectrum of like,
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.320]   where does the love start?
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.880]   And where does it become a legislative transaction?
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.400]   People love CD Baby and those kinds of businesses.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:58.080]   And maybe it's just that it's a small percentage, I'm not sure.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.520]   Kevin?
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.120]   Well, I think that's right.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.920]   I think there is a transition here from what
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.320]   you can support with what.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.680]   Because part of what we've learned from Patreon and Kickstarter
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.800]   and other systems like that is that actually people
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.600]   are willing to pay for things.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.920]   But they're willing to pay different amounts of money
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.760]   for different things.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.760]   And that depends on how much they like the thing
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.520]   and how much disposable income they have.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.360]   Whereas--
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.960]   And they're not absolutely paying.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.040]   Sorry.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.280]   So can I put a fish?
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:27.760]   Sorry.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.000]   Whereas advertising assumes that nobody
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.480]   wants to pay very much and commoditizes them all down
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:38.800]   to a uniform amount per person and spreads it out over that.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.680]   So in effect, it only actually does
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.720]   work if you have millions of people watching.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.160]   Whereas Patreon, Kickstarter, and other things of that elk
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.720]   can work if you have thousands of people watching
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.840]   if they care enough.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.920]   And I think that's an interesting transformation
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.600]   of the media scene.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.400]   One that hasn't fully sunk in yet.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.240]   All I was going to say, sorry for the lag here.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.320]   Paying for is a critical phrase here.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.520]   Because they're not paying for access on Patreon, really.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.640]   They're paying to support.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.040]   Yeah, because if you don't contribute,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.320]   you get the podcast or the music or whatever.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.000]   Right.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.480]   Right.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.000]   Yes.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.440]   So that's an--
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.760]   I think--
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.000]   --supporting versus paying to get.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.080]   And by the way, it's very limited what you can do with that.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.840]   I'll be honest with you, because we tried to do that
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.200]   for several years at the beginning.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.880]   Now, of course, we didn't have the infrastructure of Patreon.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.200]   But there was no way I could have built
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.880]   Twit without advertising.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.800]   Right.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.520]   There's just nobody was going to give enough money
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.360]   to do what we've done.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.640]   Even when we sold bricks to build the studio,
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.920]   as many as we sold, we sold 1,800 bricks,
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.600]   it only went about a quarter of the way
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.680]   toward building a studio.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.920]   Right.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   But you are on the other end of that spectrum,
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.640]   in that you do have--
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.720]   you're in the millions--
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.440]   I agree.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.840]   But if you want to have that spectrum,
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.680]   you have to have a spectrum of monetization options.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:08.400]   If you want everything to be small and user--
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.760]   the patronage system is a great system.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.640]   But there's only a few Michelangelo's that can be--
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.120]   and I think even fewer Medicis.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.080]   But there's even fewer New York Timeses, is the point.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.920]   I think if you frame it that way around,
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.280]   you've got it slightly backwards,
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.360]   in that there are many people who
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.480]   could have their artistic work--
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.000]   Right.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.560]   We want many, many, many, many.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.160]   That's right.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.000]   That's right.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.840]   Whereas there is this sort of--
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.200]   There should be only one Twit.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:42.120]   Thank you.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.600]   One note, but there is this--
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.560]   I went to the Social Computing Supposed
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.760]   in New York last week, and one of the sessions there was TV people
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.680]   talking about how they use social media.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.120]   And it was fascinating to hear their point of view on it,
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.360]   which is that their point of view is that TV is a wonderful thing
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.760]   because it enables us to do these large-scale things.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.520]   And it's like, well, it enables you to do those large-scale things.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.080]   But to say that the net doesn't enable that
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.960]   is to miss the point that it enables a gigantic range of things
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   that TV cuts off.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.320]   Which we love.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.680]   And it's very hard for those two mindsets to meet.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.680]   Because if you are successful in big media,
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.480]   it's difficult to take the kind of leap that you took Leo
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.000]   and say, OK, I can do this myself on my own time
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.640]   and on my own skill.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.920]   It's not a trivial thing to do.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.880]   And it's actually very hard.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.360]   And it's easier for them to say what we need
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.200]   is to find the people who are doing something
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.080]   in this trivial net media over here
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.800]   and make them into TV stars.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.720]   And that's the mindset you get.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.760]   Basically, basically, the original Max Hedgerman movie,
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.280]   20% of the year.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.160]   You actually are Max Hedgerman right now, which is kind of--
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.720]   This is just kind of--
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:58.120]   --have an amazing, amazing kind of juxtaposition.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.120]   We have a great panel.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.960]   And we're going to put up with some of the bandwidth issues.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.160]   Jeff Jarvis, of course, is in Switzerland at Davos
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.600]   at the World Economic Forum.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.000]   Actually, his bandwidth's not too bad.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.160]   He's doing all right.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.120]   It's Kevin March in the heart of Silicon Valley
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.840]   who's having the most trouble.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.480]   It's a couple of children here.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.560]   It tells you something, doesn't it?
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.280]   It's a Google 5 and it gets to my house.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.360]   Also with this Matt Cutz who has--
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.520]   Do you have Google Fiber in your home?
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.320]   I wish-- I want to think you did.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:25.680]   I know.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.560]   I want to believe you do that.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.400]   I would pay so much for Google Fiber.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:29.920]   What?
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.880]   You just can't get it.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.800]   Oh, I can't get it.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.640]   Even if you work for the big G or the big A,
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.040]   do you work for A or G?
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:38.800]   I work for G.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.040]   OK.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.600]   Not for A.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   Not for A.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.400]   Not for A.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.000]   G and A.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.560]   G and A.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.680]   I could go somewhere with that, but I'm not.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.240]   Our show today brought to you by those good folks
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.000]   at FreshBooks.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.640]   One of the things that we try to do with our advertisers
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.080]   is instead of imposing them upon you
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.040]   is more like an introduction.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.000]   I always think of it as kind of--
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.880]   we look for advertisers that match our ethics, our interests,
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.840]   that offer a product that we think our audience would be
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.640]   interested in, and then we make the introduction.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.840]   So I would like to introduce you to my good friend, FreshBooks.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.320]   I happen to know FreshBooks pretty well,
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.200]   because it saved my life when I was a freelancer.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.360]   About 10 years ago, I hated-- and I'm sure you do too,
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.760]   if you're in the freelancer or your small business--
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.880]   I hated the end of the month, because that meant, oh, now
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.920]   it's time to go fire up Microsoft Word
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.400]   and start doing the invoices.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.880]   And by the way, you might as well fire up Excel, too,
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.800]   because I'm invoicing people in the different currencies.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.000]   And oh, yeah, I got to do time and hours.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.880]   I got to get all those receipts out of the shoe bucket.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.920]   By the end of that, it was like, I'll do it next month.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.480]   And that problem with doing it next month, unfortunately,
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.840]   is-- that means you don't get paid the next month.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.880]   Or the month after, or the month after.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.040]   After whining about this for a while,
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.200]   Amber MacArthur told me, I have some friends
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.760]   who've started this thing called FreshBooks.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.120]   You really ought to check it out.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.640]   No, she was right.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.040]   Since then, more than 5 million people have used FreshBooks.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.560]   They love it, and you will, too.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.000]   You know more putting invoices together in Word.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.440]   You just set up these professional looking invoices.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.520]   It's easy when it comes invoice time
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.920]   to import your receipts from the FreshBooks app.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.480]   You just take a picture of the receipt.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.880]   Your time and hours, too, the app will track those.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.240]   It's just a super simple cloud accounting solution
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:39.360]   that really helps you save time billing and get paid faster.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.200]   Plus, they've announced some nice new features.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.640]   They really are expanding.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.600]   They have a card reader.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.640]   So it turns out a number of FreshBooks customers
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.240]   are people who go to houses like contractors and plumbers,
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.480]   building inspectors.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.680]   They go to houses.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.720]   They do some work.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.440]   Maybe they present an estimate.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.360]   Do some work, present an invoice.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.000]   FreshBooks is just going to totally--
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.120]   you can send an estimate right after the handshake
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.200]   from the FreshBooks iPhone app.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.960]   You can send an invoice right after you do the work.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.280]   And then they've got a FreshBooks card reader.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.160]   You plug into the iPhone.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.960]   It's EMV enabled so you can swipe the stripe or dip the chip.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.480]   Take your payment, and you're on your way.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.520]   It is heaven.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.600]   You're going to love FreshBooks.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.120]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.320]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.920]   FreshBooks.com/twig, T-W-I-G.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.920]   And don't forget to use-- to tell them,
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.080]   I heard it on This Week in Google.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.880]   They'll ask you at some point, I think.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.560]   Start your 30-day free trial today.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.160]   And we thank them for supporting this episode of This Week
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:48.480]   in Google FreshBooks.com/twig.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:48.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.000]   I can't resist twisting the dagger a little bit.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.200]   I see that Gawker is selling a stake to an investment company
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.440]   to raise money.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.760]   They say, for two reasons, to partly
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.160]   to fund expansions into video and e-commerce,
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.240]   but mostly girding ourselves for Hulk Hogan's lawsuit.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.280]   Oh.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.160]   100 million dollar lawsuit.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.080]   Gawker obtained a video that showed him-- well,
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.120]   I don't even want to say.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.280]   It was really appalling.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.440]   And they're at a polling company.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.320]   And I just can't wait to watch them
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.040]   spend all that money in court.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.600]   I had to twist the tag just a little bit.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.640]   Hey, another thing, as long as I'm getting personal here,
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.520]   I'm trying to buy a Tesla X. That's the one with this.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.680]   This company has the worst customer service
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.320]   I have ever experienced in my life.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.280]   You're kidding me.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.040]   I thought they were supposed to be the new--
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.120]   So first of all, you pay them $5,000
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.000]   just to get on the waiting list, right?
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.800]   That's just to get on the waiting list.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.960]   So I got the email last week saying, OK, congratulations.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.720]   Thanks for the $5,000 six months ago.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.760]   We've really enjoyed the float.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.080]   Now, it's time for you to design your Tesla.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:06.560]   Wait for this.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.160]   So I went online and I picked a color.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.400]   And then I'm looking in vain for a delivery date or whatever.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.120]   They say, you have one week to change your design
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.280]   as of Saturday, this coming Saturday.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.240]   You're committed, baby.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.920]   And you can't back out of this because we've already
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.720]   started to make it.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.880]   I mean, they're really like--
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.880]   Oh, oh.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.160]   So I thought, well, I would really like to test drive this.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.240]   Look at the color I chose just kind of--
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.360]   so I called Tesla.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.440]   And I got a guy in charge of sales.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.120]   He's in free money.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.000]   He's at the factory, I presume.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.760]   He sounded like he just woke up from a nap to be perfectly frank.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.480]   And I said, a couple of things.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.160]   I'd like to test drive.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.200]   He said, no, I know you can't do that.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:44.640]   I understand.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.240]   All right, I understand it's a new car.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.800]   They haven't been making money with a door so go like that.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.160]   Can I see a paint chip or anything?
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.640]   No, I don't think so.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.880]   I said, well, here's the real thing.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.520]   My lease doesn't run out until September.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.240]   I'd like to kind of arrange it so they don't get the Tesla
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.120]   till my lease.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.400]   You're around when my lease-- I'll pay an extra month or whatever.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.000]   But I want to get in that time frame.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.880]   Can you tell me-- it's supposed to tell me on the page,
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.520]   but I don't see it anywhere when I'll get it.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.120]   He says, no, I don't know.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.320]   I said, I said, is there--
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.840]   I said, you mean-- because you understand,
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.680]   I'm trying to figure out if this Tesla will arrive like in a week,
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.600]   in a month, in six months, in a year, is-- can you give me it?
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.160]   No.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:33.440]   I said, is there anyone there who knows?
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:38.080]   He said, I could write an email for you.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.120]   I said, well, can't get the start.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.040]   Said an email.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:42.520]   That's good.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   He said, OK, well, let me write an email.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.240]   So you're going out of the country.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.360]   Is that the problem?
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.640]   I said, no, I'm not going out of the country.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.160]   I just told you I just have a lease.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.880]   Dave's not here, man.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.320]   What's your name again?
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.200]   No, he has my name.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.240]   I said, do you have my name?
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.120]   He said, oh, yeah, I have it all in front of me.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.720]   I guess they look up the phone number.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.480]   He knows everything.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.600]   He knows exactly what I'm ordering and everything.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.800]   So they got that part down.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.360]   So somebody will call you.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.880]   So this is three or four days ago.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.880]   I haven't heard from anybody.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.400]   So now I don't know what to do.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.840]   Because Saturday I'm in and they could arrive next week
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.920]   or could arrive next year or could--
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.960]   And you can't cancel.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:24.960]   No.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.520]   Oh.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.040]   Oh.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:32.640]   And by the way, I just saw that they're
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.880]   suing a German company because apparently the doors that
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.520]   do this don't do that.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.600]   So they have a--
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   So I have to decide between now and Saturday.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.360]   I'm like, I'm in a Jeff Jarvis funk.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.480]   Tesla turns out to be the new Verizon.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.440]   Hey, who knew?
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.680]   So now I have to figure out, should I cancel this?
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.480]   But I really want it.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.000]   But I don't know.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.720]   And in fact, it could come--
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.040]   it might-- I don't know.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.680]   I think I can get my 5,000 back.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.440]   I don't really know.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.560]   They don't say anything about that.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.560]   Oh, I think that.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.560]   They're not here, man.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.600]   I saw an Audi-- an international Audi executive
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.920]   at an event in Munich.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.280]   And I couldn't help myself.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.960]   He said, I got a boat to pick with you.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.440]   You know what he's fearing.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.400]   You know what he's fearing.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.800]   When's all Android on him?
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.840]   I want Android on him.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.880]   Dork.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.400]   American Dork.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.280]   I think part of this is just you're buying a car
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.880]   that they never made.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.440]   I mean, they're just making them.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:29.960]   So--
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.600]   Yeah, would you buy an Apple product for the first time?
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.040]   You never write.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:33.560]   You've said that.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.120]   You want it for it.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.120]   I shouldn't buy it.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.520]   It's crazy.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.640]   But they have made some.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.160]   But I said, can I test drive it?
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.120]   No, we don't have many.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.520]   What do you think, Matt?
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.840]   You're a europe.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.760]   You're like me.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.120]   Yes, I was in a similar situation.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.480]   I actually put a down payment down on a Tesla
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:53.360]   when it was the Model S.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:53.840]   I had a feeling.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.640]   And I eventually pulled it back.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.800]   Because there was just too many.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.640]   I was like, you can always buy it a little later.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.520]   There's always time.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.960]   I'm sure if I were buying an S now,
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.680]   I could at least test drive it and look at a paint chip.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.180]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.320]   You know, I'm sure that's much more
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.480]   like the normal car experience.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:11.320]   But I just wanted to tell people.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.640]   It's weird that you can't see the colors
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.160]   because you'd think they'd have the same colors
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.720]   on the Model S as on the X.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.160]   You can see it on the web.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:18.840]   But I don't know.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.760]   I'll let it web.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.040]   As you know, you don't know what that color really
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:22.680]   is going to look like.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.600]   It's called titanium.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.440]   It looks like bronze.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.440]   I don't know what it is.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.040]   Well, there are Tesla showrooms.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.360]   Yeah, but there are no Xs in the showrooms.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:31.920]   Right.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.520]   And you know what?
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:32.960]   I don't know.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.320]   This guy, he just woke up from a nap.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.480]   Maybe I could go see a Model S in that color.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.440]   I don't know.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.440]   He just said no.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.440]   No.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.480]   That doesn't work.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.680]   I'll decide by Friday whether to cancel it or not.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.120]   But the test drive was not a great experience.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.080]   Oh, interesting.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.120]   See?
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:53.680]   Really?
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   See, that's why I want to test drive it.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.440]   I do have a ton of friends who love their tests.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:57.960]   I know.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.280]   That's the other side of it.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.520]   So everybody I know says, oh, I love it.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.520]   I love it.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.880]   It's a good problem to have.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.640]   Like, hmm, what delightful new cars do I have?
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.040]   Well, my least friends at--
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.640]   --September and I just have to decide.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:21.360]   And like you, Jeff, I'd love to have Android Auto and Apple
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.280]   CarPlay.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.600]   But now the Tesla doesn't have that.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.560]   So I'm thinking maybe now I should just get a Ford
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.360]   and just do the right.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.400]   Just be smart.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.920]   Just get a Ford.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.720]   You can't go wrong with a Ford.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.560]   What Ford would you get?
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.600]   I don't know.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.800]   Plug in Hybrid, probably.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.080]   I mean, I got solar panels and I ordered a Powerwall
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.880]   because I thought I was getting a Tesla, but--
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.080]   Oh.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.720]   This is ending up to be like a ridiculously expensive savings.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.080]   Well, that's your life.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.360]   Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.760]   By the way, I'm sorry.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.920]   Jack Dorsey is no longer a billionaire.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.280]   Pity.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.360]   I figure he's not alone.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.040]   The stock market really tanked today.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.160]   Oh, what do you mean today?
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.160]   It's been a week of taking--
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.000]   --of taking--
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.400]   --shares on Twitter along with every other and square
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:17.360]   and every other tech company plummeted again today.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.440]   So his wealth, which was once $2 billion
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:25.360]   before Square Web Public, he's only worth $944.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.600]   Oh, I'm sorry, $944 million.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.560]   That just jumped up with--
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.000]   There's a big difference.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.920]   But he's no longer a member of the Trace Comers Club.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   He's not in the three-comer club, the Trace Comers Club.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.800]   But didn't he also give like $200 million or $300 million
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.600]   of his Twitter stock to the employees?
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.120]   Is that not awesome?
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.160]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.840]   I mean, you got to give extra points for that.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   That's--
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.520]   That's pretty cool.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.800]   I mean, that is really impressive.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.680]   And obviously, when you have $944 million,
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.520]   you're not really counting the comments.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.640]   Maybe you are, I don't know.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.800]   He has a card with doors that go like this.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.640]   Doors that go like that.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.840]   A little Silicon Valley reference.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:04.720]   When's that coming back?
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:05.960]   Hey, let me ask you, Matt Cutts,
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.680]   do the guys at Google watch that and laugh
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.920]   and say hooly.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.600]   Yeah, I mean, it's a fantastic show.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.840]   It's so inside.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.800]   And in fact--
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.080]   Yeah, thanks to Dan Lyons, I think.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.960]   It's really a show that probably is better appreciated
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:25.520]   in Silicon Valley than outside of it.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.960]   I saw Dan a few days ago, music.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.360]   Really?
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:29.960]   How's he doing?
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.000]   Is he still writing for--
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.360]   I didn't talk about doing stuff for a minute, yeah?
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.080]   He's got a book coming out.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.600]   Yeah, that's controversial.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.080]   Not for him, but for the people.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.200]   Do you think it's a tell-all kind of--
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.520]   It's about HubSpot.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.120]   Remember somebody got fired for trying
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.080]   to get the copy of his "Mosel" or some such thing?
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.680]   I can't remember what the story was.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:56.880]   So Dan Lyons is a really fascinating story.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.760]   He was the fake Steve Jobs.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.000]   He was writing at Newsweek when he was doing that.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.840]   Or time, some journal.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.720]   There's definitely a game.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.240]   And no one knew who the fake Steve Jobs blog was written by,
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.600]   but everybody read it, loved it.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.360]   It was hysterical.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.240]   Turned out, it was him.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.880]   He's got this great Boston accent too,
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.080]   so I hear him reading it.
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:21.000]   So for some reason, then he moved to HubSpot,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.400]   which was like a social--
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.440]   I don't know what it was.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.200]   It was a social network.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.280]   It's content marketing.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.160]   Basically, they call it inbound marketing.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:34.120]   So the point is it's using social media stuff
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.720]   to bring you clients in a sensible way,
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.600]   rather than spam your advertising way.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:38.600]   That's their broad pitch.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:43.280]   So they've got a bunch of tools for helping you
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.440]   make sense of explaining your stuff online
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.560]   to social media and things.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.480]   So he left--
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.520]   No, no, no, no, not quite sure how he fit in there.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.920]   And I don't think he was sure either.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.680]   No, he was.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:56.280]   And I remember meeting him at the Moto X event at Google.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.760]   And he was like, I don't know what I'm doing here.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.480]   But anyway.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.120]   And I love him.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.360]   I really like Dan.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.960]   And then, although others in the industry are not,
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.240]   I know a certain well-known tech journalist who
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.880]   says I will not be in the same room with Dan Lyons, which
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:13.120]   makes it all the more interesting.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.520]   Anyway, so Dan then left and was editor of Gawker
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.560]   for one week.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.160]   Literally.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.200]   ValleyWag.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:21.920]   ValleyWag.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.560]   ValleyWag, yeah.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.280]   For one week.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.920]   And then said, oh, I screwed it.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.880]   I'm going to write a book.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:32.800]   And now he's working-- he's one of the writers
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.560]   at Silicon Valley.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.800]   But he did write the book.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.960]   And it's apparently a tell-all about HubSpot, right?
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.200]   I think that's right.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.040]   Yeah, some HubSpot people got in trouble
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.720]   for trying to steal the manuscripts.
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.360]   Kind of interesting.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.160]   But where is it?
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.520]   He spat the IPO of HubSpot, didn't he?
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.040]   So he joined them, and then they went public.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.160]   Awesome.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.240]   That was a good move.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.680]   Well, his first book--
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:02.920]   Now Steve's taking jobs.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.240]   It was really funny.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.320]   So hopefully the second one will be really good, too.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.200]   He's a muckraker, a scathing memoir.
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.280]   He's described his memoir about his stint at HubSpot,
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:16.280]   a scathing, scathing.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.560]   He does there some--
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:21.800]   The Office vibe was "Frathouse meets cult compound,"
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.880]   according to the publisher.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.320]   "Shower pods became hookup dens.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.640]   Nerf gunfights broke out at lunch.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:32.320]   An absent boss is specialized in cryptic jargon-filled emails."
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:37.600]   Matt, you're smiling.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.120]   Well, I think we ought to send Dan Lyons to a bunch
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.400]   of different companies to protect.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.720]   I think a lot of this stuff happens.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.440]   Sounds like Silicon Valley.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.720]   So let him wait around in there and bring back what he finds.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.520]   I think that's pretty awesome.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.760]   I have to stand corrected.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.920]   It was not literally one week at Valley Wagg.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:56:00.360]   It was six, literally a month and a half.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.520]   Gentlemen, is it time to go to bed?
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.920]   Yes, it is.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.640]   I left the hotel room at 6.30 this morning.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.920]   I haven't been back.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.400]   Aw.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.760]   You're not going to go to the parties?
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.120]   Come on, you know you're going to stop off.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:15.120]   No, I probably actually need to stop by one of them.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:15.520]   Say hi.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.800]   Or to the piano part night.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.640]   Who are you going to look for?
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.960]   I don't know.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.200]   Kevin Spacy.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:23.960]   Yes, either?
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:24.880]   Yes.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:25.520]   Yes, he's there.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.760]   Tell him hi for me.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:28.280]   We'll do.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:28.800]   No, he knows me.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.200]   We'll do.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.440]   He knows who I am.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.440]   We've had words.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.280]   That's right.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:36.480]   I had dinner.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.400]   It was one of these program leaders that I had dinner
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.720]   about tonight with John Green, who's great vlogbrothers
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.360]   and VidCon and all that.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:48.360]   He was just delightful, just a nice, nice guy.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.480]   And my daughter, having seen that John Green was saying
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.200]   he was in Davos for the first time,
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.440]   she was impressed when I was here.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.760]   You're the same thing with John Green?
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.840]   Whoa, dude.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.000]   He's a YouTube star.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.920]   But he was nice enough to--
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.280]   he took my phone from me when I showed up at the email.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.920]   And he sent an email back to her immediately,
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.520]   which was nice up.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:12.480]   All right, we're all going to sing you a lullaby, Jeff.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.800]   And then, would you leave your headset for Kevin Marks?
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.120]   Because yours is working so much better.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.560]   Let me see what the headset is.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:19.920]   I don't know.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.600]   It's bandwidth.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.400]   I think your bandwidth is dying.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.240]   It's not easy.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.840]   Just now, my bandwidth started going.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.960]   OK.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.080]   Jeff Jarvis, ladies and gentlemen, you'll
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.640]   find him at buzzmachine.com.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.920]   His Tales of Davos will be coming out.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.720]   And I hope I'm supposed to fly back Sunday,
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:37.000]   but now there's a huge Blizzard headed to New York.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.600]   Snowpocalypse, too.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.800]   When I'm getting back.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   The quickening.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.400]   We'll see.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.080]   Yep.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:44.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.800]   All right, well, we hope we'll see you next week on this weekend.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.960]   It may be Missouri.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.080]   Yeah, from Zurich.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:49.800]   Good night.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:50.960]   I could think of better reasons.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   No better, no better reason.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.800]   I want to be helpful.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:54.720]   I want to be helpful.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.360]   All right, we'll go to bed then.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:56.840]   Thanks.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.280]   Good night.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.320]   Buzzmachine.com, Geek's Sparing News,
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.360]   Geek's Sparing Gifts, all about the news industry.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.440]   And all sorts of other great stuff.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.120]   Public parts.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.000]   What would Google do?
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.360]   Jeff Jarvis, everybody.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:12.040]   We love our Jeff.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.120]   Also with us, it's great to have Matt Cutz from Google.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.560]   But he's not representing Google.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.360]   He's here representing himself and his beard.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.600]   Is there a Twitter account?
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.640]   Matt Cutz beard yet?
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.160]   No.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.480]   We'll be soon.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.640]   Almost got to you.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.760]   Also, Kevin Marks from his own walled garden.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:35.800]   Thank God, anyway.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.480]   And some beautiful citrus trees in the background there.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.360]   KevinMarkz.com.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.720]   And of course, we'll find out more about the indie web--
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.840]   indiewebcamp.com.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:49.160]   Kevin's a big proponent of free and open web protocols.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.040]   If you are not yet a subscriber to our Twitter newsletter,
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.760]   good news, you can be a charter subscriber.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.280]   You can get the very first newsletter which goes out Sunday.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.040]   If you go to twitter.tv/newsletter and subscribe,
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:01.960]   it's double opt-in.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.760]   So we're not going to opt you in.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:06.280]   You've got to send an email and click a link.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.160]   It will send you an email.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:07.680]   You click a link.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.840]   What is that?
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.760]   Some words just flew in.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.120]   Were those left off the newsletter?
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.320]   Now they flew right off the lower third.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.120]   I've never seen that happen.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:22.680]   The escaped Twitter.tv/newsletter is the place
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:23.640]   if you'd like to get our newsletter.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.040]   And I will be writing little blurbs in there and others.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.720]   It'll be mostly a look at what's ahead in the week
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.800]   on the network.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:35.600]   Twitter.tv/newsletter.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.400]   So we tie those letters down.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.960]   Our show today brought to you by Scowers.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:44.760]   So base the place to make your next website, your blog,
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.480]   your portfolio, if you're an artist or photographer.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.720]   If you're a restaurant, put your menu up there.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.800]   If you're a business and you don't have a website,
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.920]   this is a great solution.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:53.680]   It's easy.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.720]   It's inexpensive.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.000]   It's fast.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.200]   You don't have to be an expert in web technologies.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.840]   They've got it all set up for you.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.120]   Everything from mobile responsive design to e-commerce
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.680]   built into every single template.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.600]   And when it comes to e-commerce, what's really nice
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.440]   about Squarespaces?
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.480]   Instead of somebody tries to buy something,
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.560]   let's hear a band.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.080]   You're selling your music.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.120]   Instead of pushing you off to some shopping cart
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.640]   on some other site that doesn't look anything
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.240]   like what you'd like it to look, your e-commerce
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.440]   lives on your page.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.760]   And it looks like your page.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.520]   It's got the design.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.800]   And I think that's really nice.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.680]   It's the only platform, let's you create, manage and brand
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.880]   your store beautifully.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.040]   They have a basic plan and an advanced plan
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.360]   with features for your growing business.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.120]   You'll also get a free domain name
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.160]   when you have a subscriber for a year, which is really great.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.520]   Best hosting, best software makes the best website.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.200]   And if you want to get geeky, not only are there
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.400]   unlimited settings for fonts, colors, page configurations,
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.560]   they allow you to use all the Google typefaces, all of that.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:57.720]   But they even have a developer platform
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.400]   that lets you really dig into the nitty gritty,
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.560]   create your own template if you want.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.640]   I love Squarespace.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:06.920]   I use the cover page at leoville.com as a way
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.200]   to introduce myself.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.880]   I use the blog, the portfolio.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:12.720]   It's a little slideshow at leoville.com.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:13.520]   You can check that out.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.680]   And what's fun is to-- there you go.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.720]   There's Jeff and Gina from Google I/O.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.400]   It even animated GIFs are supported.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.480]   Squarespace.com-- I'll tell you what, it's free to try.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.360]   But if you decide to buy-- and I think you will--
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.040]   use the promo code TWIG and you'll get 10% off--
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.440]   TWIG, the promo code, Squarespace.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.720]   You should.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.520]   You should.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.680]   Kevin Marks is here.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.520]   Matt Cutz is here.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.680]   We're talking about Google.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.280]   We're talking about Facebook.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.880]   Interesting article and fortune today about Facebook's
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.080]   walled garden.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.840]   Some publishers, perhaps not so excited.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.960]   AOL is teaming up with Microsoft and Verizon
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.880]   to say, we want to control distribution.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.320]   And the founder and CEO of New York-based Tabula,
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.120]   interestingly enough.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.120]   I can eat multiple mentions in this episode.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.760]   It is the Tabula show.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.040]   He says, I'm scared of a future where Facebook's getting 80%
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.120]   of your business.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:20.600]   That's true.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.420]   But I'm also scared of a future where there's
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:25.000]   Tabula on every page.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.760]   Tabula, by the way, is not the fine thing called Tabuli,
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.560]   which is a lovely salad dish made of-- what is it?
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.240]   Wheat Groats, what's in Tabuli?
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.680]   Something odd, but it's delicious.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.240]   Tabula and AOL have announced a three-year partnership.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.160]   What, by the way, what is--
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.960]   did you see the story that AOL may want to rebrand itself?
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.480]   What would happen to your SEO if you
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.880]   changed the name of your company that's been like the one--
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.840]   And yet, at the same time, America Online
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.880]   does sound a little bit like a CD in the mail
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.880]   for a dial-up service.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.400]   I think they have a problem.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.880]   We'll see what happens.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.320]   We'll see what happens.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.840]   AOL is now tech crunching.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.640]   Gadget, the Huffington Post, is much more of a content.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.720]   Play than anything else, but I don't know what name you could
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.040]   pick that would--
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.560]   I just-- I don't know how you could do that.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.240]   You're kind of stuck with it.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:24.360]   Somebody said AOL, LOL, LOL, or something.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.320]   AOL, LOL is good.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.400]   Bulger, by the way.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.480]   I like AOL.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.600]   Let me be perfectly clear.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.480]   I make a lot of the properties that they have.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.240]   But great.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.240]   Somebody tweeted that.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.080]   I spent a lot of time on AOL.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.960]   Bulger is the wheat product that is into Bully.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.480]   Bulger wheat.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:39.960]   OK.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.320]   Yeah, bulger wheat.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.560]   Did you see the article about Google Core update algorithm
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.720]   continues as SEOs notice weekend Google update?
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.760]   Yeah, let me ask you about Penguin, because I guess we're
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.960]   getting close to the new--
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.080]   Penguins and Algorithm, is that right?
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.040]   Penguin is an algorithm.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.920]   Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.800]   Our rule of thumb is never to announce stuff in the future
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.240]   because it could slip or for various other reasons.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.960]   We might want to go back and tweak things.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.560]   So I think folks at Google had been like, OK, Penguin is
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.720]   coming, and then the holidays came.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.720]   And they're like, well, let's hold off on Penguin for a
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.680]   little while longer.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.240]   And in general, around the holidays, Google doesn't want
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.960]   to create extra stress for publishers and webmasters and
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:23.480]   SEOs.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.240]   So we tend not to roll out a lot of algorithmic changes right
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.640]   in the middle of December.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.080]   But then what happens is if you freeze your code, then
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.280]   people keep working and come January 1, January 2, 3, 4,
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:36.920]   5.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.840]   People are like, OK, we get a launch everything.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.320]   Yay.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.800]   And so my suspicion, I don't know for sure, is that this
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.600]   particular change--
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.160]   I don't think that it was Penguin.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.360]   It was just there's a lot of stuff that's been building up
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.120]   in the pipeline.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.640]   And now the code freeze has been lifted and we're ready to
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.560]   start launching stuff.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.880]   And so you see a lot more changes, often right at the
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.080]   beginning of the year, because everything's been waiting
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.040]   to go out.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.280]   I love this article by Barry Schwartz in the search engine
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:02.840]   roundtable.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:06.160]   Google's Gary Elias shares confidential screenshot that
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.200]   reveals nothing.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.400]   Yeah, that was a little--
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.240]   Not mean.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.960]   So he says, Barry Schwartz, I heard you wanted pictures.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.080]   Here's one on my screen.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.840]   Yes, I do.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:18.480]   Thank you.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.600]   And Barry does something where every day he publishes a
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.800]   picture related to people with a search photo of the day.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.880]   So he was saying it's been slim pickings.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.160]   And so here you go.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   Here's a confidential--
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.320]   Maybe it's how long the videos are.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.040]   We have no idea.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.520]   We've had Barry on the show.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.240]   We love him.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.760]   And so Gary Elias is your colleague, I imagine.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.960]   Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.720]   Yeah, he along with John Mueller.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.240]   And there's actually several Webmaster Trends analysts do
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.560]   a fantastic job of letting people know about new things
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.560]   happening.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.720]   In addition to the Google Webmaster blog, they do Webmaster
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.680]   Hangouts, all sorts of great ways to help people.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.080]   So he kind of implied that Penguin was imminent.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.440]   Yeah, and I suspect it will be coming.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.920]   And I know the Web spam team has been thinking hard about,
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.880]   do you do it as a single kind of push, or do you do it so
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.080]   that it's continuously updating, like page rank,
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.600]   continuously updates?
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.960]   And so it tends to be, you do these things manually until
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.040]   you get a good handle on it.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.720]   And then after a while, you can figure out how to make it
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.520]   work continuously.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.000]   And Search Engine Land has a story that said that
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.200]   fluctuations.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.160]   What are fluctuations?
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.080]   Just ranking changes.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:35.560]   And that was not due to Penguin, but that was due to just
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.160]   updates to page rank to the core.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.720]   Would you please explain-- you know what?
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.240]   This is a great time.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.560]   And Kevin, you'll forgive me if I--
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.720]   you, I'm sure, know all of this.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.600]   I went through the induction of Google, so I probably
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.160]   did some of it.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.880]   And there's way more than anyone else.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.000]   So what are we talking here?
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.240]   Everybody knows page rank, named after Larry Page.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.560]   It's the very famous kind of algorithm that
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.400]   made the put Google on the map.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.720]   And in my limited understanding that the notion of page rank
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.920]   is you rank higher as long--
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.400]   it's kind of recursive as long as the more higher ranked
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.040]   pages link to you.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:15.720]   Yep.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.800]   And that's still an effect.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.520]   That's not changing.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:21.560]   Well, we still have a system called page rank over time.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:25.640]   Some of the underlying representations and how we run
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.240]   the algorithms have changed.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.040]   But the intuition is still the same.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.840]   The intuition is roughly, if you were surfing around on the web,
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:35.000]   what sort of pages would you be likely to end up on?
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.080]   It's basically a measure of reputation.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.880]   And so we compute page rank differently
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.440]   than we might have in the initial patent disclosures
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.600]   and the initial papers.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.880]   But the end result is still basically the same.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.800]   The highly reputable sites tend to have high page rank.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.800]   And the ones that are not very well known
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.400]   or don't have a lot of links tend to have lower page rank.
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.960]   But I remember in the early days talking to Larry,
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.800]   and I don't really understand what it meant.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.040]   But he said, I will look at the end of the line on this.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.000]   Like, I go to the end of the printout
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.880]   and look at it and tweak the algorithm.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.880]   I don't even know what that means.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.640]   Well, if you look at site sorted by page rank,
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.800]   you get to the very bottom.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.920]   And I'm guessing about what he's meaning.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.400]   But if you get to a site at the very bottom and you're like,
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.000]   well, I expect this to have pretty good page rank
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.040]   and it doesn't, then you might go back and repeat.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:25.520]   OK.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.840]   That's probably what he meant.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.280]   I always thought seeds and stems somehow involved.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.160]   But that's probably not it.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.040]   But it's kind of like the stuff that kind of--
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.720]   there's a triteus after all of the index works.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.360]   And why isn't this--
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.160]   why is this here?
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:41.880]   What is this doing?
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.560]   I mean, something has to be at the bottom, obviously.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.320]   And there's always more pages that we could crawl.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.360]   So you always have to make that to--
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.200]   There's always more.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.360]   So the algorithm is always being tweaked somewhat.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.440]   And then there are these named things like Penguin.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.200]   What is that?
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.320]   So Penguin is more targeted towards web spam.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.640]   Panda is more targeted towards quality.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.960]   Hummingbird is more doing weightings
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.880]   about overall queries.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.440]   So usually they don't give them names.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.720]   If it's something that people might really notice,
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.160]   then you'd be more likely to give an algorithm a name.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.480]   Because this is happening every day, probably, right?
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.440]   Like 500 changes launch every year.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:21.800]   Wow.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.680]   500 plus.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.880]   So several times a day.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:24.480]   Wow.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.280]   And that's why if you don't launch anything
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.000]   or don't launch any major changes in ranking
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.040]   right before the holidays, that's why all that would--
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:33.720]   It's accumulated.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.840]   --have more changes, exactly.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.160]   It's like a roll up.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.480]   It's like a hot fix roll up.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:41.760]   How does-- just out of curiosity.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.000]   So there's like a team of search engineers.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:45.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.640]   And some-- and then what-- there's a meeting saying,
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.520]   I'm thinking of changing the algorithm to do this.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.240]   Somebody proposes a change.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:53.740]   Yep.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:54.520]   And then in fact--
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.020]   Go ahead.
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.440]   Tell me how it works.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.280]   Well, yeah.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.480]   It works exactly the way you think it would work.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.680]   You've got smart people looking at search results
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.680]   and even looking at queries and when that failed.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.280]   And they come up with new ideas for how to improve things.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.440]   Once they have ideas, they test it out, sort of in a sandbox.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.800]   And then if that works, then they'll
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.640]   roll it out and testing more broadly,
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.360]   even on the live search results.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.880]   And then they take all of that to weekly eating.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.200]   Or sometimes it happens more than once a week, where they say,
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.080]   here's a change, here's what it affects,
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.880]   here's how many users are affected in each language.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.120]   And then they debate the relative variance of,
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.840]   does it make the system more complex?
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.880]   Now, one interesting thing is, they actually
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.240]   produced a video of one of these meetings.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.680]   And so you can go and find a 10-minute segment of people
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.280]   discussing an actual algorithmic change
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.480]   and whether to launch it or not.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:43.840]   So that is out there.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.120]   Those must be fascinating meetings, well.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.000]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.560]   So--
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.160]   But the other thing to take away from that,
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.840]   this also fascinating, is that they're
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.120]   continually running experiments.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.760]   Any time using Google, you may be
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.680]   part of multiple experiments at once.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.400]   And one of the smart things that they did
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.680]   was enabling that sort of facility,
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.760]   that meant that it wasn't a big change once a month.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.040]   But they were able to continuously roll
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.400]   different things in and out.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.720]   So this is the Quality Launch Review meeting.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.040]   It happens on Thursdays.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:23.040]   And in this case, they're talking about spelling.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.920]   Something to do with spelling.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.520]   Look at all these-- this is so cool.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.680]   There's Ahmed Seagal.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.080]   He's the head of all of search.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.200]   You know, there's--
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.800]   Well, I won't-- there's Paul and Tristan.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.360]   I won't identify him by listening.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.120]   What's nice is this video has pop-up video.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.280]   So it's kind of fun.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.360]   You can actually listen to it and--
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.800]   Is that chapping the white shit?
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.400]   Are you in that video?
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.080]   I would go to those meetings as well.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.280]   So they tried to figure out how to make these meetings
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.160]   interesting, because for a lot of people,
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.040]   they might consider it dull as dust.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.560]   For techies, it's pretty fascinating.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.120]   But it's--
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.120]   It looks like a UN conference.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.240]   I mean, it's really cool.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.680]   I mean, the little microphones.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.880]   You almost feel like there should
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.360]   be simultaneous translation going on.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.720]   It's a big deal.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.480]   They'll have engineers dialing in from Japan,
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.640]   all kinds of other places.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.840]   And then you've got people around the table
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.480]   who are experts who have really dug in.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.400]   You have a separate evaluation group.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.920]   And so they have evaluated each individual change.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.920]   And those people get--
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.840]   their voices get a lot of weight whenever you're
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.880]   deciding whether to launch them.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:32.040]   And you were there in your role as spam fighters
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.200]   to kind of just-- in case something
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.640]   has an impact on the work you do.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.280]   Yeah, or publishers, webmasters in general.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.960]   OK, so you represent the webmasters as well.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.320]   Now that was-- I've been out on leave,
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.000]   so I haven't been in these minutes for a while.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.880]   Well, I can tell you, your beer is considerably longer now.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.480]   Yes, that's--
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.960]   Incidentally?
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.480]   Just to make you happy, let's see what's going on with Matt
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.040]   cuts.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.800]   I'm trying to link to this.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.320]   I know.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:00.920]   Yes.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.520]   Yes.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.120]   Yes, it's happened.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.120]   Oh, no.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.800]   Oh.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.720]   What do we have?
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.520]   Oh.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520]   No.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.160]   I knew the minute I said that, it was all over.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:19.880]   Matt cuts--
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.840]   Matt cuts beard.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.680]   20 minutes.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.200]   That was fast.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.680]   So by the way, I also have another important thing
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:31.120]   to tell you.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.400]   Today is Penguin Awareness Day.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.200]   And now I admit, there's one of two big Penguin days.
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   April 25th is World Penguin Day.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:43.720]   Wow.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.520]   So you've got two important benchmarks here.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.200]   If you want to release Penguin--
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.400]   We should do it on those dates.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.400]   That would be hilarious.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.600]   Penguin Awareness Day.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.440]   I didn't want to be that aware of Penguin.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.320]   It is Penguin Awareness Day, everybody.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.680]   So it has a name.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.480]   It's a jocular name, obviously.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.920]   It doesn't have anything to do with the actual code.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.360]   It's not black and white or anything.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.880]   Penguin publishers have been posted on a gift all day.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.960]   Have they, really?
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.840]   Well, whenever we go to a search conference,
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.720]   they'll give us stuff penguins or stuff pandas.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.080]   Oh, how funny.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.640]   So it's kind of handy that it's not named by number
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.640]   or something like that.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.360]   I know you're not directly involved with it,
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.200]   but do you have some sense of what changes might
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.400]   happen with Penguin?
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.880]   Oh, Penguin actually came directly out of web spam.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.600]   Oh, so you are.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.080]   Oh, so you are.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.920]   Overall search quality.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.080]   Penguin came directly out of web spam.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.960]   All the SEOs are listening, Matt.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.920]   And so it tries to improve quality of content on the web.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.400]   Where have I heard that before?
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.920]   But the nice thing is there are people
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.760]   at Google who are always listening to feedback.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.400]   And--
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.120]   Well, we don't have to listen real hard,
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.400]   because if somebody's ranking goes from second to fifth,
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.240]   you're going to hear it.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.600]   You hear about it.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.840]   Absolutely.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.440]   Do they come to your home?
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.800]   OK, you don't have this-- no, no, no.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.760]   Don't say anything.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:18.240]   You'd be wise to avoid that conversation.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.760]   Anyway.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.120]   You're smiling at this event, though.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.680]   You're very happy.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.680]   You're having a good time.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.080]   I'm looking at the video.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:28.600]   Matt's--
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.240]   Oh, they've launched me.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:29.760]   Matt's rubbing.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:30.280]   That's just so much.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.320]   Go back a little bit, because--
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.480]   show the video, because not only is he smiling,
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.920]   but in a little bit, I think--
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.120]   I can imagine what's going through your head here,
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.680]   as he rubs his beard.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.200]   I wonder if I should--
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.440]   grow a beard, maybe.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.040]   I should-- I should grow a beard.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.600]   I wonder how I'd look with a beard.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.760]   I wonder if I would be growing.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.880]   That was the best chance.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.040]   Maybe it would make up.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:59.000]   This was four years ago, so the beard
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.800]   was just a twinkle in your eye this time.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.360]   OK, let's talk about something else.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.320]   Enough about Penguin.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.760]   I think I'm never going to get anything out of you anyway,
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.200]   so it's just as well.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.400]   Folks are working hard to make things better all the time.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.080]   That's the main thing to know.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.600]   Yeah, and I think that's actually really cool,
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.480]   this kind of--
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.520]   I mean, that's your business.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.160]   The Coke never changes the secret recipe,
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.160]   but Google has to constantly adjust the secret recipe.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.480]   Right, well, and the web changes,
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.120]   so you have to adapt to that as well.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.320]   Right, it's not merely to improve your algorithm.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.280]   It's actually to respond to things that have changed.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:39.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:40.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.800]   People care more about freshness and breaking news now,
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.720]   for example, so you've got to respond to those kinds of things.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.200]   I am not going to--
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.320]   and Gadget has a headline which I would not really support.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:56.360]   Google's creepy plan to kill the password.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.880]   However, they are talking about something called Project
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:05.720]   Abacus, which I think is fascinating.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.400]   Your phone would generate a trust score
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.480]   as it monitors location patterns, voice and speech patterns,
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:18.120]   how you walk, how you type, images that come in through the camera.
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:21.200]   And if you think about it, it doesn't take a whole lot of data
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:25.400]   points to be a unique fingerprint, better than a fingerprint.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.080]   You.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.400]   Well--
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.600]   Yeah, but that means like I go to the wrong part of town
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.120]   and injure myself, and suddenly my phone stops working.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.520]   I can't go for help.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:39.160]   There's a challenge with a lot of these pattern matching things,
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.480]   is that they try and really hard to fit you into a box.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.520]   And that you still need an escape from the box.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.840]   And that's often problem with this.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.800]   I'm not sure why Violet Blue's writing about this,
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:53.320]   because this was announced at Google I/O last year.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.760]   This was part of the A-Tap presentation.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.080]   Or maybe we're getting close to this.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.080]   I don't know.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.800]   Maybe more of it's coming out soon.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.440]   Well, maybe that's--
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.920]   Yeah, I have seen a few stories on it.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.200]   So I don't think it's a bad idea.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.640]   I think it's a very interesting idea.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.320]   Really, the problem of authentication
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:16.400]   is a very difficult problem and a very important problem.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.920]   It's really passwords.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.840]   It's clear are the worst way to solve it.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.360]   And that's--
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:22.960]   So broken.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.480]   They're broken.
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.000]   And it's a new thing, because I never really
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.720]   thought about this, but somebody said something.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.960]   Until recently, the only thing you had a member base,
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.440]   maybe your phone number and your locker combination.
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:39.040]   And now we've got to remember, if we're doing it right,
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.840]   unique passwords for hundreds of different sites
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.080]   and computers and stuff.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.560]   And of course, nobody can do that.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.680]   So the incentive is to write it down, put it on a post-it note,
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.160]   come up with some-- or use the same password all the time,
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.520]   which is what I think almost everybody does.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.960]   And is really dangerous, too.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:18:59.960]   Right.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.960]   Right.
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.840]   So we use password managers.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.960]   And people watch these shows, I'm sure,
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.400]   are all using password managers.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:12.840]   But recently, we talked about yesterday on security now.
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.920]   Somebody-- a security researcher showed how easy it
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.880]   would be to fish last passes--
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.040]   not merely last passes password login,
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.160]   but their second factor.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.960]   In fact, it's easier if you're using two factor with last pass.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.280]   And oh, what are you using?
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.720]   A Yuba key.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.040]   Yes.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.880]   Google calls it a security key, but basically,
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.840]   it makes you less susceptible to fishing.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.280]   And the nice thing about this is when
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.880]   you need to authenticate, you just insert this USB in
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.240]   and you press the button.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.480]   And so somebody physically needs to be there.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.200]   But it also relies on a hash of the domain name.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.560]   So you can't get fished because-- or you can't really be fished
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.480]   because this will only authenticate to a valid Google.com
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.000]   domain, for example.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.960]   And it's an open standard FIDO, UDF.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.760]   You can look it all up.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:03.400]   That's FIDO.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:03.760]   OK.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:04.760]   That's a FIDO to this.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.040]   So if you've got passwords here, two factor authentication
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.560]   is here.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.400]   Security keys are up here.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.440]   And you have to spend a little bit of money to get one,
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.520]   but it makes you so much less likely to get hacked.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.840]   I worry about losing the key, though.
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.640]   I think you can always fall back on things like passwords
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.560]   and texts to your phone and stuff like that.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.600]   But I really feel like you're a lot more secure
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.040]   if you're willing to take that extra step.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.440]   Is FIDO about two factor?
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.360]   Is it essentially a second factor?
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.840]   Or--
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.720]   As I understand it, yes.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:41.000]   It's sort of a framework that lets you do this sort
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   of authentication, as I understand it.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.960]   I'm not 100% sure.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.080]   And Kevin Marks, you pointed in the chat room
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:51.440]   to a site called Will Someone That Uses Email
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.080]   Authentication.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.240]   Now, this is a site that a friend of mine put together.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.840]   And this uses email and talk of education.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:00.480]   But it doesn't make you create passwords.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.560]   And when you do that, you send--
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.280]   you put your email in it, sends your new email,
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.480]   and you click through on the email.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.240]   And that's it.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.160]   You're it then in, which we will--
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.960]   I'll start with the other sites.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.920]   Does it set a cookie in the browser?
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.520]   How does it do that?
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:18.000]   It sets a cookie in the browser once you are logged in.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:18.480]   Yes.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:24.120]   See, that's not a great solution for security.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.320]   Facebook does the same thing.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.360]   Once you authenticate with Facebook, it's--
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.160]   It sends the unique ID to your email, a link.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.720]   You click on that link, and then you go there,
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.120]   and then there's a cookie set, which everything else does as well.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.480]   Every time you sign in a cookie, it says--
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.280]   Right.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.520]   But as we saw with Fire Sheep, that's--
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.480]   if there's a flaw in a browser, or if you're not using HTTPS,
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.640]   that cookie can be vulnerable.
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.160]   Right.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.960]   But that's-- it's less vulnerable than a visual password.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.280]   Yeah, this is the whole problem.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.480]   I'm not saying this is trivial.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.240]   Oh, it's very hard.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:21:59.600]   Let me see.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.880]   I just got the email from Will Someone.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.120]   Can I show the email, or is that going to have something--
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.080]   It's a one-shot link.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.800]   So you should-- you can show it after you've clicked it.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.960]   OK.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.880]   So it says, hi, Will Someone provides
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.600]   individual communities a better way to ask for help.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.200]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.760]   Click this link below to create your account.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.840]   A lot of people do this, but it's never
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.560]   going to ask me for a password again.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.480]   So it's a non-expiring cookie?
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.200]   No, no, the cookie will expire.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.880]   But if it expires, then you have to log in again.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.480]   You do it again.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.520]   It will create you a new one of the things.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.200]   And it also lets you log in with the good,
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.040]   which is the other way around this,
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.840]   because then you're just telling the problem to Google,
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.160]   which they've put more effort into it
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.360]   and the little setup can do.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.680]   And that's OAuth, right?
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:43.840]   Is that OAuth?
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.640]   But again, if you're using Google's OAuth,
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.280]   you're basically using cookies too.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:49.800]   There's no--
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.560]   It's just that you need to be--
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.520]   Anything persistent would have to be cookie-based.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.640]   Although I'm warned for Mozilla, which
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.160]   had something called persona.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.400]   And I think they're in the process of shutting that down.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.240]   But it sort of had the idea of baking identity
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.840]   and authentication into the browser,
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.560]   which I think is pretty clever, because if people
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.040]   use a common browser, whether it's Firefox or Chrome
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.320]   or something like that, if that could handle more
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.800]   of the authentication where you don't have to remember
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.080]   the password's quite as much, I think that would be nice.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.280]   But it seems like the pendulum is swinging away
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.120]   from that rather than towards it, which is a shame.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.440]   Our friend Steve Gibson has a solution
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.360]   that he's hoping will gain some traction called squirrel.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.520]   And I think if it came from Google or Microsoft,
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.360]   it might have a shot, unfortunately,
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.520]   because it's just an individual doing it.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.960]   Although he's gotten a pretty good community going on around it.
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.240]   It's using QR code or--
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.680]   I don't really understand.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.480]   He's explained it to me like 1,000 times.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.560]   And I don't understand it.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.240]   But it has some advantages.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.240]   Because it's so quick to sign in, for instance,
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.120]   you could ask somebody to sign in every time.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.760]   And so you wouldn't have to store a cookie.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.240]   You could have active authentication every time.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.480]   I know my bank, for instance, is never
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.360]   going to set a cookie that just makes me--
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.080]   lets me log in any time I want.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.400]   That would be a bad idea.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.440]   So if you have a site that needs to be secure,
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.160]   you're going to have to have log in each and every time,
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.360]   preferably with a second factor.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.280]   Such a hard problem.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.680]   It's a shame.
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:30.400]   It is a shame.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.560]   Well, I mean, so this is one of our--
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.720]   and the way I've answered to this is called Indi-Off.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.240]   And the idea there is basically using the large sites
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.760]   that have put the effort into authentication
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.560]   to authenticate our own sites.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:49.440]   So we do that by linking-- you link from your own site
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.480]   to one of these silos.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.360]   And then from that silo, you link back to your site.
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.960]   So you've got a two-directional link.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.000]   This works great if you have a website
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.520]   that you can log--
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.240]   Facebook, Twitter.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.760]   Yeah, you need to have a website, though,
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.640]   that you could put these rel links in and all that.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.040]   So that's one of these models.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.040]   And I use this, by the way, because I'm on with NONE,
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.000]   that was easy to do.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.400]   And I modified the HTML on a variety of different places.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.720]   And so I can use Indi-Off, and I have.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.720]   And it works really great.
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.480]   In fact, I think I've used it on the show
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.480]   and gave out my cell phone number at the moment
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.480]   because you can also use SMS authentication.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.200]   I like SMS authentication.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.480]   What's wrong with that?
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.240]   Is there anything wrong with that?
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.080]   Well, the--
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.760]   Big side from Mac cuts.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.080]   Yeah, the carriers aren't always good at protecting you
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.080]   from getting hacked.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.000]   And it's possible to spoof phone numbers from time to time
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.560]   whenever you call in to get voicemail.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.840]   So the caller ID can be spoofable.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.800]   So I'm not sure I would trust my authentication to Verizon
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.640]   or AT&T or something like that.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:00.520]   So in the early days of PayPal, I had a PayPal football.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.760]   You press a button.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.720]   It was the same thing, right?
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.760]   It was an authenticator, just like Google Authenticator.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:11.280]   It would generate a six-digit code based on time plus secret.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.640]   And is that kind of what your Fido does?
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.320]   Yes.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.840]   So Google Authenticator and those kinds of standards
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:21.320]   usually use a secret hash and a time code.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.480]   So that way, you don't even need to have a net connection,
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.720]   which is very, very handy.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:30.520]   I think the Fido stuff, it puts the secret key or the secret key
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.520]   is actually on this kind.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.600]   It's on that, right?
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:33.960]   Can it be red?
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.000]   Could it be stolen from that?
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.520]   No, it must be encrypted.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.960]   I don't-- yeah, I think it's encrypted.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.000]   I'm not 100% sure.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   That's interesting.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.080]   Well, that's the question.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:42.600]   It depends.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:46.000]   If you plug that into another thing and then plug that through,
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.560]   you could probably do a man in the middle on it,
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.480]   to some extent.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.680]   I don't think so.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.560]   I think they--
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.080]   But you see the physical possession of it.
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.400]   So yeah.
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:54.320]   Right.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.080]   Darlene loves mad at you.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.320]   Oh, it's a--
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.000]   See?
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.680]   She sang a song called It's a Marshmallow World.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.680]   Who doesn't love that song?
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.360]   Apparently, somebody at Google loves it a lot,
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.400]   because it was used in the ad for Nexus phones.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.240]   You've seen the ad.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:12.640]   I love the ad.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.880]   Did Google not-- or the ad company, which is 72 and Sunny,
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.000]   did not ask her permission?
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.920]   The article is a little strange.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:30.600]   It sounds like it's not a copyright thing, but that it's--
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.920]   It embodied loves identity through the copying of her voice.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:39.560]   In other words, they used an impersonator.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.840]   I--
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.360]   Maybe not.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.680]   Oh, so they made a cover for it.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:43.480]   They made a cover.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.520]   So you get the songwriting thing, which
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.720]   doesn't get the recording sync-face.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:47.200]   It's a--
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.240]   Right.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.760]   Because she didn't write the song.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.000]   So presumably, the publishing rights were paid.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:52.680]   Oh, OK.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.360]   The performance rights maybe weren't paid.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.120]   Here, you can play it.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:56.600]   It's OK.
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.520]   She can sue me too.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.160]   I'd love to meet darling love.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.560]   That sounds like her, doesn't it?
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.880]   It might be.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.840]   And they might have tried to get the rights.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:11.000]   There's some interesting things here where they claim
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.440]   there's a dispute between she and Phil Speckner
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.400]   or something.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.200]   The question will arise when the rights love retained or gave up
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:21.200]   when working with the Specker on its a Marshmallow World.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.720]   So there's--
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.920]   It's complicated.
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:24.560]   It's difficult.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.520]   As with all of these things.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:29.960]   This is like the Jonathan Colton one and Glee, isn't it?
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.920]   Yeah, he just-- I think he just said screw--
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.240]   I mean, what did he end up doing?
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.040]   I remember I talked to him about it and I forgot.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.400]   He ended up releasing his version of it
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.600]   and then telling people to send him money for it or something.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.120]   So he covered--
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.600]   I like big butts as a folk singer.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:48.320]   And then Glee basically completely recreated his--
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.520]   Right.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.520]   He's pacing himself.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.400]   We played him side by side when I was interviewing Jonathan.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:52.900]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:53.840]   And I went probably on triangulation.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.600]   And it was, clearly, a copy.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:59.240]   But I then talked to somebody who works in the music acquisition
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.000]   department of Glee.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.640]   I think I could say this now because Glee is now gone, right?
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.440]   He said, oh, we never got rights.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.360]   We just do it.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.000]   And then wait for the letter and then pay them
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.400]   if they send us a letter.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.160]   But the thing is, Glee is normally recording covers,
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.240]   which you are allowed to do.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.440]   That's actually one of the things--
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.560]   You don't have to pay for cover.
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:24.520]   I know you don't-- I know Weird Al doesn't have to pay for parodies.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.520]   No, you don't have to pay to record a cover
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.400]   because there's a statutory thing.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.480]   So you have to pay what you pay as a statutory thing.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.360]   You pay the publishing rights.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.480]   You pay the publishing rights.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.160]   But you don't pay the recording artist.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.440]   You get the same writers.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:36.920]   Right.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.280]   Ranges and so on.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.120]   And so Glee, by re-recording songs,
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.720]   is totally in the clear from that front.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:47.160]   But it's a bit weird if they're actually
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.520]   not doing an original performance
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.800]   but actually doing a sort of clone performance.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.720]   And that gets a bit odd.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.760]   Because then the argument is they're
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.240]   cloning his arrangement, but that's harder to do.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.120]   And it's a mess.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.160]   Basically, all this copyright stuff is a horrible mess.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:04.320]   And they're basically being a bit sketchy.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.760]   It wouldn't have hurt them much to have thanked him
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.000]   and invited him on the show.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.160]   I agree.
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.200]   And that would seem like most sense.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.920]   Give him some Glee merch.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.880]   Oh, give.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:17.320]   Having come on the show and perform.
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:20.520]   That's the thing that Glee could do for artists is give them--
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:21.520]   Would be nice.
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.000]   Exposure to a larger audience.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.040]   So that's a natural thing for them, so that makes sense.
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:27.400]   So a lot of people in our chat room
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:31.760]   have been talking about TAP10.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.360]   This is something Google's doing for Android pay users.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:43.160]   So I don't-- and I don't--
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:46.200]   has anybody in the chat room been paid?
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.720]   Have you received your free music?
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:51.480]   They talked a little bit about it last night on all about Android.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.760]   And it's rolling out very slowly.
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.000]   It's a small program currently being tested
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.320]   with a limited set of users according to Google.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:08.760]   So what do you do when you use your Google Pay?
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.960]   Yeah, when you use Android Pay--
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.960]   I'm sorry, Android Pay.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   And it gives you an opt-in screen.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:20.120]   When you pay 10 times with Android Pay, then you get something.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.200]   Yeah, they talked about it at the break.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.600]   They broke down last night.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.920]   You get a free song on the first purchase.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.520]   On the third, you get another free song.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:30.200]   And then after 10, you get a free Chromecast.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.080]   Wow, that's nice.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:34.320]   That's a deal.
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.360]   $35 value.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.360]   I love my Chromecast.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.080]   I actually have extras.
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.600]   Because I just kept buying them.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:42.200]   They're so cheap.
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.000]   I just kept buying them.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.800]   I realized, oh, I don't have that many TVs.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.600]   I did the same thing with Chromecast Audio.
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.520]   I've put Chromecast Audio on every possible powered speaker
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.840]   I could find.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.960]   And I have a couple left over.
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:57.400]   That's great.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.600]   Because I love it.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.240]   It's wonderful.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:00.760]   Who doesn't?
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:01.360]   It's so great.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.440]   And it's inexpensive.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.640]   I think I bought it when there was some deal going on
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.320]   or something like that.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.160]   There's a Netflix month thing that--
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.920]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.960]   I think I have 12 years of Netflix free.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.880]   Except that you couldn't queue them up or something.
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.720]   So I'm not sure I actually managed to claim all the ones
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.160]   that I got from it.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.000]   Oh, no.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.680]   It also came with credit on Google Play.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.440]   So the original one was a huge deal.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.160]   Because you paid $35 and got almost that much credit
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:27.840]   straight away.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:29.840]   That's probably what I'm doing.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:30.280]   They stopped doing that.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.960]   So I realized it was already a good deal.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.880]   Yeah, they don't need to-- they don't need to encourage it.
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.640]   And then there's one with Google survey
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:40.080]   that Chatram has been doing a lot of--
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.800]   --surface lately.
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.280]   Which means your results, I'm sorry, Matt.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.000]   They're suck.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:47.760]   No, no.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.840]   No, it's actually--
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:51.880]   so I love the Google Consumer Survey team,
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:55.160]   because it's another way to monetize for publishers.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.400]   Instead of a pay wall, it's like, you have this one survey
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.440]   question.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.840]   And you can earn app credit by answering questions.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.480]   So which is great, except, of course,
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:07.160]   then you have abuse, where you have people who are like, oh,
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.920]   I'm just going to always click A real fast.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:11.080]   I'm going to earn three bucks, which I can spend on it.
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.360]   But they only let you do it one a day now, or something
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.200]   like that.
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:17.560]   Well, they have some fake questions.
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:18.800]   Oh.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.160]   They're like, what is your favorite song by Abba,
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:21.640]   or whatever?
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:24.080]   And one of the songs will be completely fake.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.840]   And so anybody who just answers something that's
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.920]   going to be a long, you know, he's just
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:29.760]   clicking A all the time.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.200]   So this is the--
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.000]   This is Google Opinion Rewards.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000]   Is that it?
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:36.640]   OK, just--
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:37.920]   Yeah, that's what I use.
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:39.840]   That's what you use.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.440]   And then what letter do you tap all the time?
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.160]   I'm just kidding.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.720]   I'm sure you answer all the questions.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.400]   No, I got it here.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.720]   I just downloaded it.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.720]   I want to-- because I can get free--
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.360]   you get free Google Play credit, right?
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.400]   You've done a lot of them.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.440]   Look at that.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.000]   Holy cow.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.640]   So you can do more than one a day.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:33:59.600]   You've already done four.
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:02.440]   What are we paying paying you for, Jason?
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.920]   We've done four today.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.320]   They're literally like 30 cents.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.600]   Are you doing this now while we're--
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.960]   Yeah, yeah, while we're switching.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.160]   That's why my switches are a little delayed.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.000]   He's a hard-working guy.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000]   He's earned $61.95.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.240]   Yeah, but that's when that started.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.120]   You mean some credit?
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.800]   It's been like three years or two years.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:23.560]   Oh, it's been a long time.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.480]   Been a long time.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.000]   Been a long time.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.560]   But I pay for a lot of apps with that.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.120]   I'm going to do this.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.080]   The only thing is it does get a little creepy at times
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:34.280]   because it'll be like, so did you go to Safeway yesterday?
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.120]   I'm like, yes.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.200]   Which I think and Matt--
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.800]   Did you see this question?
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.640]   Does this help with the Google Maps?
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.760]   Like tracking data.
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.600]   Oh, they can't tie into that.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.680]   That's a good question.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:49.840]   I don't know if they had permission to do that.
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.840]   That would be a pretty brilliant thing to do.
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.640]   Let me see what permissions I'm out.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.760]   You know what you're doing?
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.280]   If you go into history on Google,
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.520]   it'll tell you where you've been.
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.840]   No, but they can't do it with that permission.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.600]   Google will use the responses to this service
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.240]   and your relevant service from researchers.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.840]   Responses to these surveys-- oh, this is the test survey--
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:08.280]   are not connected to your Google profile,
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.680]   but a record of your participation
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.200]   is kept to credit your Google Play balance.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.160]   I understand.
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.120]   I said, please continue.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.920]   What is your gender?
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.160]   What is your age?
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.680]   Too old for this survey?
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:27.360]   My zipper is 94952.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.040]   So they have some information about--
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.320]   Do you live in an urban, suburban, or rural area?
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.720]   I think this is suburban.
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:37.400]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.400]   I'm not going to answer that question.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.080]   Is which part of town you're in?
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.840]   Enter my occupation.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.520]   You know what I want to thank them?
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:46.920]   Because usually there's a drop down,
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:49.720]   and I'm none of the above.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:50.200]   Right, Matt?
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.360]   What do you put in there?
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.080]   Google Engineer.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.040]   Wait, it has podcaster in the list?
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:55.520]   It doesn't.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.400]   Although it says, for example, software engineer.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.560]   So you could just say, yeah, that's right.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.280]   I should say podcaster.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.320]   Let's see.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.440]   Oh, look, legislator, lodging manager,
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:05.960]   or farm labor contractor.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:06.920]   I see.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.920]   No, it doesn't have podcaster.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.920]   Emotions-- well, but I can fill it in.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:13.760]   I think it lets me-- it's freeform.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.120]   It'll let me freeform here.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.160]   Oops.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.320]   Oh, well.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.280]   Thanks, I'm a pod.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.280]   It's your pod pod.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:21.280]   Pod.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:27.000]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.720]   I'm a pod person.
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.280]   In some age of the body's naturities, that's me.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.200]   Yeah, that was me.
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:35.720]   That was my work.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.600]   So then I can answer a survey and earn some credit.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.240]   That's cool.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.600]   Yes, I'd say no survey is available right now.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.720]   Survey tutorial.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:43.320]   Ooh.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:46.440]   Yeah, because it's so hard to answer questions.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:49.040]   In general, do you approve or disapprove
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.760]   of the efforts of the United Nations?
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:52.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:56.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.880]   Sometimes symbols are associated
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.320]   with a particular idea or concept.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.400]   What is the symbol below?
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.120]   This must be the anti-spam thing.
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.000]   What is the symbol below associated with?
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.080]   Yin and Yang.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.560]   No, you don't want robots.
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.120]   Which of the following are continents?
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.720]   This is hard.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:18.560]   None of the above are continents.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:22.040]   Now, that's an intelligence test.
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:24.960]   China, France, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.280]   Knowledge or culture.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.640]   I think Google can you reward--
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:29.840]   It's asking me about the United Nations.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:32.600]   --twice it as being about the United Nations.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:32.880]   Well--
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.600]   Suppose you had an opportunity to have a message
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:37.000]   you created in front of your government officials.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:39.920]   What?
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.600]   Suppose you had an opportunity to have a message you created
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:45.320]   read in front of your government officials.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:49.120]   In a few words, what would you say?
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:49.480]   Mm.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.760]   Campaign Finance Reform.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:51.800]   Yes.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.280]   Thank you.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.360]   Thank you.
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:55.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:57.080]   I want to enter it.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.480]   Clothoo, Barada, Nikto.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.440]   Let's see.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.640]   Doesn't that end the world?
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:08.000]   Hey, it knows Clothoo, Barada, Nikto.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.640]   Holy cow, it speaks whatever.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.560]   Robbie the robot.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.520]   For his recognition.
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.080]   Wow.
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.160]   It's spelled Clothoo right.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.200]   Oh, it's still talking.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.120]   In some countries, a president is head of the government.
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.280]   In others, it is the prime minister
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:24.440]   to show you are still paying attention.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.440]   Please select five stars.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:32.640]   This is is this unintentionally humorous or are they new?
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.760]   I think they knew.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.320]   I think these are the questions to make sure
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.880]   that people aren't just faking it,
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:38.040]   signing up for new accounts or whatever.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.760]   That is awesome.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.840]   I don't feel like a robot anymore.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:43.920]   Wow.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.040]   Thank you, Google Opinion Rewards.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.800]   Click the green checkmark.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:49.520]   New survey available.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.880]   New survey available.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:51.560]   There you go.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.440]   What does this icon look like to you?
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.240]   OK, I know where this is coming from.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:58.840]   So this is some designer paid for this or some company paid
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:01.480]   for this or maybe even Google would like to know,
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:03.280]   what the hell does that mean?
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.240]   It's a timer, right?
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.920]   So you can do your own survey at Google Consumer Surveys.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:09.920]   You can make your own survey.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.080]   Do you pay for it a little bit?
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:11.280]   Look at that.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:11.800]   Whoa.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:12.480]   Whoa.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.720]   I got a buck for that.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:15.840]   Best dollar you ever earned.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.440]   And never going to see that again, am I?
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.040]   That's like when you do a Bitcoin miner
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:19.960]   and you get a Bitcoin.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.320]   It's like that's the last time you ever
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:23.240]   going to see a Bitcoin.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:24.280]   You can buy a song.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:24.920]   I can buy a song.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:27.120]   I got a whole buck.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.400]   Share this with your friends.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:34.720]   I do like this new ability built into search
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.960]   to install apps directly from search results.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.520]   I think that's pretty cool.
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.320]   You have to be on an Android mobile to do that, right?
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.440]   I think so.
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.560]   Well, you wouldn't have to.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.680]   The Play Store knows to--
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:48.160]   I know.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.680]   I install it from the Play Store all the time.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:52.480]   I think it's like one of the best things about Android.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.160]   But maybe they'll start with that.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:55.800]   Start with mobile.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.300]   Yeah.
[01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:57.520]   I think it's rolling this.
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.160]   Another one of those, it's rolling it out.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:08.560]   They fixed the stuck pen on the Galaxy S5.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.680]   Little too late for some of us.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.760]   Who are you looking around for, Leo?
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.200]   So.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.080]   Rana Mario.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:21.160]   Yeah, Rana Mario.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:24.920]   That's to screw it up.
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.680]   So as everybody knows, I stuck mine in the wrong way.
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.160]   And I paid the price.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:33.960]   But now there will be something--
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:36.840]   not only-- the first fix was to put a warning sticker
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:40.160]   on the screen, which probably caused more pens
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.040]   to be stuck in wrong than anything else.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:44.680]   I stayed in experiment with the statement.
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.160]   Don't stick it in the wrong way.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:46.560]   Oh, really?
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.080]   What happens?
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.080]   Let me see.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:51.680]   Because I know I did that.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:54.360]   So now something's going on.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:58.360]   They've put a flexible plastic cover over the little switch
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:02.120]   that breaks, and it gives it a ramp.
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:04.520]   So it pushes-- anyway, it's a simple fix.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:08.920]   But they've-- they also say the cover is now attached
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:10.240]   with adhesive tape.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.120]   I don't know.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.880]   Nice fix, Samsung.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.720]   Samsung hasn't said it will be offering this fix
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:17.160]   to existing customers.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.040]   So if you have--
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.640]   don't think that this fix is retroactive.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:26.000]   If you have a note 5, do not--
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.800]   I repeat, do not stick your pen in wrong.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:32.360]   Not retroactive.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.040]   Be careful.
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.680]   Be careful.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.960]   Disappointing speaking of Google Cast,
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.360]   Denon, apparently.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.040]   Stop it.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.920]   Somebody's showing a video of somebody sticking them wrong.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:50.960]   Apparently, Denon and Google had a partnership.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:57.040]   And at that time, it was said that Denon would support Google
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:00.000]   Cast in some speakers.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.200]   I'd like to see it in Denon.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:06.080]   I would actually actively buy AR receivers that had cast built
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.880]   in.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:08.800]   But nobody's done that.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.760]   Not that it's so hard to-- in fact, I
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.960]   have a few extras, as you know, lying around.
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.080]   Stick a cast in that.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:20.480]   But anyway, Denon has never done anything with that,
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.400]   which is disappointing.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.200]   Cast Partners announced in January at CES
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:29.040]   include BNO Play, Harman Cardin, Ankyo, Phillips, Pioneer,
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:29.800]   and Rompfeld.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:37.800]   Anything else you guys want to talk about before we wrap this up?
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.920]   I was loving it.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.960]   I was-- we started talking about Brave,
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.120]   and then forgot to finish the conversation.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.400]   Brave.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.080]   So Brave is a new browser from Brendan
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:50.360]   Ike and a bunch of other people.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.360]   And it fits into the ad blocking conversation.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:52.720]   Because--
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.320]   Well, it doesn't.
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:57.720]   It doesn't, because it sticks its own ads in.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.480]   Well, sure.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:58.880]   Well, that's the same as--
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.720]   Well, sure.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.320]   The same as ad does.
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.120]   You know, ad blocks ads, as they support other ads in.
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.720]   Most ad blockers don't stick ads in place of the other ads.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:09.240]   Absolutely.
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:11.120]   They do.
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.800]   Have you not been following this?
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:13.440]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:16.080]   Well, I'm using UBlock Origin, which does not.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:16.360]   OK.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.760]   But a lot of the ad blockers now actually either
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:20.840]   take money to whitelist certain ad--
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.000]   That I know.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:22.600]   That's fine.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:25.000]   We actually interviewed on "Tranulation,"
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.480]   the guys behind adblock plus, which
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:31.200]   has this approved advertiser list--
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.440]   Google's on it, by the way.
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:37.400]   They say it's not that we take money for this.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:40.320]   Like, you can't pay to be on the list.
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.800]   You have to fit our guidelines.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:46.840]   And we do ask for money because that defrays the costs of it.
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.800]   That's how we make the software.
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.160]   But you could make them.
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:50.520]   You could--
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:50.880]   You could--
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:51.360]   Yeah, I did.
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:52.720]   --find that way.
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.440]   But you know, so it's another iteration of that same idea,
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:59.920]   basically.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:02.000]   But they also said we're making a browser.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.880]   But if you actually look at their open source stuff,
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:05.240]   they've bought three different browsers
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.560]   on three different platforms, which is also a bit strange.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.040]   So--
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:12.080]   Interesting idea, but yeah, monitor and see where it goes.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.880]   So it's right now, it's on GitHub.
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.480]   Yes, right now there's three GitHub projects.
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:22.200]   And they've forked Link Bubble on Android.
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:28.000]   And they've forked some Chromium Vera on iOS.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.560]   And they've forked something else for the desktop.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.640]   So it's three separate browser projects
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.320]   they've decided for three different platforms.
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.600]   So it's not a new browser.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.880]   It's a set of forks of existing browsers.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:41.120]   So it's a Biz Model fork, to some extent.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:45.000]   Brendan Iquas, of course, ran a Mozilla project before he left.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000]   Yes.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.360]   HTTPS everywhere is built in, which I like.
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.520]   That's good.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:54.280]   So it's basically saying, what if we made a browser that
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:59.000]   worked better because it was taking ads out of everything?
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:44:59.480]   App Lock--
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.440]   Plus makes a browser for Android that does that.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:03.320]   Right.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:06.920]   And Apple's hooks potentially do that on iOS.
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:10.240]   Yeah, you have to download a blocker, but you can do that.
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.120]   Firefox-- I didn't realize this, but Firefox support--
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:17.040]   on mobile supports Firefox extensions.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:21.720]   So you could put an ad blocker in Firefox on mobile.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:22.880]   Right.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.720]   But there are a few people around Firefox mobile.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:25.160]   That's true.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.280]   Yeah, I think Firefox and mobile is one of the things they've
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:28.280]   fought.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:30.120]   It's just their iOS thing, I think.
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:33.960]   So it also blocks tracking pixels and tracking cookies,
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.280]   which-- now I have to say one thing that--
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.120]   I understand that there are multiple reasons why people use
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:39.640]   ad blockers.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:42.200]   One is just ads are annoying, and I understand that.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:44.160]   Another is for security reasons.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.440]   In fact, what was the website?
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:49.000]   Forbes.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.600]   Forbes.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.400]   You know this.
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.400]   Forbes has been one of many websites to say, oh, I see
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.600]   you're running an ad blocker.
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.360]   Would you mind turning that off?
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.400]   Because that's how we support ourselves.
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:06.880]   And if you did, it would get malware promotions.
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:09.280]   I don't know if you'd actually get the malware,
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.840]   but you've got to pop under that encouraged you to download
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.240]   malware.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:14.840]   Right.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.240]   Which is why-- another reason why people run ad blockers,
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.640]   they also run ad blockers for privacy reasons,
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.240]   because they worry about tracking.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.400]   But one of the side effects of that
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.800]   is that things like Google Analytics
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:30.280]   are often broken by ad blockers.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:33.040]   It was well, which means a publisher, like me, for instance,
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:35.120]   I can't even get a metrics of people
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.800]   who come to my site using an ad blocker just
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:38.720]   are invisible to me.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.480]   I don't even know they're there.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.400]   And it looks like this does that as well.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:45.560]   It's hard to say.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:47.560]   It--
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.720]   What's still early days?
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.600]   Yeah, I think you would have to block JavaScript
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.880]   if you were going to block Google Analytics, I think,
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:56.480]   for some kinds of JavaScript.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:58.280]   Well, no, because it's a well-known domain,
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.280]   so you can block one and think.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.120]   You can just block it.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.120]   So you can control everything.
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:09.040]   Brave blocks tracking pixels and tracking cookies.
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:10.320]   I guess that's fine.
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:15.520]   I always turn on block third party cookies, only except cookies
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:17.040]   and sites you visit.
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.600]   Which is basically what they mean.
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:21.520]   But the challenge there is if you are--
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.080]   it will also block some of the things
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.480]   that you may want, but mostly it will get rid of those.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.960]   The thing is, if you have an iFrame on the site that
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:31.000]   is giving you some kind of his information,
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.760]   his comments on Facebook with something,
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.800]   then that may get blocked by it too.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:36.800]   So--
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.800]   Yeah, but--
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.800]   Go ahead.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.120]   I mean, it's part of the same conversation
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:43.160]   about the sort of super invasiveness of ad tech
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.160]   and the fight back.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.720]   And I think this fits in with that.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:48.240]   But I'm not necessarily sure it's going to be a great success.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:51.120]   But it's interesting looking that they've
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:54.840]   got Brendan and Yal and some people
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:00.160]   who I've got technical respect for behind it is interesting.
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.240]   So the one story that I thought was kind of interesting
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:07.200]   we didn't mention was Link NYC, which is the sort of really
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.240]   fast gigabit Wi-Fi in New York where it's
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:11.800]   releasing the telephone.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.680]   Yeah, since Deaf and Gina aren't on,
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:16.960]   I'll represent New York and be like, somebody said,
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:19.320]   she wanted to set up her office by the supposed stop
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.520]   at 17th and somewhere because it was like six times faster
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.400]   Wi-Fi.
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.440]   Apparently, they run fiber to these former telephone booths.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:28.440]   And it's rolling out.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.040]   It's a vendor Hardewar wrote on Engadget
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.360]   that he was getting, I think, 230 megabits down
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.040]   and something like 300 megabits up.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.040]   Oh, man.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:38.800]   Where do I get that?
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:39.400]   I'll sign up.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.560]   That's your Google fiber.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.800]   But you have to sit next to a phone booth in New York City
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:43.720]   to get it.
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:44.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:45.240]   Yes.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:46.280]   OK, so this is--
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:49.240]   I was in New York last week, and I missed that.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:51.360]   And I wrote-- I was struck by something.
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.600]   So I wrote a blog post about this.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:55.000]   I'll give you the argument for my blog post.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.960]   I just checked the blog post into the thing.
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:00.920]   But the frustrating thing about New York
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:04.880]   is that when you go on the subway, you lose connectivity.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:07.720]   And there's an ongoing project to try and get Wi-Fi and stuff
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:08.480]   on the subway.
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.480]   But it's hard because you've got to put transmitters
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.960]   on the ground and things.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:14.600]   And if they do it, they'd only be in stations
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:16.520]   and not in the tunnels and so on.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.960]   At the same time, New York is spending a fortune
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:24.520]   to try and refit the subway to work out where their trains are.
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:28.200]   Because actually, the way the train tracking works
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.720]   is the train--
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.760]   the train shorts out between the two tracks,
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:39.000]   and they have the different sections of the tracks subdivided
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:39.640]   into blocks.
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:42.840]   And they can tell that there's a train in that section.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:45.520]   But that's basically all they can tell in the central system.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:50.160]   And this is this fantastic, like early 20th century technology.
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.960]   There's a great article about it that I
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:54.160]   link to on The Atlantic that explains this.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:56.040]   And it was fascinating.
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:58.720]   The pictures of the switching stations
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.960]   with their-- literally, their 19th century technology
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.600]   is really amazing.
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:04.720]   That's one of us here.
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:05.840]   I recommend you will read it.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.040]   But the thing that struck me as I was sitting on the subway
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.360]   going, why the hell does my phone not
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:13.840]   able to give me transit directions when I'm offline,
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:16.520]   which is my rant to Google Maps, is that Google's missing
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:18.280]   a huge trick here.
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.840]   Now, Google already knows how to track people
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:23.680]   when they're driving or cycling or walking.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:25.320]   And it can tell what you're doing.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.200]   It will also sum over all the people in cars
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.800]   to get freeway traffic.
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.520]   But it's really bad understanding
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:33.760]   that you're on a bus or a train.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.960]   Which should be-- if you've got connectivity,
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.800]   it's the same problem.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.160]   It's, am I moving at a certain speed in a certain path?
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:44.720]   Oh, are there another 20 people who are experiencing
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.080]   identical accelerations nearby?
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.000]   Well, you're probably on a train or a bus.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.560]   So it's something that you could certainly
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:50.920]   solve from Google Maps point of view,
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:53.880]   is which bus are you on, which train are you on.
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:55.800]   But also, this would actually solve the problem
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.800]   for the transit company, which is where is that bus,
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:58.760]   where is that train?
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.840]   Because, oh, look, we've just put 30 people
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.840]   to track the bus for us.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.440]   So I'm puzzled that this hasn't happened.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:08.640]   And I know it's one of these like political will things.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.520]   But there's a step-- there's a process here,
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:13.400]   which is first Google actually applies its smart tracking
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.720]   technology to work out where buses and trains are, which
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:20.040]   is-- I know it's doable, but they just haven't thought of it.
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:22.280]   Probably because most of the engineers on maps
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:26.280]   are in Mountain View and don't use public transit much.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.520]   But the other half of this that was the real breakthrough
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.640]   thought was, well, Google should actually
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:34.480]   pitch for the NYC subway contract for Wi-Fi.
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.960]   Because A, that's-- suddenly, they've
[01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:39.640]   got a whole bunch of users who are captive users for Wi-Fi.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.000]   And that'd be great.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.280]   But also, they will actually solve the where are the trains
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:46.040]   and where are the problems and actually clears that loop.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.280]   Anyway, this isn't a free idea for Google.
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:52.400]   I don't know if Lincoln YC is a private enterprise,
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:56.320]   or I think this was an initiative by Mary de Blasio.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.240]   I'm not sure.
[01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:59.360]   But there are no ads.
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:02.520]   You don't get any-- it is obviously a captive portal.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:03.760]   But you don't get ads.
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.840]   Apparently, the ads that's sponsored
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.680]   are only on the screen at the phone booth.
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:09.680]   And the other thing I'm--
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:10.560]   That's quite where it's gone.
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:14.320]   So when I was at BT, I wrote a pitch up for this for BT.
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:16.160]   Because it's like, hey, we have all these phone boxes
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:16.680]   in the streets.
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:18.080]   We should turn them into Wi-Fi hotspots.
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:19.320]   Well, that's kind of interesting.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:21.400]   But it's kind of hard.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:22.160]   And I--
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:22.720]   It is hard.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:23.360]   I'm sure.
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:23.840]   It is hard.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.000]   And it's hard.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.240]   And I wasn't able to get it through politically.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.760]   But it's an obvious thing to do.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:32.080]   It's like they've actually built cables to points in the street.
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:33.360]   They will no longer need to pick them up
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.960]   and put money into it, phones on it.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.400]   But make them Wi-Fi based stations is a great idea.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:38.400]   And they're very well-corning.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:41.280]   And they're using the hole in the ground.
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.840]   But can they use other existing infrastructure,
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.160]   like the phone wires?
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:46.880]   It depends.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.080]   I mean, if you're the phone company, you can.
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:49.880]   Because that's just--
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:50.800]   You own the copper.
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:51.560]   That's DSL.
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.160]   You own the copper.
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:56.160]   This is faster than DSL, I gotta say.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.720]   Well, you also have the right to rerun conduit
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:58.480]   for the phone company.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:00.760]   That's one of the easements you get for being phone.
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:04.080]   So there's a natural correlation between the two there.
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:07.000]   I have a friend who actually bought from AT&T
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.720]   the rights to all the phone booths.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:12.640]   Because AT&T, the money they were making on phone booths
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.160]   was de minimis, so they didn't care.
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:16.200]   He got it for a song.
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:19.120]   He continues to run them because there are places,
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:21.720]   lots of places where people need phone booths.
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:26.600]   And in almost every case, it's cell infrastructure now.
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:29.520]   They don't bother with trying to put them on a landline.
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:31.960]   It's just a little cell site.
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:35.160]   And more than that, he says, the real challenge
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:39.960]   of the business is a logistics problem, collecting the coins.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:41.400]   I know.
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:44.080]   That's where the brain power goes,
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:47.480]   is how do we get the coins, affordably and efficiently,
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.440]   out of the box?
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.120]   Because you've got to do that.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:53.440]   So he's apparently got some sort of technology that
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.640]   weighs the thing.
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:59.440]   And they've now applied this to the Nestle's freezers.
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:00.800]   He also expanded the business.
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.320]   He says, we're good at this.
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.120]   What else can we apply this knowledge to?
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:07.840]   Oh, you know those freezers in the 7/11 or whatever,
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.760]   where you buy ice cream treats?
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:13.800]   Well, that's that turns out a similar logistics issue
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:16.560]   is to restock those in an efficient way.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:20.360]   And so now they actually have little scales,
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:23.000]   probably little MEMs, scales on the feet of these things,
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.720]   so they know when they have to be restocked
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:26.040]   because they weigh less.
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:30.680]   Anyway, I want to say one good thing about link NYC,
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:33.560]   they're doing the security right.
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:37.080]   And Devinder pointed this out when you connect with it,
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:40.680]   you get a private key that's unique to you,
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:44.040]   you add that private key to your device.
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:47.000]   And so as I understand it, in effect,
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.320]   you are privately connected to this network.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:53.200]   So it doesn't have some of the other problems
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:57.120]   that public Wi-Fi are heir to or prone to, which is great.
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:58.120]   Justine.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:59.720]   And Leo, there's one other nice feature
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:01.440]   which is called Pass Point,
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:04.120]   which apparently lets you connect to the Wi-Fi
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:06.480]   without clicking the I agree to abide
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:08.040]   by your terms and conditions.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:09.760]   I think that's why you get the cert, right?
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.240]   You're getting a cert.
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:13.560]   And then it's like SSH login.
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:14.400]   They have your--
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.240]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:17.440]   'Cause the giant nightmare of public Wi-Fi
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.200]   is that they put captive portals up.
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:20.120]   Horrible.
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:21.640]   Particularly with transit ones, it's like,
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:23.320]   well, I'm trying to pass through this station,
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.680]   I don't have time to stop and go through
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:26.120]   your captive portal nonsense.
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:27.120]   So if you can actually do that
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.360]   and run across the city, that's a good idea.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.360]   This is a--
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:31.480]   But also, the idea of like,
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:33.320]   the advertising is not on the Wi-Fi,
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:36.520]   but on the Wi-Fi base station is also a very smart idea.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:38.200]   Makes people happy.
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:40.840]   Because you really don't want to mess with their connection
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:43.160]   and inject ad nonsense into it.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.680]   Whereas if you've got a physical point of presence,
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:48.960]   that's a sensible way to support it.
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:49.800]   Makes sense.
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:50.640]   You want to move to New York City.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:53.640]   That's the other side benefit of that.
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:54.560]   I want to wrap this up.
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:57.240]   We're going way long and I just have to hurry up.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:00.880]   Moving, moving, moving.
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:03.360]   Nothing more really critical that we need to say.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.800]   There's a lot of stories this week.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:06.840]   There's a huge number and I'm sure that you all
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:09.840]   have read them in great detail.
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.920]   So, all right.
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:13.920]   Nothing.
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:14.920]   Nothing crazy.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:15.920]   All right.
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:22.280]   Practical telepathy was invented in 2007.
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:23.880]   That's an article.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:27.760]   This is a great article by Charlie Strauss this week.
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:31.600]   So, he's basically talking about politics and the weird
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:32.760]   state of politics.
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:38.320]   His comment on practical telepathy is basically because we have
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.240]   Twitter and Facebook and all these social media with always
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:44.160]   connected devices, in effect, we're all sharing our thoughts
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:45.560]   with everyone all the time.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:49.360]   This has transformed the way politics is really it was.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.080]   It's certainly transformed politics, yes.
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:54.640]   So, I recommend reading the essay and the comments are fairly good too.
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:55.640]   Charlie's very smart.
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:58.320]   Is he now unaffiliated?
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.280]   Wasn't he at the Times or was he at the Mercury?
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:01.280]   I can't remember.
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.280]   No, no, no.
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:03.280]   Charlie Strauss is a science fiction author.
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:04.280]   He writes science fiction author.
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:06.760]   I'm thinking of his brother Randall.
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:07.760]   Yes.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:09.560]   Oh, are they brotheists?
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.560]   Are they?
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.560]   I don't know.
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:12.560]   I made that up.
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:13.560]   No, they might be.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:14.560]   I don't know.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:15.560]   Randall Strauss, yeah.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:16.560]   Yeah.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:19.400]   Well, except I think he's really Strauss is like Scott.
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:20.400]   I'm sure.
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.600]   Yes, he's way is English, but lives in Scotland.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.600]   Yes.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:24.600]   Okay.
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:27.680]   Would be Scottish if they split.
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:34.840]   Okay, as long as we're talking science fiction authors and by the way, who seem to understand
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:41.680]   all of this much better than you and I do, I should mention the dialogue.
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:49.520]   Let me see if I can get my pocket up because I made a copy of it.
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:50.520]   The dialogue between.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:51.520]   Oh, no, I can't.
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:53.240]   Where is my pocket app?
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:55.560]   Where are you, my pocket app?
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:56.560]   Open pocket.
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:58.560]   Okay, Google.
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.560]   Okay, Google.
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:00.560]   Open pocket.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:01.560]   It did.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:04.480]   That's not where I needed.
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:05.480]   It did.
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:08.480]   It totally did.
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:11.880]   Yeah, it was on the floor.
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:16.520]   It was on the floor and it did it.
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.440]   Bruce Sterling.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:25.120]   And apparently does this on a regular basis every year on the well of all places as a
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:26.120]   dialogue.
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:27.120]   Oh, I love that.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:28.120]   Have you read this?
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.120]   I've made this use one.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:30.120]   Yeah.
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.120]   Because it was out.
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.840]   I added it to my pocket because you really kind of basically have to scroll through the
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:38.680]   well to read it, which is not a non-trivial thing to do.
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:42.040]   But with John Lebkowski, apparently they do this every year.
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.240]   They talk in courier sands.
[01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:48.400]   No, this is, I'm sorry, new courier.
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:50.160]   They talk about the state of the world.
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:51.320]   It's a really great dialogue.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:54.720]   I've only got a little way into it, but just some great stuff here.
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:56.120]   All right, let's wrap it up.
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:57.120]   We got to wrap it up.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:58.120]   I got one more ad.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.360]   And then if you want picks or tips or anything you want to share, Matt, I'd love to know what
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:04.440]   your 30-day challenges these days, that kind of thing.
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:10.080]   But first, a reminder, your challenge, my friends, to take those old gadgets and recycle
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:13.800]   them intelligently, responsibly, with gazelle.com.
[01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:17.680]   Don't throw them in the drawer because that would be like throwing $100 bills in the drawer.
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:20.920]   I mean, you don't want to throw money away.
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.840]   And don't just throw them in the landfill.
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:24.400]   That would be worse.
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:26.200]   What you do is you go to gazelle.com.
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:31.560]   You can get a quote right now on your old iPhone, your old Samsung, a lot of different
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:38.240]   gadgets, smartphones, tablets, tablets from all sorts of manufacturers, including your
[01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:42.520]   old Microsoft Surface if you got a new one, Apple Max.
[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:44.480]   They will give you a quote that's guaranteed for 30 days.
[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.560]   They're locked in.
[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:49.600]   So you can take advantage of that any time in the 30 days, which means you get plenty
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:54.000]   of time to get a new device to move the data over and all of that.
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.440]   As we get closer to mobile world Congress, this might be the time to go to gazelle and
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:01.480]   get a quote for your old phone, $30 for my Surface RT.
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:03.280]   Hey, you know what?
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:06.720]   That's more than I expected.
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:08.240]   That ain't bad.
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:09.240]   That ain't bad.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:10.120]   Gazelle gives you top dollar.
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:13.400]   They also sell devices, pre-owned devices.
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:16.960]   And that's a great deal if you're looking to replace a broken phone or get a phone for
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:17.960]   the kids.
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:21.640]   You could get a phone that's gently used, but in every case works perfectly.
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:26.000]   They put it through a very rigorous 30 point inspection and you have 30 days to return
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000]   it if you don't like it.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.880]   So it is a good deal if you're buying an iPhone 4S through 6 Plus or an iPad, Air, standard
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:37.000]   mini models or a Samsung Galaxy phone.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.160]   Check it out on gazelle, pre-owned devices.
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:41.960]   It's the place to sell and buy.
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:49.080]   You have new life to use electronics at gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, gazelle.com.
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:50.080]   Today.
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:54.000]   All right, let's start with Mr. Matt Cutts.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.480]   What's your 30 day challenge these days?
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:00.800]   My 30 day challenge is to actually kind of slots with a gazelle thing.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.440]   It's to get rid of one thing per day.
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:06.520]   Because January is a great time to clean house.
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:12.360]   So you can start a pile for goodwill of magazine holders and stuff like that.
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:13.680]   You can sell it away.
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:14.840]   You can give it away.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.040]   USB things.
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:17.880]   Here's this great cap.
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.560]   Make the web great again like Donald Trump.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:21.560]   Except I know it's-
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:22.560]   I like that.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:23.560]   Are you giving that away?
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:24.560]   I'll take it.
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:25.560]   I'll send it to you.
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:26.560]   No, no, that's all right.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:27.560]   That's okay.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:29.800]   So I'm just trying to get rid of one thing every day.
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.280]   And it's actually kind of nice because it forces you to re-examine the sort of stuff
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:34.280]   that you're doing.
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:36.000]   But I do have one quick tip as well.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.200]   The good is the Google dance is back.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:44.160]   So we used to have something where we'd switch out our algorithm and have a new index.
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:47.400]   And we only had enough time to roll out one data center per day.
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:52.040]   And so every night we'd take one data center out of the rotation, update it, and then the
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:54.000]   rankings would be different at that data center.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:55.320]   And it would take about a week.
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:58.720]   So depending on which data center you'd hit, you'd get different rankings.
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:01.120]   And people would call that the Google dance.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:07.280]   Well, what we decided to do is actually have a dance at Google called the Google dance.
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:11.400]   And we stopped in like 2006 or something like that or 2008.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:13.040]   Is it actual dance?
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.560]   It's an actual dance.
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:18.360]   So people called it the Google dance and were like, well, let's have a dance.
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:21.240]   Let's have a t-shirt about the Google dance.
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:26.520]   And so there's a conference called SMX West, which means West Coast.
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:31.200]   And they're going to have like 500 or so of the attendees who can sign up to attend the
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:32.200]   Google dance.
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:33.200]   And I'm hoping to be there myself.
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.200]   It should be a lot of fun.
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:36.680]   Oh, that is exciting.
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:39.800]   And Danny Sullivan will be there doing the white man's overbite.
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.520]   Yes, it's his conference.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:47.320]   That sounds awesome.
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:53.560]   So if you have not yet bought tickets to SMX West, go right now to search engineland.com
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:55.600]   and sign up.
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:57.960]   You could be in the Google dance.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.960]   All the boys on the left, all the girls on the right just stare at each other across
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:01.960]   the hall.
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.560]   It'll be fun.
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:04.560]   Just like seventh grade.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:05.560]   Actually, you know what?
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:07.720]   Now, as you grow up, nerds love to dance.
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.520]   I've found that.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:10.520]   Great.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.560]   Thank you, Matt Cuts.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:13.880]   Appreciate that.
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:18.560]   Mr. Kevin Marks, a tip, a trick, like fill us in on IndieWeb.
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:22.560]   Well, IndieWeb Camp New York is happening this weekend.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:23.560]   Good.
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:30.040]   If you're in New York and want to spend weekend working on your own website or building Indie
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:32.920]   Web stuff for others, that says, "Again, I'll put the link in the chat."
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.840]   It's on the front page of IndieWeb Camp.com.
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:40.680]   And of course, we have Home Grid website club next Wednesday, not tonight, but week from
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:43.120]   tonight in various cities around the world.
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:44.120]   Love it.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:45.200]   You should be in there as well.
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:48.560]   And there's more Indie Web Camps coming up in the new year.
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:51.880]   There's one at MIT in March and there's various others that I've forgotten.
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:54.200]   But there's four or five already booked.
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:55.200]   I love it.
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:59.680]   You guys are fighting the good fight for web standards and the independent web.
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.760]   And it needs to be fought.
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:04.120]   IndieWeb Camp.com, if people want to learn.
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:11.640]   And also, one of the Indie Web specs has been published as a first public working draft
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:16.200]   by the W3C Social Web Standards Group.
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:17.760]   And that's what the web mentioned.
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:18.760]   So that's been published.
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:21.720]   The web mentioned is the way that a site can tell another site that you've linked that
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.720]   it's been linked to.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:27.080]   That's the first draft that W3C now.
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:29.280]   Kind of like trackback.
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:32.400]   It's kind of like trackback, but it's done over HTTP.
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:39.880]   And there's some wrinkles to it to make it like, so there's an HTTP post rather than
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:43.360]   done as an XMLRPC call and so on.
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:45.200]   So that's been published.
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:49.920]   And MicroPub is in the stages of about to be published.
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:53.200]   I think that may come out in the next week or so as well.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:05:00.080]   So MicroPub is a general API for letting you post your site from another site.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:04.280]   And that's another part of the sort of IndieWeb sort of protocol collection.
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:08.560]   So both of those are working-- which we're working to try and get those as web standards
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:09.560]   as part of W3C.
[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:14.480]   And there's that social working group there as a bunch of other protocols that things
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:15.480]   being discussed too.
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:18.720]   But those two of these sort of directly IndieWeb drive ones.
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:19.720]   Awesome.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:20.720]   Kevin Marks.
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:22.320]   A little tip for me.
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:26.280]   It might seem like a contradiction in terms, but now you can use Facebook anonymously.
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:28.360]   What a thought.
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:35.480]   Facebook which has had a Tor address for some time now has made it easy for you to do it
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:36.880]   on your Android device.
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:40.120]   You'll need Orbot, which is a Tor for Android.
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:45.680]   You download it and install it, point it to what is the Facebook Tor address I can't even
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:46.680]   remember?
[02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:49.360]   Is it-- I can't remember.
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:50.360]   You know what?
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:51.920]   You could figure it out.
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:58.880]   And so-- yeah, of course not because I'm not on Tor right now.
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:01.080]   But if I were, I'd be there by now.
[02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:04.760]   For some reason, I want to say Facebook.name, but that can't be right.
[02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:05.760]   Facebook.tor maybe.
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:07.720]   I can't remember what it is.
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:14.240]   But the Facebook is now allowing you to use it through a Tor which is kind of wild.
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:18.200]   It's Facebook core, www.i.union.
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:31.280]   And the idea really they say is for countries where Facebook is blocked or it would be dangerous
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:32.280]   to use Facebook.
[02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:39.160]   You could now use it anonymously, which is I think pretty interesting and fairly cool.
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:41.160]   That is cool.
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:42.160]   Yeah.
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:48.040]   Facebook core, www.union, but you'll need Torbot on your Android.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.040]   Thanks everybody.
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:50.040]   Hey, thank you, Matt.
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:51.480]   It's actually anonymous.
[02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:52.480]   It's not anonymous.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.480]   It's not anonymous.
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:54.480]   It's logging to Facebook.
[02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:55.480]   So Facebook's going to ask you are.
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:58.720]   Facebook knows who you are, but nobody in between.
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:06.680]   The idea would be that the Amel de Marcos can't see you using Facebook.
[02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:08.960]   Something like that, I don't know why.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:10.840]   That's just the first thing we'll lip to mind.
[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:12.040]   Thank you, Matt Cuts, for being here.
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.680]   I just love it when you're on.
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:14.680]   It is so much fun.
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:16.400]   And thank you for listening to the show too.
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:17.400]   I really appreciate that.
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:18.400]   No.
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:19.400]   Total pleasure.
[02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:20.400]   Always fun to be on.
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:21.400]   Thanks for having me.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:22.400]   Come back anytime.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:23.400]   You have a standing invitation.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:27.640]   As do you, Kevin Marks, because you are also one of my heroes.
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:32.600]   One of the few people who really understands all this stuff and can explain it.
[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:33.760]   Thanks to all of you for joining us.
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:34.760]   We do this week in Google.
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:37.120]   Normally 130 Pacific 430 Eastern.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:38.120]   That's 2,130 UTC.
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:42.880]   I've been in a half an hour late all day and we continue to be half an hour late.
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:44.800]   But if you can watch live, we love it.
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:47.320]   If you can't, you can always get it on demand after the fact.
[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:48.320]   We're going to be doing this for you.
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:49.320]   It's going to be a great year.
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:50.320]   It's going to be a great year.
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:51.320]   And I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:52.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.

[02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:56.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:57.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:58.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:07:59.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:00.320]   It's going to be a great year.
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:01.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:02.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:03.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:03.320 --> 02:08:04.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:05.320]   It's going to be a great year.
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:12.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:16.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:20.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:23.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:26.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:28.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:30.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:32.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:33.320]   I'm going to be doing this for you.
