[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.640]   Great to be back.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.960]   Thanks, Tom Merritt for filling in on the show last week
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.720]   when I was at NAB.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis from Buzzs.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.880]   Machine.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.800]   Buzzy.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.480]   Very fuzzy.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.560]   You're in Toronto.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.280]   That's why it's--
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.080]   Mintrano.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.560]   The entire country is out of focus.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.880]   Many of you--
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.760]   It's the haze in the air from all the cold and moisture.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.920]   Is it cold up there?
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.760]   Still, up in New York where I was 70 and up here,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.920]   I'm wearing two coats.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.120]   I do love Toronto, though.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.720]   I love going up.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.680]   You know what I would like to go to?
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.960]   Is the film festival up there?
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.320]   It's fantastic.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760]   Have you ever been to that?
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.520]   No, I haven't.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.480]   I love that.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.080]   They should do it.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.240]   They should do it north by north-east.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.200]   Instead of a Southwest, do Northwest by northeast.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.760]   I'll talk to Amber.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.200]   It's a great idea.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.040]   Nobody would go because everybody wants to go to Austin.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.560]   You know what's like 90 degrees in Austin today?
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.000]   Speaking of Canada, you're up there by Waterloo,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.440]   which is where RIM is, the Blackberry folks.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.320]   And look what I have in my little hands.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.640]   Here are seven-inch tablets.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.200]   Just came out yesterday.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.000]   It's the Blackberry Playbook.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.760]   I bought this.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.120]   I actually had handled it before because I brought it
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.720]   on to Regis and Kelly.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.920]   This is the 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi edition, which
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.960]   is $4.99 same as an iPad.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.520]   And it's just starting off.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.320]   And look it, I have to update my tablet.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.880]   Again?
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.440]   Again.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.360]   I already did one.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.040]   I guess I have another one.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.160]   What a play.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.280]   First update was 227 megabytes.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.080]   This one says it's 141 megabytes.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.240]   How long has this been out?
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.560]   It came out yesterday.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.640]   OK.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   This is an unusual way to fix these things.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.440]   You know, they realize after they put it out, oh, we want--
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.040]   oh, this is 287 megabytes.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.440]   Well, we'll come back in a couple of days,
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.360]   and we'll take a look.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.000]   We do have somebody asking the chairman, do you have a Zoom?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.240]   We do have a Zoom.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.080]   We've got a Zoom for our all about Android show.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.480]   Jason Howell and Eileen Rivera host that show on Mondays
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.600]   on the channel.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.040]   All about Android covers Android phones, Android tablets,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.320]   Android stuff.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.680]   And I met a great Twitter fan at what
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.600]   used to be recording for the blind and dyslexic is now
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.560]   called Learning Ally.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.560]   And he already is a fan of the Android show.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.640]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.240]   It's really a great show.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.440]   You can get that twit.tv/AAA all about Android.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.000]   And I ordered-- I might get before the show's over--
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I think this is the current hot Android phone.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.120]   It changes every week.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.600]   T-Mobile's G2X, which is basically an LG Optimus 2X,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.080]   Tegra 2 phone, IPS, 4-inch IPS screen.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.360]   And a lot of people are raving about it.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.680]   Cyanogen's already said that he's got one,
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   and he's going to start doing his C7 mod for it.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.560]   So we're going to let Aaa root it because you know what?
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.240]   It comes with FroYo.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.840]   Oh, that was my next question.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.080]   Isn't that sad?
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.640]   Yeah, root that sucker instantly.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.240]   What's the deal?
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.480]   It's a Google experience phone.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   It doesn't have the any LG sugar on top of it.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.080]   But they didn't--
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.040]   They didn't give a gingerbread, which is really strange.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.400]   Well, you--
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.040]   Well, the tab got already the phone.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.680]   Yeah, it's a phone.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.000]   But I'm hearing really from the people who already have it
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.800]   in their hot little hands, I'm hearing very good things.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.880]   So I'm kind of--
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.680]   I've been-- you know, what happened is I had an XSS.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.960]   I like the Google experience phones.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.800]   Those are the vanilla Google phones.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.040]   And Eileen lost hers in New York, so I gave her Austin.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.360]   So I gave her my XSS, which Google had given me,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.720]   so that's fine.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.000]   And then I went back to my Nexus One, which I still--
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.840]   you still use a Nexus One, right, Gina?
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   I am still rocking the Nexus One.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.320]   I am.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.240]   I love, love, except it doesn't have enough memory
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.320]   for applications.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.880]   That's the problem, right?
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.720]   Yep.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.220]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.880]   So I've been drooling kind of over the Nexus S for a while.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.920]   But yeah, no, I just need more room to store stuff on it, right?
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:39.320]   And so I've been really wanting to buy a thunderbolt
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.760]   or something.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.400]   But A, I want the Google experience.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.480]   And B, I'll be honest, I want a dual processor.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.720]   If I'm going to get a new phone, why
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.360]   get a single processor phone, right?
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.200]   So there are a couple of dual processor choices.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.960]   This is the G2X is one.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.880]   There's a Galaxy S4G on Sprint.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.000]   But I think that's single processor also.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.640]   There's the Atrix, which I wasn't going to get,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.520]   because that's AT&T.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.200]   I have enough of them.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.640]   And then I was waiting for the Droid Bionic for Motorola,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.080]   but that's got Motorola blur on it.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.240]   I'm not a fan of blur.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.840]   So as soon as I saw the G2X, I said, OK, good.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.280]   Google experience, dual processor, check, take or two.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.120]   But must jailbreak.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.960]   And not jailbreak, must root, right?
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.640]   Because you don't want to deal with Froyo.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.800]   Well, they say they're going to put gingerbread on it quick,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.680]   but I don't know how quick.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.160]   And you're right.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.880]   And this is a chance for me to let Eileen and Jason
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.560]   ruin my phone.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   So--
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   She loses them.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.600]   She ruins them.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.440]   Boy, you just can't give her a phone.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.400]   Well, that way I own them.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.800]   Look at the matrix that you just laid out
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.440]   of all your decisions about what you wanted their phone
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.400]   and what you would need to do.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.440]   I mean, can you expect a regular consumer
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.320]   to make those decisions, like the Google experience versus blur
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.840]   versus different processors versus the different Froyo,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.400]   gingerbread, honeycomb, even as sort of confusing?
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.760]   I mean--
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.880]   And it's not even like a--
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.520]   There's different plans.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.320]   Well, what I tell people now-- because of course,
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.680]   I talk to normal people.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.920]   Not on this show, ever.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.640]   But on the radio show, that's the normal people show I do.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.760]   And so what I tell them is good news.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.280]   If you wanted a good smartphone, you
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.320]   used to have to use AT&T for an iPhone.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.800]   Now you're going to go AT&T Verizon.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.320]   But I said what you now can do is what you used to do
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.840]   in 2010, pre-2007, which is choose a carrier first, one
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.600]   that you like, one that has good customer service,
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.240]   most importantly, one that has good connectivity where you are.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.440]   If you want 4G, that's a consideration.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.760]   So choose your carrier first.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.560]   And then I think, to be honest, at best,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.520]   there are one or two choices on Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.040]   Verizon.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.480]   It's not like you have eight choices for each.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.980]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.280]   I think starting with the carriers
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.640]   is a really good way to go about.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.920]   That narrows it way down.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.800]   And I think-- and boy, I'll fight to the finish on this one.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.400]   I think having choice is better than no choice.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.320]   I agree.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.360]   I know it confuses people.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.000]   If the-- I mean, you still have choice,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.280]   because you have to choose iPhone or.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.920]   But now this brings up the big story of the week in some ways,
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.840]   Samsung versus Apple.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.760]   Apple says Samsung intentionally designed the Galaxy
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.600]   S to look like an iPhone to confuse consumers down
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.120]   to the Samsung interface, which is a grid icon grid
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.520]   interface, the design of the phone
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.680]   to look like an iPhone with a home button.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.200]   What do you guys think?
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.680]   Marit to this case?
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.240]   If Apple thinks that's what makes the iPhone special,
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.720]   then they're thinking poorly of themselves.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.320]   It's not what makes the iPhone special at all.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.920]   That's interesting.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.040]   But do consumers know that is the question, I guess?
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.360]   It's just another smart phone.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.880]   And all these phones are a bit alike.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.280]   But I think Apple is unique.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.000]   And people, I think, even the real people you talk to on the radio
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.560]   know it's unique.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.520]   That's what I said.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.080]   That's what I said.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.160]   The Neelai Patel, who we had on Twitter this week,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.080]   or no, I'm sorry, Mac Break Weekly yesterday,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.480]   said, no, my mother wouldn't know the difference.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.680]   I think that's really insulting to normal people.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.440]   I think normal people can tell.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.840]   He said, but if you went into Verizon pre-iPhone
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.400]   and said, I want an iPhone, what Verizon would say is,
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.480]   well, we don't have the iPhone, but we have something just
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.600]   like it, which is probably true.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.640]   And they show them an Android phone, probably the Galaxy S.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.240]   Yeah, it goes back to Trio and Blackberry.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.000]   Can you own a whole category?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.840]   Are they going to start trademarking a category now?
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.040]   A patenting a category?
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.840]   It gets to be too much.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.080]   Do you know what about you?
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.640]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.960]   I'm looking at pictures of it right now.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.480]   And it does look a lot like you.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.560]   I have to say.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.400]   But yeah, I mean, this seems just like a total waste of time
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:54.920]   on Apple's part.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.440]   It's true.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.920]   I mean, how many things can you sue over?
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.600]   And there are pretty clear differences.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.400]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.280]   Is my mom going to know the different--
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:05.760]   I don't know.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.160]   Is someone who doesn't use the technology a lot?
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.680]   Does your mom know the difference?
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.600]   Listen, I don't know the difference between some
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.640]   Nissan's and Toyota's.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.160]   Well, in fact, Niele said that this is a very common lawsuit
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.560]   subject in car dress that there's frequent Ferrari
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.000]   shoes all the time for people who imitate their trade dress.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.240]   This is the-- one of the issues was trade dress.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.840]   Now, here is the Galaxy S.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.400]   This is Samsung on top.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.480]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.880]   If you really wanted to hide it.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.080]   But look at-- OK, here's something
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.240]   that maybe-- look at the icons.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.560]   So on the left--
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.160]   on the left, Apple, on the right, Samsung.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.560]   That's going to be fun to do.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.120]   Yeah, the icons on my side is a pretty strong case.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.960]   I got to say.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.120]   A certain blue phone icon.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.360]   I mean, the phone you can give them,
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.920]   but it is green with a gradient.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.040]   I mean, they're close.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.960]   They're pretty darn close.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.200]   The gear in both--
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.480]   I don't know.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.560]   I think this one is--
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.920]   I don't think this is a slam dunk by any means.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.600]   Who knows what a judge and jury are going to say?
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.480]   Apple wants an injunction that forbids them
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.240]   from selling this phone.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.560]   They say that they infringe on patents as well.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.720]   So there's more than just the trade
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.200]   dress and the copyright infringement.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.360]   But I think the crux of it is, would a consumer--
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.760]   I asked him like this, and he agreed--
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.040]   would a consumer be fooled?
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.240]   Was there an intent on Samsung's part
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.320]   to fool or trick users into thinking they were making an eye--
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.640]   something that if it's not an iPhone, at least,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.960]   it's just like an iPhone?
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.200]   I agree with you.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.000]   I think nobody's fooled by this.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.440]   And it's a--
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.520]   It's the serious form of flattery.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.680]   I mean, Apple should be standing out there and saying,
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.600]   we're way ahead.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.560]   Everybody wants to copy.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.640]   Of course they do.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.160]   You agree, Gina?
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:11:59.680]   I do.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.120]   I do.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.560]   And this is Apple's whole thing, right?
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.840]   Like, fire up your copy machines.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.200]   Wasn't that one of their ads?
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.680]   A formal mackerel.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.840]   I mean, yeah, exactly.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.200]   Since here's form of flattery.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.880]   And this is what happens when you
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.960]   have a successful product, other products borrow ideas from them.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.280]   Well, remember, Apple sued Microsoft over the trash can.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.160]   The Microsoft called it a recycle bin,
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160]   but it was--
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.360]   Right, clearly the trash.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.640]   And they lost.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.720]   Now, Neelike says it was a flawed suit,
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.480]   and they know better now about how to pursue such a thing.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.800]   But I think that a court's going to say, no, this
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.040]   is how technology innovation happens.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.960]   Somebody comes up with an idea, the idea, perhaps,
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.160]   to have a touch screen that fills the front of the phone.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.840]   And it makes sense.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.720]   And everybody else does it.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.640]   Somebody has a home.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.360]   The funny thing is the Samsung does not have just a home
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.880]   button.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.600]   It has a middle button.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.680]   But it has, as all Android phones do,
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.960]   it has other buttons down the bottom.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.400]   Yeah, there's a grid of icons.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.960]   But that kind of makes sense.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.600]   If you're going to have icons, what are you going to do?
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.080]   Put them in a circle.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.680]   Of course, I should point out Microsoft
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.960]   didn't with Windows Phone 7.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.680]   They were very careful not to do this grid.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.080]   I--
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.720]   That's true.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.080]   But the home screen, by default, the pictures I'm looking at,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.320]   I mean, you can do widgets.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.520]   It's not just the plain grid of icons.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.080]   Oh, by--
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.640]   Oh, but the Samsung--
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.320]   It's the Samsung sugar.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.720]   So that's the thing is that, yes, you're right,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.600]   vanilla Android.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.480]   The phone I'm getting, Samsung Galaxy Nexus S
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.160]   will be widgets and all that stuff.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.720]   But the Samsung UI does look a lot like--
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.640]   Right.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.480]   Right.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.560]   Mm.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.280]   I don't think there's merit, but this stuff takes 10 years.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.040]   And it definitely has--
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.600]   I don't employ a lot of lawyers.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.720]   Well, the funny thing is Samsung is--
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.000]   Apple's literally--
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.880]   Samsung is Apple's biggest supplier.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.640]   They make the A5 chip in the iPad.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.120]   They make the A4 chip in the iPhone.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.120]   They make all this SSDs in the RAM and all this stuff.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   It's kind of funny.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.720]   It's interesting.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.200]   You think about--
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.640]   It'd be a suicidal and they can't do it,
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.440]   but it'd be fun if they just said, OK, fine, cut off Apple
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.680]   and cut off their air supply for a month or two
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.440]   to fund new suppliers.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.320]   Well, and this was something that Nilai said also
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.600]   is that it has to do with the structure of Samsung.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.560]   Because it's a big Korean koretsu,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.120]   each division is almost autonomous.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.280]   So in fact, the phone division has
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.520]   to bid for processors from the processor division
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.480]   against Apple.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.560]   So the processor division is not going
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.040]   to shoot themselves in the foot.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.080]   They're going to continue to do business.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.960]   I think it's interesting.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.680]   I don't like it.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.880]   Moving on.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.560]   Yeah, I think Compete, don't litigate,
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.080]   is just-- seems like that's the right way to go.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.160]   It's the American way.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.520]   No, actually, litigation is American way.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.600]   Let's be honest.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.160]   Let's be completely honest.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.840]   It depends on what you're talking to, I guess.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   The idealist versus the realist.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.720]   Hey, I'm going to-- we're going to take a break for an app,
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.680]   but I want to ask you guys-- I'm going to give you a minute
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.760]   as I do the ad to think about-- to help me out.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.380]   So the G8 is coming up in May in Doville, France,
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.120]   President Sarkozy, the host of this.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.880]   And he is convening, a couple of days
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.960]   before the 24th and 25th of May, a blue
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.400]   renovating the panel of internet entrepreneurs
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.200]   to create a white paper for the G8 Summit
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.960]   on how government should treat the internet, particularly
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.760]   the government and the internet and the economy.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.600]   Wow.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.360]   Wow.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.680]   We know Eric Schmidt's been invited, Mark Zuckerberg's
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.400]   been invited for some reason that I still haven't quite
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.040]   figured out I was invited.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.560]   Wow.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.920]   Congratulations, Leo.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.760]   So I'm--
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.520]   That's awesome.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.880]   That is amazing.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.400]   Yeah, well--
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.600]   I'm really glad you're going to have a seat at that table.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.760]   It was bizarre, but I am too, because I
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.000]   think that the existing big business has an entrenched
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.520]   interest in the status quo.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.760]   Look at Google Verizon.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.840]   And I want to step up and say, look,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.640]   if you want innovation, if you want an economic future,
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.680]   you can't let the entrenched interests determine your policy.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.680]   They've already made it.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.000]   Don't let them pull the ladder up.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.200]   The future of your country, of our country,
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.960]   of all the G8 countries relies on an open internet
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.800]   which to encourage innovation, to encourage fluid friction-free
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.200]   economy.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.680]   This is vitally important.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.960]   So yes, I know it's the tendency of a national, of a government,
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.560]   to look to the current business for guidance.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.760]   But your stakeholders include the future.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.920]   And maybe even more importantly include the future.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.760]   And don't forget that when you consider it an amen brother.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.160]   So anyway, I just said what I thought I might say,
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   but I'd love to get your--
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.320]   Well, where is it, Leo?
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.840]   May 20-- I have to find the invitation.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.760]   On the 24th and 25th, it's a Tuesday and Wednesday.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.080]   So I won't be here for Twig.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.120]   But if I can, I will report back.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.840]   I got the-- it's kind of mind-boggling.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.120]   I got the schedule.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.080]   First of all, I get a letter in French from Nicholas Sarkozy.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.320]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.040]   That is really cool.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.960]   Borschuleo?
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.280]   Yeah, I'm framing that.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.240]   And at the end, it says, my rough translation.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.040]   I hope you will take this as a measure of my esteem.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.120]   I cannot figure this out.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.720]   I think somebody like Cedric Ingrann,
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.680]   at Planet Crenn or somebody in France, maybe Loeke Le Mer.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.400]   I think it's Loeke.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.880]   Loeke was an advisor to Sarkozy.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.520]   And Loeke is going.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.320]   So actually, I thought it was a hoax.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.040]   This is how little I think of myself.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.440]   I thought, oh, yeah, April Fool's a little late.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.640]   Yeah, Loeke is messing with me.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.240]   So I emailed Loeke.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.280]   I said, do you know anything about this?
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.560]   He said, yes, for real.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.200]   I'm going.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.000]   See you there.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.280]   Nice.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.280]   So I made my reservation.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.960]   I'm going to try to bring my daughter who lived in France
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.400]   for a year and who is even more than I
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.160]   represent the future, a 19-year-old who is like your son, Jake,
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.840]   who is the real stakeholder here.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.720]   Let's not mortgage their future for Verizon, Google,
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.280]   the record industry, the movie industry.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.600]   So anyway, yeah, I'm really so excited,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.560]   but I'm also completely intimidated and terrified.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.600]   Apparently Zuckerberg has been invited to Schmidt.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.000]   Jeff Bezos.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.680]   Here's the thing, Loeke.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.240]   You're the representative of the people.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.440]   They're all the same companies.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.160]   That's what I'm going to try to say.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   I'm a small company, but more than--
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.400]   No, that's what I'm going to try to say.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.120]   I come here.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.000]   My portfolio is to represent the people, the people who
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.760]   use the internet.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.200]   And furthermore, I mean, there are plenary sessions,
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.120]   but there's working groups.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.240]   We break off into groups.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.480]   We create a recommendation.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.520]   This isn't just like, hey, hey, you're doing
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.600]   have a cocktail party and a shake Carla Brunet's hand.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.720]   This is really a working two days in which we're
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.160]   supposed to create a recommendation for the G8 Summit.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.120]   Eric Schmidt, Jimmy Wells, Jack Ma, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos,
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.640]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.120]   Look at you.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.360]   No, it's some horrible mistake was made.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.640]   I am not worthy to be on this Skype call right now.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.480]   No, no, no.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.400]   Not worthy.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.680]   No, that's awesome, Leo.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.560]   I'm so proud of you.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.560]   That's awesome.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.360]   It's one of those things where I go, oh, forget it.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.200]   I'm not going to that.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.920]   But I feel a real obligation--
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.200]   As you should.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.880]   --to speak up for us.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.320]   So I don't know if I'm the right person to do it,
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.320]   but I got tapped.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.600]   So I'm going to do it.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.040]   And I'm going to send you--
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.080]   with your permission, I'm going to send you
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.160]   my manuscript for the last two chapters or--
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.680]   Oh, I would love that.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.320]   I mean, I really-- please, any--
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.240]   I want to hear from you.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.840]   Tell me what I should say.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.240]   Some of you have heard here on this show.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.360]   But yeah, this is important.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:48.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.800]   Well, thank God I've been doing this show for the last year
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.160]   and a half.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.000]   I think I've learned a little bit from you, too.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.840]   God.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.560]   I think you should try to recruit two guests.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.440]   I think that should be your main mission.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.080]   Hey, Phil, you want to be on Twitter?
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.600]   It's a show, but it's great.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.520]   Hey, Jeff, we talk about you a lot.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.520]   Come on, a show.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.020]   I'm in.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:05.880]   I was just calling.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.380]   Come on.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:06.880]   You're going to say--
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   It's going to be this--
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.720]   It's going to be this--
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.400]   It's going to be this--
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.360]   There's this podcaster here who keeps trying to keep people in.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.400]   See that guy with the gray hair?
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.520]   Stay away from him.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.880]   Really pushy.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.840]   Did you hear that guy with a happy voice?
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.400]   Ooh, what's with him?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.360]   Who let him in?
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.920]   This is all about Jeff in creating disruption.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.640]   Creating frameworks in which disruption can happen.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.160]   It can happen.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.720]   Innovation can happen, right?
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.280]   That's where you want to go with this.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.560]   Jarvis is your man.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.160]   I just know.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.960]   I end the book with a quote from Schmidt.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.680]   I think it's a go-by side on him,
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.600]   but just saying that he blushes that the fact
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.440]   the internet was made such that 24-year-olds in a garage
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.920]   could do what they did.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.440]   Yes.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.000]   And it was Larry and Sergey, but it's not anymore.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.320]   And who's the next?
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.480]   Exactly.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.880]   And I just feel like I walk in the door
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.720]   and the master control will say,
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.120]   he's not any kind of put-a-crat sock.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.920]   He's a user.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.880]   Throw me out.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.600]   Put-a-crats only in here.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.320]   Hand is it'll be worth the whole trip.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.120]   What's your bank balance, son?
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.360]   Elio, can you kiss Carly Bruelly's hand?
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.160]   Well, my daughter, who's very excited, of course,
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.160]   said, well, she didn't say, well, I meet Sarkozy.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.960]   She said, well, I meet Carla.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.920]   I've been pledged to get Carla's autograph for Tom Merritt,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.480]   believe it or not.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.280]   He's a big fan.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.720]   That's too much information, Leo.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.040]   Well, no.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.440]   I know.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.600]   Glee's one thing, but Carla, Brunet.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.960]   I see-- see, again, with my mouth, Nicholas, I'm sorry.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.360]   I love her.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:40.960]   She's beautiful.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.600]   She's wonderful.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.160]   I love her singing.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.200]   Well, yeah, I tried.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.080]   It's fun for her.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.240]   It's just scary to be about your--
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.160]   I'm going to get uninvited.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.000]   We need to get those headphones back in her ears
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.480]   to make you do the four minutes of silent.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.120]   We've got those photos stuck us up again.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.960]   And we'll try to shut up for the next month
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.480]   so that they don't know we've let us subversive in.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.320]   Hey, let's talk a little bit about FreshBooks,
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.240]   and then we will continue.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.080]   And I would like to get your advice, frankly,
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.640]   because I don't-- I am not worthy, believe me.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.760]   FreshBooks, of course, the easy online invoicing service
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.960]   that I first found out about in 2004.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.560]   That's when they started Amber MacArthur
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.600]   was a big fan of Toronto company, Jeff, actually.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.240]   And that's how she knew about them.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.080]   She knew them.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.200]   And of course, since 2004, I and 2 million other folks
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.160]   have used FreshBooks to change our lives.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.960]   If you're a freelancer, an independent contractor,
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.120]   if you have to invoice to get paid--
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.720]   I got the wrong lower third up.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.520]   Let me just put this up.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.640]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.520]   There you go.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.080]   They're both blue.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.240]   That's with full-made FreshBooks.com
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.480]   is the way to do your invoicing.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.840]   Look, we all hate invoicing.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.800]   Everybody's ever invoicing.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.720]   It's just a pain in the butt.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.360]   But here's the deal.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.040]   You upload your logo.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.600]   They actually have automated invoicing, which is fantastic.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.760]   They'll automatically send it out.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.120]   And you can even if your client agrees,
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.960]   have automatic payment, which is--
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.520]   most clients would agree to that,
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.320]   because they don't want it.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.560]   It's just as hard for them to do all the payments
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.520]   as it is for you to do the invoicing.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.240]   That's why they love those emails from FreshBooks users,
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.800]   because there's just a button on there that says,
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.200]   "Pay it now with a credit card or one of 11 authorized payment
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.600]   services like Paypal, authorized.net, to go."
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   And if they don't pay automated, late payment reminders,
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.880]   which make it easy to collect.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.880]   There are clients I know who still want paper invoices.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.200]   They do that too.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.040]   And they even have FreshBooks on your iPhone
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.800]   or on your desktop so that you can track hours
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.160]   and then automatically put them right into the invoice.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.280]   So many great features.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.720]   And now you can try it free.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.040]   Free for the first three clients.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.160]   Go to freshbooks.com and sign up today.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.000]   Free forever for the first three clients.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.400]   I think for a lot of us, that's all we ever need.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   FreshBooks.com makes invoicing easy, easy peasy.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.400]   You gotta use, I'm sure you still
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.520]   let send out invoices right, Gina?
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.720]   Occasionally, although I'm pretty full-time now.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.560]   Really?
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.400]   I think up?
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.280]   Yeah, expert labs, it has come my full-time gig.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.800]   So I'm not invoicing as much.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   But yeah, I would definitely do FreshBooks
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.720]   if I was 1099ing a lot.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.920]   So much easier.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.520]   I mean, I need to get my wife to take over my invoicing
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.360]   'cause I'm terrible at it.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.160]   And maybe if I can get FreshBooks,
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.640]   maybe I'll convince her to do it.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.480]   She'll do it.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.320]   I mean, it's actually, it's--
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.160]   Well, she does.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.000]   You don't want me.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.840]   It's really fun.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.600]   Did you see that Eric Schmidt,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.000]   besides the fact that he's no longer the CEO of Google,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.400]   got a raise, he was earning a dollar a year.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.600]   Is this a number?
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.720]   Yeah, it was a, no, it's not.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.960]   What have been, it's not.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.240]   Yeah, it was the percentage increase there.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.600]   I won't say.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.440]   It was not a number.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.600]   It's not a number, it's okay.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.240]   He was earning a dollar a year.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.720]   Of course, because he's an owner,
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.240]   he's one of the wealthiest men in the world.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.000]   He doesn't really need to get a salary.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.360]   Steve Jobs did the same thing.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.800]   But he's going to get a raise.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.640]   What is it?
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.640]   (laughs)
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.400]   To $1.25 million, what is the percentage?
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.040]   (laughs)
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.760]   That is a raise.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.720]   You need a big calculator to do that
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   with a potential $6 million bonus.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.440]   So I just think that I,
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:18.000]   I've been talking to people, he was kicked upstairs.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.840]   But it's pretty clear by Larry Page
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.120]   'cause the first thing Larry does
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.200]   is create a new gang of six.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.960]   Marissa Meyer, not a member.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.600]   And this is his little hair.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.560]   I disagree and agree at the same time Leo.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.520]   Well, you know more than I do.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.360]   You've been inside.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.040]   No, I don't know much more than you do at all.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.600]   But when I saw him,
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.360]   he nodded at what I'd written about this.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.680]   I do think that we forgot, as I said on the show before,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.360]   that it was always his job to prepare.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.240]   He was the Prince Regent preparing Larry.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.360]   And it is their company.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.880]   It's not his company.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.920]   And so once that happens, once Larry is really in charge,
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.400]   then he's got to be really in charge.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.600]   And yeah, Eric stole there and Eric's on the board
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.560]   and Eric has to have advice.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.920]   But Larry, I think the key to Larry's reign
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.960]   is that he had to put his own team in.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.440]   I guess so.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.000]   I guess so.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.440]   I guess he was in agreement from the beginning.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.280]   We're going to bring in the dad to kind of bring up Larry.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.440]   And that's what Eric tweeted is, okay,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.440]   time for the original.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.840]   It's over.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.200]   Right.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.120]   Okay.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.560]   That's a nice raise though, that's for sure.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.760]   Well, it's on top of the stock as well.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.320]   On top of a $100 million stock grant,
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.120]   of course, he can't get that money for till 2015.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.280]   So they just want to make sure he's not on the street,
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.440]   that he makes sure he comes to the board meetings
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.480]   with shine shoes in a nicely pressed suit.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.240]   So just a little--
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.840]   You're not here, you're getting the same percentage here,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.160]   a tweet.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.960]   It's a little walking around money for Eric.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.360]   I'll put on a tie for that, Leo.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.840]   You start off higher than he did,
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.440]   so it's going to be really great.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.000]   Yeah, his percentage is actually more
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.400]   because he started solo.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.320]   We saw Scoble took pictures of.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.000]   There was a lot of press on the Facebook,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.960]   the new Facebook Open Server Farm thing.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.000]   Google's also planning.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.160]   A little investment, $100 million investment,
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.200]   and a wind farm.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.840]   There have been complaints about the Facebook
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.040]   operation center up in Oregon
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.680]   because it's running basically on power from coal-fired plants.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.880]   That's good.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.520]   That and Mark Zuckerberg's dog beast took a pee on the floor.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.680]   Oh, no, that's green.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.040]   That is green.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.160]   Which was on the beast's Facebook page.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.160]   I got my dog with me.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.200]   Aussie's with me right now.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:35.640]   I don't know.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.640]   Real Aussie on camera.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.520]   Aussie do not be inspired.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.440]   He's sleeping.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.600]   Let sleeping dogs-- what does they say about sleeping dogs?
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.800]   Tell him troops.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.600]   Tell no tales.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.040]   That's right.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.520]   Aussie, I'll show him later.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.960]   Once the playbook is updated, he might want to play with that
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.320]   for a little bit.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.760]   This has happened several times.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.320]   Unable to download software update.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.080]   What's up with that?
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.560]   I don't know.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.120]   It keeps trying.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.280]   It's downloaded some stuff, but these
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.920]   are hundreds of megabytes.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.960]   Have you even set up the network for it?
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.000]   Yeah, the first thing you have to do is plug it in,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.320]   because it's got some power.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.520]   But there's a plug of this in and then get on your Wi-Fi,
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.640]   which I did.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.400]   And maybe our Wi-Fi is-- I don't know.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.280]   Maybe it's our Wi-Fi.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.040]   But this is-- I mean, literally, at least two 200 plus megabyte
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.720]   updates before I can even use this thing.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.040]   So popular, everybody's downloading at the same time?
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.680]   Maybe.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.720]   Maybe.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.400]   I think we don't talk enough about how environmentally
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   expensive our internet uses.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.280]   But every Google search uses energy.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.920]   And to Google's credit, this is from a CNET screen tech
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.240]   called Martin Lomonica.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.600]   To Google's credit, they're trying
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.960]   to find sustainable energy sources.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   They will invest $100 million in the Shepherds Flat Wind
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.840]   Project in Oregon.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.520]   Everything's in Oregon.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.720]   This is the second investment in renewable energy
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.040]   in the last two weeks.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.880]   It would be enough energy for 235,000 average US homes.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.680]   Now, the Facebook network operation centers,
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.360]   I think they put two or three online.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.160]   Each is using enough power for a town of 40,000 people.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.800]   They also invested $186 million in a solar power plant
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.840]   last week.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.000]   So--
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.080]   Yeah, and Google.org is one of its three main causes
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.640]   is energy, and they fully acknowledge
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.920]   that it's in their best interest.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.000]   They can get the cost of clean, renewable energy
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.640]   to be cheaper than coal.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.120]   It's hugely beneficial to Google, and of course,
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.800]   to all mankind.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.640]   And Google can afford this.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.960]   Yes.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.280]   It's an investment in their future and our future,
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.440]   interest are aligned.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.760]   This is where it's very rare.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.360]   There's a nexus in between corporate profit interests
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.320]   and our interests.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.240]   And I think it's great.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.400]   Yeah, it's great for business and for marketing for them, too.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.080]   It makes them look like the good guys, for sure.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.000]   All right.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.720]   They did pretty well this quarter,
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.600]   although the stock market spanked Larry Page.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.640]   Apparently, they wanted Larry to come on and explain.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:15.360]   Explain to me, Larry, why costs were up so much.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.200]   He just came on and said, hey, and left without answering
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.280]   questions.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.520]   And the stock took a little news dive,
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.520]   even though Google announced $8.58 billion in revenue
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.240]   in the first quarter.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.640]   That's a 27% increase year to year.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:41.320]   And a net income of profit of $2.3 billion,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:47.000]   that's only a mere modest gain of $700 million
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.480]   over the first quarter 2010.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.400]   Oh.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.280]   But the real issue, and I think the reason the stock took a hit
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.360]   first was that the analysts predicted more.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:01.120]   Second was, expenses were up 33%.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.880]   And one guess on that is personnel.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.960]   They hired 2,000 employees this quarter.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.400]   They hired a lot and they're having to pay a lot.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.360]   Right, they're paying for top talent, right?
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.280]   And all those ice cream sandwiches and gingerbread men
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.240]   for Android releases, right?
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.880]   Well, and all the money that reportedly they're giving
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.120]   people who Twitter or Facebook's trying to steal
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.080]   to stick around.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.040]   Right, to stick around.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.720]   Yeah, they're competing, right?
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.880]   With Facebook and Twitter for the best top talent.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.040]   They're so they're offering a lot of money.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.400]   Bank.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.040]   Yep.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.320]   Bank.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.400]   I offered Eileen $5 not to go back to CNET.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.200]   She stuck around?
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.840]   Well, she hasn't told me yet.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.440]   Here's the number I thought.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.240]   I can't do any stories with numbers in them.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:51.800]   Yes, you can.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.400]   The numbers on there already already have a number.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   Oh, well, let me look at the top.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.520]   That's one you'd never guessed, so it's fine.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.680]   Oh, I'll look at the doc.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.440]   That's what I should do.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.960]   Oh, yeah, we're safe here.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.440]   You're safe.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:31:59.800]   We do a little doc.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   You're so, so safe.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.320]   It's a strong number.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.920]   Oh, that's a good number.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.280]   I like it.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.880]   So I'll mention this number then.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:11.560]   350,000 Android handsets being activated every day.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.760]   So that's-- what is that?
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.800]   15 times 700 is 7.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.680]   I mean, it's almost a million a month, right?
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680]   Or no.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.280]   Leo's responsible for 500 per day.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.000]   10 million a month.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.960]   And I do my share.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.200]   I do my share.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.700]   I do.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.600]   I got a new one coming today.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.200]   I'll activate.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.360]   I'll be one of those 350,000 people activating today.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.520]   It'll be a lot easier to activate than that blackberry thing.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.080]   Look, new software is available.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.080]   Wow.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.600]   Look, it's a few more megabytes to download.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.320]   No.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.520]   So close.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.800]   I've got 221 megabytes of 287.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.640]   So close.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.840]   So app downloads are up 50% in fourth quarter too.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.280]   So this is-- I mean, look, there's just
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.280]   no question that Android's on a rampage, which
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.880]   may be why Apple is so anxious to go after Samsung.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.720]   Maybe this is the beginning of a jihad against all Android
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.200]   devices.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:04.720]   I don't know.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.000]   Yeah, somebody pointed out their sidesteped Google in that.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.720]   But I think a lot of--
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.800]   they took the easy one because they're
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.600]   going after much more direct.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.680]   Trade dress infringement on the part.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.440]   And they're going after somebody for whom
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.640]   they are a huge customer.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.160]   But Apple has--
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.520]   What's the--
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.160]   Samsung that I do, but sit down and self-flagellate.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.520]   Right.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.720]   And Apple has said that they do believe that Android--
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.360]   haven't they--
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.520]   and Linux violate some of their patents.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.120]   I know Microsoft has said that.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.160]   I can't keep track.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.760]   Leo, so someone calling himself Chipotle and Twitter,
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.920]   otherwise known as Chip Clark--
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.040]   I don't think he works there--
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.680]   says about your summit.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.400]   Hopefully, Leo equals FDR and not Neville Chamberlain.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.840]   The responsibility is on you, sir.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.040]   I shall not bring a furled umbrella and a bowler hat to--
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.520]   And people are saying in Twitter,
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.440]   Leo is, after all, the president of the internet.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.240]   I think that's what happened.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.560]   I said they saw my about me page and they got confused.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.000]   Oh, that was--
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.160]   I can hear some of these.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   It's a promotion.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:11.360]   Yes.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.720]   Have that French gentleman lost something.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.480]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.400]   Where's your Air Force One?
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.240]   Ah, sorry.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.920]   I came economy class on Delta.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.800]   Have you seen the price of flying to Paris?
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.120]   Short notice in May?
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.800]   Oh, I can't even imagine.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.600]   Mr. Sarkozy did not offer me a ticket.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.480]   That's all right.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.520]   I'm going to see if I can hit you right with Eric.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.720]   You should go-- yeah, that's good idea, actually.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   If there are any CEOs listening who are flying in their G8s to the G8--
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.960]   Can I hit your ride?
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.720]   Use this stand out on the private jet airfield.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.960]   Hey, you're going to the EGA?
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.720]   Need a lift?
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.960]   I think you should go on Kickstarter and send Leo to France.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.720]   I'll get the internet.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.720]   Send Leo to France.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.960]   You know, the people who give you money
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.000]   get a special report from Leo.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.720]   But incidentally, we've applied to Kickstarter.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.760]   I don't know if they'll accept this,
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.880]   but we have applied to Kickstarter
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.760]   to raise money for our new studio.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.400]   Ah.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.160]   Oh, right on.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.040]   I thought that seemed like an appropriate use of funds.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.600]   And this way, our community knows there's a direct connection.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.040]   And we've got some-- you have to give premiums.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.000]   It's like a public radio.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.840]   So I think for $100 donation, we're
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.120]   going to have your name on a brick on the brick wall.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.920]   Which, when you're mad, you'll pull it out and throw it
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.120]   at somebody.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.000]   Your brick might be used to being Tom Merritt.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.160]   It'll be amazing.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.520]   I lead you, lost another phone.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.440]   When I say you bricked my phone, I mean you,
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.960]   bricked my phone.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.880]   Oh, well, that's a better idea, Leo.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.440]   The wall of Leo phones, you give me one.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.480]   Actually, you know what we should add that?
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.680]   For a donation, you can have one of Leo's old--
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.840]   you know, a piece of junk that Leo's going to use.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.280]   And Leo's hand sets and a lot of graphic.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:11.880]   That's a good idea.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.400]   Nice.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.240]   That was a good idea.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.840]   I'm flying around.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.320]   Old stuff.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.600]   Maybe this playbook, if it doesn't update itself,
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.120]   this could go straight to Gazelle.com.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.160]   Insta-brick.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.160]   Insta-brick.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:26.800]   Maybe it's us.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.720]   That's what you go on.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.400]   Yeah, maybe it's us.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   Well, I'll keep trying.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:37.680]   So this afternoon, President Obama will be at Facebook.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.360]   And at the same time, Eric Schmidt's going to interview Tina Fey.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.040]   Just to love that.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.600]   So Zuck gets Obama.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.880]   Schmidt gets Fey.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.720]   Which are you going to watch?
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.600]   They're both going to be awkward as hell.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.960]   That's the beauty part of it.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:02.080]   I mean, just-- obviously Marissa had-- it was Gaga over Gaga.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.840]   I mean, I've got to crush on Tina Fey.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.280]   I think Tina Fey's magnificent, right?
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.880]   Oh, agreed.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.380]   Right?
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.880]   So you can just imagine Eric Schmidt, who
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.920]   must have a crush on her if he's taken this duty.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.280]   That's going to be hilarious.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.960]   I want to hear him giggle like Marissa did before Gaga.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.460]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.720]   I think this was maybe part of his severance package.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.960]   I get to interview Tina Fey.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.400]   That is a really awesome, awesome interview.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.600]   And then when he's at the G8, he gets to meet Carla Bruni.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.160]   Whoa.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.480]   They sent him.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.040]   So let me see.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.680]   Actually, I think the president is speaking right now.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.040]   Is he always doing a town hall meeting?
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.600]   Is this-- I mean, wow.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.920]   This has really become-- the Facebook has become the town hall.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.580]   Or is that a bad thing?
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.600]   Well, the journalism professor in me should get all hotty
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.080]   and say, well, they're not journalists.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.320]   They don't know what to ask for.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.240]   But bull, I think this is just the point.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.680]   Larry Lessick has a really good new Larry Lessick PowerPoint up.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.160]   And Larry has his--
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.040]   I love his.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.280]   --way to do with this magnificent.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.760]   And it's very, very good.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.080]   And he was talking about the architecture
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.320]   and how we try to regulate the wrong things, the wrong ways,
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   and about how the architecture acts.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.920]   And the architect-- you know, his code is law.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.280]   And he just broadened it.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.600]   And it occurred to me that what Andy Carvin
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.240]   might bring up every other week,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.320]   remotely every week, every third week.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.040]   But Andy Carvin and P.R., what we're seeing
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.920]   is news starting to be architected like the internet,
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.120]   end to end, that the powers of the edges, right?
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.080]   The witnesses can speak directly to the public.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.800]   And if a journalist wants to be in the middle
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.000]   and do the ads, the value fine.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   But in a sense, I think Obama, going to Facebook
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.960]   is symbolically like him being online
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.120]   and is a bit of internet architecture.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.000]   It's edge to edge.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   Plus, I like that Silicon Valley technology
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.040]   should be seen as a very important consistency.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:06.680]   I agree.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.560]   Politicians to come and kowtow too.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.880]   Well, you know what they usually do.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.920]   In fact, Obama's done it.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.240]   Is they go to the CEOs and they have fundraisers
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.040]   and they talk to them.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.200]   So I do like the idea that he--
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.320]   at least if he's going to go to Facebook,
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.000]   it's not just to talk to Zuck.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   It's to talk to everybody.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.960]   God, I wish he'd worn a hoodie.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.440]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.640]   Mark Zuckerberg is wearing a white shirt and a tie.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.360]   Oh.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.160]   I hope they show him again.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.680]   They haven't shown his footwear yet.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.520]   You wear a suit for the president.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.480]   I think you better.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.080]   Period.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.280]   Yeah, I think you better.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.400]   Yeah, this is cool.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.240]   This is going on right now.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.080]   Look at that.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.520]   So you're saying that I should probably
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.360]   get a suit for the trip to France?
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.880]   I think so.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.880]   OK.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   I think so.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.400]   I think you should have an internet uniform.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.680]   Battle ribbons on it.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.200]   Right through to your Microsoft ribbon.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.040]   I'm the president of the internet.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:02.840]   Here's Zuck.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.120]   There he is on a stool.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.320]   He looks like he's wearing a--
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.120]   10-ies, though.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.080]   Doesn't look like he's wearing--
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.400]   can I rewind this in any way?
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.720]   I guess not.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.480]   Guess you're not allowed to rewind the president.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.360]   But they showed him.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.760]   Yeah, it looks like he's wearing sneaks.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.960]   But--
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.520]   You should admit on what Tina Fey at this very moment.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.720]   Apple's earning call is in about 45--
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.080]   No, it's right now.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.080]   This will be the first time an Apple earning call
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.800]   is pretty much ignored by the tech press.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.400]   Let's see.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.720]   So where would I find Eric Schmidt and Tina Fey would have been?
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.400]   No.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.840]   I can tell you one place that won't be Google Video.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.800]   We tried to get somebody from Google Video on.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.120]   And what did Karen Wickry say?
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.280]   They're otherwise occupied.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.240]   They're what?
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.400]   They're busy regrouping.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.280]   I think-- I understand why you've got YouTube.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.280]   You don't need Google Video.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   In fact, I probably could--
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.320]   I'm on record saying, what's the deal?
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.120]   But I like Google Video.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.680]   There was no-- you didn't have the same time limits.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.920]   There was some great documentaries.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.160]   What I don't understand is why they couldn't just
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.160]   port the videos over to YouTube for you.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.840]   I heard a thought-- oh, here's Zuckin's tie, by the way.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.280]   Oh, actually, he's got a nice black tie.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.680]   He's rolled up his sleeves.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.360]   Oh, look.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.200]   The president's going to roll up his sleeve too.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.160]   Look, he's mirroring the Zuck.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.520]   We have tie parity.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.200]   Oh, my.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.520]   He's loosened his tie.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.720]   Zuck looks like such a grown up in a tie.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.480]   Good job, Mark.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.440]   Infrastructure and clean energy.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.320]   So my question to start off is, what specifically
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.240]   do you think we should do?
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.520]   And what specifically do you think we can cut
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.320]   in order to make this all out of?
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.400]   Well, let me first of all, Mark, share with you--
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.040]   So roll up my sleeves.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.360]   And then--
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.880]   I think a lot of my thoughts.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.440]   Yeah, loosen the tie.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.680]   Understand that it's a problem, but aren't
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.760]   sure how it came about.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.920]   In 2000, at the end of the year--
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.960]   You can watch this yourself, kids, if you want to see it.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.480]   I'm not going to--
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.440]   But we actually had a--
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.720]   We have a show to do.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.600]   I'm sorry, Mr. President.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.800]   And that was in part--
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.240]   I'll see you endovial.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.120]   I'm sorry, Mr. President.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.920]   We're with the real president.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.080]   We are with the president.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.840]   I'm sure what you have to say is important.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.440]   We eat continent, the future, man.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.440]   But we've got to talk about--
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.160]   We're the old world, Obama.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.200]   Where can I find--
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.960]   Where can I find--
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.280]   Would you see Chatham, if you can find Eric Schmidt talking
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.480]   to Tina Fey?
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.880]   Chatham could find it.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.280]   Chatham will find it.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.240]   They can find anything.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.920]   They'll find it.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.760]   They say Google it.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.760]   Chatham, Chatham.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.280]   Google it.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.040]   You did find it.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.880]   It looks like they're taking questions via moderator,
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.880]   but they're no longer taking those questions.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.880]   Is this for the president or Tina Fey?
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.360]   Sorry, Tina Fey.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.360]   So if you get a youtube.com/addgoogletalks,
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.200]   it just says this is going on today,
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.800]   and we're no longer accepting questions.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.400]   So they must be recording it, and then we're going to edit it
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.640]   together and probably put it published later.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.160]   Did they do the same thing with Gaga, didn't they?
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.880]   Yeah, I think that's how it worked with Gaga.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.680]   Just in case, Eric giggles.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.880]   Or says something's creepy either way.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.560]   So I mean, Tina's do--
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.840]   Chatham new book just came out, right?
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.840]   Yeah, bossy pants.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.640]   So that must be what this is--
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.840]   Did I say the greatest book blurb in history?
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.360]   Book blurb is worth it.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.640]   Signed trees.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.280]   She's too damn funny.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.680]   She is so funny.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.280]   Do you watch "30 Rock"?
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.280]   Oh, "Love 30 Rock."
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.200]   "Love 30 Rock."
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.000]   It's what's consistently original, which is why I like it.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.480]   It's not-- it's very unpredictable.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.800]   It's as if 20 very funny monkeys wrote it.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.560]   I mean, it goes all over the place.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.680]   You know, sometimes it's non sequitur,
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.280]   sometimes it's word play, sometimes it's a pun.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.880]   But you just never know where they're going to go with anything.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.440]   And the throw-- yeah, somebody--
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.600]   Lennon in the chatroom saying the throw away jokes.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.120]   That's-- they just--
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:43:59.680]   They're her.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.600]   Out of the side of the mouth.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   And you go, what?
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:02.860]   What?
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.600]   And then you pause it.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.560]   And then I pause it and laugh.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.600]   And then I play again.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.360]   So what did we say?
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.440]   We said Google had $8.58 billion in gross revenue,
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.120]   $2.3 net income.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.400]   Apple announced-- and this earnings
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.400]   called going on right now--
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:24.960]   $24.67 billion in revenue, 10 times more.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:30.920]   And a profit of $5.99, almost three times the net.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.320]   Wow.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:33.840]   Wow.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.840]   So really expensive hardware.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.720]   Unbelievable.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.920]   Yeah, wow.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.160]   Good for Apple.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.040]   Hey.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.000]   So the reason I think, Jeff, that they-- to get back
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.680]   to Google video, that they didn't do that.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.760]   And I think what I'd heard floated
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.280]   was the concern about copyrights.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:52.960]   Really?
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.200]   There's a lot of stuff on Google video.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.400]   Also, if they actually touched it,
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.960]   well, they could have created a routine in which they make
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.760]   you do it, but you could just do it.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.840]   They're making you copy the stuff back to your own machine
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.520]   and copy it back up, right?
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.960]   I thought there is a--
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.560]   move this to YouTube link.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.680]   I thought I read that somewhere.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:10.680]   No.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.440]   I'm counting on this.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.000]   I haven't used Google video on it all time.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.480]   No.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   There's a download link.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.000]   Just download it.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.840]   There is no move to YouTube.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.040]   There's no process to move to YouTube.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.160]   If you want to put it on YouTube,
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.520]   you have to download it and re-upload it.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.840]   There's no sense to me.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.880]   Must be a server issue.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.720]   It's just data.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.240]   Yeah, it seems like that--
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.000]   no, it can't be a server issue.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.640]   It has to be some sort of--
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.920]   Some league guys smell lawyers.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:36.440]   You're right.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.560]   I smell lawyers.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.360]   The Google video did kind of feel redundant for quite some
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   time now, didn't point with YouTube.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.200]   But it was--
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.960]   you know, it was the kind of thing a geek like me likes.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.720]   It was not the most popular thing.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.080]   And YouTube was so overrun by little kids
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:00.160]   and Fred Figglehorn and 10 minutes, videos.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.840]   And so it seemed like the grown up version of YouTube,
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.680]   I guess.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.680]   Right.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:04.680]   Right.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.960]   But the interesting thing is that this is indicative,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.680]   I think, of Google's management is that they should
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.600]   have killed it two months after buying YouTube.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.680]   Yeah, then it wouldn't have been such a big deal.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.520]   Right.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.040]   I mean, no sense.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.920]   Well, we have a new and better video platform.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.440]   Goodbye.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.440]   Everybody say, OK.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.080]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.200]   But people, they seem to be committed to it.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   And they, you know, some number of computers in it
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.160]   that didn't make any sense.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.360]   Right.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:32.040]   There's-- what is that incredible BBC documentary?
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:38.120]   Is it the power of dreams on the rise of the PR industry
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.200]   that's a must-see?
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.680]   And the only place I could ever find it is on a Google video.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.920]   I don't know where we'll go now.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.320]   And I think it's because it's--
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.360]   in fact, one of the reasons it doesn't air anymore
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.640]   is because, like I was in the prize,
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.240]   there was a clearance issue.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:57.480]   So I'm looking to look this up, the power of dreams?
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.840]   It's the power of--
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.160]   chat, or maybe you can help me out.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.400]   It's the story of--
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:11.840]   he was Freud's nephew and the creator of the public relations
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.960]   industry.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.200]   This guy was an amazing guy.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.320]   I did an ignite speech on him once.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.960]   Oh, cool.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.680]   I can't remember his name, of course, because I'm old
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.960]   and I don't need enough carbohydrates.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.320]   But he, for instance, he's widely
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:30.200]   credited with getting women the right to smoke
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:37.680]   in a suffragette rally in, I think, the 1910s.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.640]   He hired a bunch of comely young lasses.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.920]   And they carried signs like, now we can smoke.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.160]   And they were smoking.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.320]   And it was like power to the people.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.320]   His Virginia Slims.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.480]   He invented this stuff.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.040]   He's the guy who created four out of five doctors.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.840]   He was hired by the Pork Council to promote the sale of bacon.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.360]   So he asked doctors, is a hearty breakfast a good idea,
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.320]   four out of five doctors said, yes, he somehow
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.080]   conflated that with eating more bacon.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.160]   And basically said, four out of five doctors say, eat bacon.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.000]   What?
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.600]   Amazing.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.920]   The persuaders?
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.800]   That's a classic, but that's a later generation.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.920]   Somebody's asking a chatroom.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.800]   Century of self.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.280]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.640]   The Century of self.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.440]   God bless the chatroom.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.800]   Who needs a brain?
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.400]   No, I don't.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:26.920]   I don't.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.960]   I've externalized them.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.160]   Actually, this was Ray Kurzweil suggested
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.680]   that I just use the chatroom.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.400]   There's a great scene in Evita, where the army just marches
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.760]   together with Peron.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.880]   The chatroom seems like that with you, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.960]   Presidente.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.800]   So this guy transferred his VHS tape.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.640]   You can see it says EP and LR.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.680]   There's Freud.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.000]   And sad to say, this very classic,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.480]   you've got to get it, download it, or whatever.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:04.960]   Century of self says, just video will be removed April 29, 2011.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.000]   So Matthew Freud, who's the big deal PR in the UK now,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   is he?
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   No.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.760]   This guy's name was Edgar Bernays, B-E-R-N-A-Y-S.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.520]   Oh, but it's OK.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.200]   And he's widely considered the founder of public relations
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.400]   and ultimately advertising.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.040]   Well, it's actually the Matthew Freud, who is it,
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.280]   the Senator Freud is one of the big deal PR guys in the UK now.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.080]   Well, yeah, Bernays.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.280]   And there's, by the way, that's the video of Edgar Bernays
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.320]   on the screen right now.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.160]   Bernays was Freud's nephew and thought Uncle Siggie had
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:36.960]   the right idea.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.040]   He, Uncle Siggie, said that people were motivated
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.800]   by unconscious desires.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.040]   And he said, you know, we could apply this to advertising.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:51.000]   So at the time, I mean, basically, when he started in 1910,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.680]   advertising was a Sears catalog.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.560]   Here's what it does.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.120]   Here's what you-- if you need it, buy it.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.840]   He's a guy who came up with the whole notion of, you know,
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.720]   you've got bad breath, you smell, and girls would like you more
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.840]   if you smoke or drink or use right guard.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.560]   And really, the whole advertising industry came about
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.920]   because of this insight that you don't get people to buy stuff
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.640]   because they can actually use it or because it has features
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.040]   they want.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.840]   You get people to buy stuff by tricking them into thinking
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.880]   they can't live without it.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.520]   You know, tramples that I am, I would like to think
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:30.000]   that the internet becomes an antidote to that.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.520]   I'm not so optimistic.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.480]   That was the point of my speech.
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:38.240]   Was that in an era where the consumer has access
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.600]   to a huge amount of independent information,
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.680]   they've become more information driven,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.000]   and it no longer works.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.720]   People are much more sophisticated and cynical
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.320]   and no longer works to trick them.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.600]   They know better.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.520]   So in fact, what I said is our advertising
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.520]   has changed as a result of it.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.360]   All the ads that we do, for instance, on the Twit Network
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.280]   are about features and benefits, and they all have trial offers.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   We don't do, hey, if you don't use hover.com, people will stare.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.920]   Do you require that or you just tell them
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.760]   that's the only smart thing to do?
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.720]   Nobody would advertise with Twit unless they got that, I think.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.400]   To be honest, because we're no good at tricking people.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:18.880]   And so yes--
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.040]   So what this means is coming soon, we hope,
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:26.680]   if we do our job right, free trials of burritos.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.840]   They contacted us after our episode talking
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.480]   about the Chelsea restaurant.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:37.920]   Mr. Chipotle tweets said us an email saying two things.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.640]   First of all, if you do do Twig at Blog World,
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.480]   please do it from the Chelsea burrito store
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   and we'll feed you.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.000]   Great.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.360]   And he also did raise the issue.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.760]   Maybe we should advertise.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:52.120]   Because somehow our sales seem to increase 38%
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.840]   every time your show is on.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.000]   Nice.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:55.960]   I made that last word.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.720]   Mission accomplished.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.440]   I get tweets all the time saying I heard you on Twig,
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.560]   so I went and tried it.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.640]   Boy, I'm good.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.920]   That's Edgar Bernays style advertising,
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.960]   where we just talk about how delicious something is
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.280]   and it makes you hungry and then you unconsciously
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.640]   your needs and desires.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:16.200]   And you have to have it supported now.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.800]   So it's actually not the kind of advertising.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.400]   But no, I really believe you're exactly right, Jeff,
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.960]   that you can no longer get away as effectively
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:30.120]   as you used to with the deceiving people kind of ad.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.080]   You've come a long way, baby.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.440]   Cigarettes represent freedom and power for women.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.800]   You have to give them features and benefits.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.040]   And I even go a step further with our advertisers.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:45.200]   I say you may only advertise if you come to our community.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.800]   Because that's where you're advertising to my--
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.120]   this is my-- these are my people.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.240]   This is my community.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:53.320]   And come to them as an equal saying, here's
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.800]   what we have to offer.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.280]   We trust your judgment.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.600]   Try it if you like it.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.320]   Use it if not fine.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.960]   And you have to be part of the community.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.920]   And I think that that's really what is happening.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.000]   And I think it's one of the reasons
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   that frankly, new media advertising does, in fact,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.680]   work better than having an ad on Seinfeld.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.080]   Drink.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.640]   It's not going to work for Coke because Coke
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.400]   has no features and benefits.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.080]   Well, the chat room, Web 4805 says,
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.280]   Freud studied burritos for many reasons.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:26.240]   Sometimes a burrito is just a burrito.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.960]   Ladies and gentlemen, I got the right point.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:28.960]   I got the right point.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.440]   I got the right point.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:29.960]   I got the right point.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.600]   Patroen is a feature.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.840]   Patroen is a feature.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.800]   Patroen in the margaritas is a feature.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.320]   That's a feature.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.280]   With potentially benefits.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.560]   No, I think you're right.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.760]   I think we do talk about the features
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.000]   and benefits of a fine meal at Chipotle.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.560]   Mm.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.800]   I'm not sure taste good.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.280]   Mm.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.160]   That's a feature benefit.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.360]   Hey, actually, let me do an ad if you don't mind.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.480]   And then we'll be back with more.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.600]   We are talking about Google the crowd--
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.960]   Free advertising for Chipotle.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:03.960]   I keep giving it away.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.160]   What is that?
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.760]   What's wrong with me?
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.120]   This is a show where, as you can see, we cover ideas.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.600]   And that's what I'm most proud about.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.840]   This is a smart show, and I hope you are enjoying it.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.680]   We trust our audience as a smart audience.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.800]   And I think that's one of the reasons
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.560]   we have to do ads differently.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.760]   When you have a smart audience, you can't say,
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.240]   you will smell bad if you don't use hover.com.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.720]   They just don't buy it.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:32.320]   What I do invite you to do is go to hover.com, twig.hovered.com,
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   and try it out.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:37.360]   It is domain name registration made clean, made simple,
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.320]   above-- whoops, made disappearing.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:45.240]   Above all, I'm trying to put the DO back in domain.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.240]   Hover puts the O back in domain name registration.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.800]   How do you like that?
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.840]   There's a slogan.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.720]   If you go to twig.hovered.com, you'll
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:54.560]   notice something right away.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.160]   They're not trying to upsell you.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.480]   There's no hover girls.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.280]   There's no dead elephants.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.400]   There's just a great clean site that does one thing
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.760]   and one thing simply sell you domain name registration
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.840]   at a fair price.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.360]   Twig.hovered.com.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.800]   In fact, if you go there and use the coupon code twig
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.040]   when you buy, you'll get 10% off.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.160]   I just bought Leo Laport.us.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.560]   I realized I didn't have that in Leo Laport.tv
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.920]   because I thought I should really have it.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.000]   It was so easy on hover.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.960]   It took me just a couple of clicks of the mouse.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.360]   If you do have problems, you won't.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.560]   But if you do, you can call their tech support number
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.400]   and they guarantee no hold during business hours.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.280]   They also have-- click this link, transfer your domain
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.200]   right here at twig.hovered.com.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.480]   They have a domain name transfer concierge service.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.800]   You can do it yourself, but I tell you,
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.120]   it is such a pain to transfer a name
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.840]   that I recommend this concierge service.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:52.160]   Now normally, it's $25 flat fee for one domain or 1,000.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.360]   They just do it all for you.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:59.000]   You call them at 866-731-6556.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.480]   We're going to waive that fee for you right now.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.920]   So if you go to twig.hovered.com,
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.800]   if you say you heard it on twig, they will not charge you.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.880]   And they will move all your domains for you.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.640]   Domain name transfers are $10.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.000]   But really, the transfers for you
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.920]   are getting another year for $10.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.480]   You're getting a renewal of your name for $10.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.920]   I think that's a great deal.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.440]   They do include who is privacy at no extra charge.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.520]   The other guys will try to sell you that.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.960]   They won't try to sell you hosting because they don't do that.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.720]   They will do email hosting, email addresses,
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.240]   and email forwarding.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.320]   But that's it.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.240]   It's a great deal.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.440]   Domain started $15.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.760]   I think I paid $25 for a .tv because they're more expensive.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.200]   But .us was $15.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.560]   They have .ca, too, if you're in Canada.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.720]   Twig.hovered.com.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:49.560]   Give it a try.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.800]   I think you'll like it.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.880]   See?
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.560]   Features and benefits.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.800]   Features and benefits.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.720]   No dead elephants.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.720]   No dead elephants.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.680]   That's a good feature.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:56:59.800]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.520]   Oh, I do.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.040]   I do.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.720]   There was one company.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.320]   It was another domain registrar that capitalized on this.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.200]   They said something like, well, we'll
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.840]   donate a dollar to PETA for everybody who signs up.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.400]   $20,000.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:10.880]   Brilliant.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.800]   $20,000.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.320]   Wow.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.160]   Was that the number?
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.200]   $20,000.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.880]   And that wasn't hover.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:21.800]   You got to think that's got to have hurt GoDaddy.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.040]   Oh, did I say that?
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:25.920]   There's no reason to be coy.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.000]   Everybody knows what I'm talking about.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:28.760]   Spain.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.360]   This is probably something for you, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:32.880]   Spain.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:38.320]   Actually, I want to-- yeah, go ahead.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.320]   I want to talk about the iPhone thing sort of related
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.040]   to this a little bit.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.040]   Well, yo, we got to talk about that, too.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.520]   Well, let's start with that.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:45.760]   I added another thing to the list.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.400]   It's a term related to that.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.400]   Everything's related.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.040]   So we talked about this on security now.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.720]   This just came out today that the iPhone, for reasons not
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.920]   completely clear, has logs everywhere you go.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.600]   And that file is stored on the iPhone
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.240]   and backed up to every time you connect your iPhone,
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.840]   backed up to your hard drive.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.400]   And it stores all your GPS data.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.480]   And then if you get your iPhone or iPad,
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.760]   it moves the file onto it.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.720]   It lives from device to device.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.560]   Wow.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.560]   Right?
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.520]   And there's a new software that will actually grab the file
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:21.280]   and plot out for you all your GPS coordinates.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.840]   And it's not clear what this file is for,
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.280]   why Apple's storing it.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.360]   So it just sort of came out today at the where.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.520]   Apple's storing it on your machine on your phone.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.120]   There's no evidence that there--
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:32.600]   Take it.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.080]   There's no evidence that they're getting it,
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.400]   but we don't know.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.600]   Right.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.760]   Yeah, you know, it's funny.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.800]   I was talking to a friend of mine who
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.360]   has been using an Android phone for a while.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.040]   And she said, you know, I don't download apps
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:46.640]   because I always get that warning that they need access
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.560]   to my contacts, they need access to my network
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.240]   or my location.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.360]   That kind of freaks me out.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.560]   I just want to get an iPhone because I
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.360]   don't want to have to worry about that stuff.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:57.040]   But the difference is that the iPhone doesn't tell you
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.240]   what it's doing as much as--
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.440]   you know, as Android tells you--
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.280]   and it's a little scary because it's
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.680]   like, why do you need access to my location data?
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.160]   But I would rather know than not know.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.480]   So I think this is what it is, the issue with this,
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.320]   is that they're just not transparent about it
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.200]   about what they're collecting.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.920]   There's another issue here, which is--
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.040]   this is the story I put up on the list.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:20.920]   The ACLU just said that Michigan police have a device
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.560]   where they stop you, they take your phone.
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.080]   Yes.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.600]   Well, they're not your charge of the crime.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.800]   And they download all kinds of data.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.880]   It's a device designed--
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.960]   it's called Cell Bite or something.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.040]   Plug into a cell phone.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:36.200]   And within 90 seconds, copy it.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.600]   Just copy everything that's on there.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.920]   Which is just a violation of privacy.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.640]   And, you know, hey, I'm Mr. Public and all that.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.320]   That is the most horrendous violation
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.960]   of government authority and privacy.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.400]   And now the added problem is with this Apple thing,
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.200]   they could very-- they easily get where you've been
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.480]   in the last, what, year?
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:53.680]   It's all there.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.280]   Everybody.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.680]   I got to tell you, thanks to Penn registers,
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.920]   they can get that data from the carrier.
[00:59:58.920 --> 00:59:59.640]   That's true.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.160]   That's true.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.760]   They're not a warrant.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.440]   There are plenty of ways you could--
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.400]   this is the thing that I keep trying to say to people,
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.200]   is that if you're carrying around a cell phone,
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.480]   this is a spying device.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.920]   And we have no idea what kind of data is being recorded.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.160]   We know now that there are at least three applications
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.080]   in the iPhone store that turn on the microphone.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.000]   Without notice to you, all three companies say, oh,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.520]   we don't send data back.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.640]   Well, OK, fine.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.880]   But they turn on the microphone.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.480]   Color, that $41 million thing.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.920]   This is what they told Robert Scoble,
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.040]   and is this, make sure you tell Leo this.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.560]   We turn on the microphone, but all we do
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.440]   is we listen to see if you're in a noisy room,
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.640]   because maybe there'll be other photographers there,
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.480]   and we store that information.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.200]   We don't send that information back.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.840]   Well, first of all, I don't understand
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.200]   the merit or value of doing such a thing.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.520]   But second of all, there is nowhere
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.120]   that it says they do that.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:00.920]   Right.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.880]   And there's nowhere where you give them permission to do that.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.680]   And just because they don't send it back
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   doesn't mean they couldn't send it back.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.240]   Or even that I should trust them that they are sending it back.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.320]   You know, Gina, I think the point you raised
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.120]   is really the huge point here, which is that our devices
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.480]   aren't our devices.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   No.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.720]   We don't have control over them.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.320]   We don't even have knowledge of what they do.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.600]   And that's a violation, a personal violation.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.200]   And it's amplified when it's a tiny personal computer
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.080]   that's in your pocket.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.880]   With a microphone and a camera.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:35.120]   With a microphone and a camera and an accelerometer.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.320]   Exactly. Exactly.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.160]   This is, if you were going to try to,
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.160]   if you were James Bond 20 years ago,
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.960]   and you were going to try to track Dr. No
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.640]   and find out what he was doing,
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.680]   that's what you would give him.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.480]   It's not cookies, they're going to do this.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.720]   No.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.520]   It's a phone.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.200]   And everybody who ever watched, you know,
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:58.000]   a born identity or any of these thrillers knows that
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.400]   first thing they do is throw away the phone.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.680]   He takes the, he always is, you know,
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.480]   there's some Anja knew, who he picks up.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.920]   And she's now going to have to tag along
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.720]   for the rest of the movie and close.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.160]   It'll be perpetually falling off.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.720]   And the first thing he does is he says,
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.560]   "Give me your phone."
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.960]   She says, "What?"
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.480]   And he takes it and he smashes it with a hammer.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.560]   I'm sorry, why did I bring that up?
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.400]   I don't know.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.720]   - Leave it with the head of the FTC.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.000]   Why don't I for Google just now?
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.320]   Because they didn't do not track into Chrome.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.640]   Well, there's no law that says you got to have do not track.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.040]   - Right.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.760]   - And he's enforcing a law that doesn't exist yet.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.640]   I'm not, you know, even though I think you and Steve
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.520]   were very rational about this Apple thing,
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.360]   I think you're right.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.120]   - Steve was more rational than I am.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:43.960]   - Okay.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.960]   - I allowed him, he's a security guru.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.360]   - But do you think he'd be the one to be going security?
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.720]   - No, he doesn't like to sound the alarm
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.880]   unless there's evidence.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.720]   - Right.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.520]   But I do think that this is where Gina's point
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.480]   is exactly right.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.120]   If we ever need a transparency,
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.360]   is in what our devices are doing to us, for us?
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.040]   - Mm-hmm, absolutely.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.040]   - Although I do agree that since Chrome is the last browser
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.000]   not to support do not track, I mean, there's a plugin for it.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.800]   But Firefox, Internet Explorer 9, Safari--
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.800]   - No people, that's true.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.240]   They're in the ad business, man.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.240]   (laughs)
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.800]   - You think that they're actively not gonna do it
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.640]   because of that?
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.360]   - I don't think so, but I think it's a way,
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.440]   'cause in PR they're gonna have to at some point.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.960]   But I, they are in the ad business.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.640]   We got that free 'cause they do ads, they do cookies.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.640]   They want signals to be able to give us better search.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.160]   It's gonna affect their business
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.760]   and they're being told, they're being pressured
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.560]   to put that in there when there is absolutely no law
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.400]   or authority to tell them to do that.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.640]   - Except the head of the FTC
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.680]   who can put a lot of pressure on them to do it.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.320]   - But that's not the way government should work, should it?
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:59.720]   Well, is it in our interest that they put that in the browser?
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.920]   I mean, in the people's interest?
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.200]   - I would argue that that's being put forward
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.000]   as an obvious, a self-evident truth
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.440]   that cookies and tracking are bad
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.000]   by the likes of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:12.840]   - Wow.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.560]   - But tracking are what support media.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.400]   - Right.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.960]   - They help give us news.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.720]   All the whining about the future of news,
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.880]   if we hurt the advertising business too much.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.880]   - That's true.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.440]   - You hurt the whole media industry.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:28.080]   And, you know, well, but I would say for instance,
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.120]   there's ad blockers in the world.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:30.960]   - Right.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.480]   - And if I acted totally in self-interest, I would say,
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.960]   oh, we should make ad blockers illegal
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.160]   because that will block my ability to make revenue.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.640]   - No, what I say, when I say this in the book,
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.800]   if you can do all these things, right?
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.200]   You can turn off cookies, you can erase cookies,
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.160]   you can block all kinds of things, and that's fine.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.000]   And, you know, you don't even need a block,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.720]   you know, a cookie killing, do not track things.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.440]   What you do is turn off your cookies.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.960]   But what you've done is you've made yourself less valuable
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.320]   to those who are providing this stuff to you.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.640]   The same as when we fast forward through ads.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.200]   And you just need to be aware of that.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.400]   And it's a decision you're making
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.200]   and the decision has an impact.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.160]   - I should point out that it was computer world's headline
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.320]   that said that Leibowitz called out Google Chrome.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.760]   As far as I can tell, the quote merely is Apple
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.600]   as an ask, they're gonna put it in their Safari browser
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.720]   that gives you Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.800]   Really the only hold out, the only company
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.280]   that hasn't evolved as much as we would like on this is Google.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.360]   I guess that's calling them out.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.600]   But- - Well, yeah, you're right
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.440]   to be more reasonable than that.
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.640]   - It's not the FTC saying, Google, you better do this
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.000]   or you're in trouble.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.960]   - You're just getting your diplomacy muscles
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.520]   going before parents.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.800]   - It's encouragement.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.320]   But I think this is appropriate encouragement.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.840]   I think the FTC should encourage companies
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.360]   to protect consumers.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.720]   - Well, but again, there are unintended consequences.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.080]   Go back to the story a bunch while ago.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.600]   There's no a suit by many parties in Spain
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.440]   to try to enforce a notion of a right to forget.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.720]   Now there's no right to forget to be forgotten,
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   right to be forgotten.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.680]   - I like this.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.000]   You don't like this.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.840]   - I hate this.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.560]   - Well, you can't do it for one thing.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.480]   - That's one, but it also is a terrible record.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.520]   So if you're a sleazy Paul, if you're a braille sconey,
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.280]   and you try to argue that you have a right
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.120]   to be forgotten, that you, that he has some right
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.560]   to take out of the public record,
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.720]   things that he's done.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.680]   - That's a good point.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.840]   - That impinges then on my free speech,
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.640]   if I wanna say that I saw him with a 12 year old.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.160]   - But, okay, so a public figure shouldn't have the right
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.240]   to forget, but should a personal private figure
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.080]   have the right to forget?
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.920]   What about a teenager who committed indiscretions
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.480]   that have made it to Facebook?
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.640]   Shouldn't she have the right--
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.000]   - Very likely, where's the line that says that's okay?
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.080]   What if that person runs for president someday?
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.200]   And we wanna be able to judge that.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.000]   And so what you do is you then get to a point
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   where you try to erase everything about you just in case.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:53.840]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.680]   - And everything about everything.
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:55.880]   And then what we've also done is you've been
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.000]   pinched on my free speech.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.480]   If I'm the one who says something about you,
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.360]   and you can come to me and say,
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.360]   no, you must forget that.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.120]   - Oh, that's a very good point.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.200]   That's a first amendment issue.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.040]   - Yeah, that's a very good point.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.800]   And in fact, that's what happens.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.680]   That's what I warn teenagers about.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.120]   I say, you may never blog about this,
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.600]   or post it on Facebook,
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.040]   but if there's 10 people around you with camera phones,
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.680]   you can't control it. - It's not up to you.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.160]   - It's not up to you. - Got it.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.880]   - So I-- - Which means we gotta adapt
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.480]   society to that.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.520]   It's just a reality now.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.520]   We all know. - Well, yeah, what do you tell?
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.440]   I mean, so what I said is consider that
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.640]   as you behave in public.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.120]   And I also said, and maybe this is what you would say, Jeff,
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.120]   that in time, I think we will evolve to the point
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.840]   where we'll all have skeletons in the closet.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.240]   We'll recognize that that every human does,
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.880]   and we'll maybe be a little more tolerant of such things.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.240]   - Gina, I hope this isn't an untoward question,
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.200]   but since you live around university folks
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.480]   and some people and your wife deals with these issues,
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.440]   how much faith do you have that young people today
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.560]   are smart about all this?
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.360]   - I think that young people today are actually
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.000]   pretty savvy about this,
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.160]   just based on my experience with my young nephews,
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:13.120]   who just instituted a no-adults role
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.920]   in their friends list on Facebook, which is kinda funny.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.760]   She changed their names, who list themselves as married
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.480]   to friends and siblings with friends,
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.680]   kind of play with their identities online.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.760]   And who have both had issues where parents and family
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.960]   saw things on Facebook that didn't make them happy
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.800]   and then they had to suffer the consequences?
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.440]   I think that happens to university students all the time.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:37.560]   Things come up on Facebook parties and residence halls,
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.000]   alcohol, that kind of thing.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.840]   I mean, cases are tried, judicial cases
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.160]   at the university are tried that way all the time.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.240]   So, you know, I mean, sometimes they're learning the hard way,
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.880]   but I think in general, when you grow up with the internet,
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   you become circumspect about this as you go.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.960]   And I do think that there's an understanding about this.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.640]   And I do think that there will be a little more leeway
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.280]   that a lot of everybody will have something wacky
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.200]   that happened online, you know, when they were a kid,
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.400]   you know, going forward in the future.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.200]   But I also think that young people are becoming
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.680]   a little more circumspect, especially when you're in university
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.000]   and you're wondering, you know, how am I going to get a job,
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.280]   you know, and how am I going to interview?
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.640]   I mean, listen, some students that led the UCLA student
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.800]   who had that YouTube rant about that horrible racist YouTube
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.920]   rant, I mean, she obviously didn't think about what that was
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.480]   going to do.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:27.240]   But, you know, she's out of school now.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.440]   And I think that students learn from those experiences.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.040]   I don't know how to say.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.440]   So in Spain, what they would say is not only,
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.920]   I mean, she has a right to, it's her own video.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.000]   So she can take her video down from YouTube.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.680]   But the fact that she did that, and it spread,
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.000]   and that's the internet, it spread, what the Spanish piece
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.440]   would say is that the claim is that Google should erase all
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.360]   links to any references to that.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.160]   I find that scary.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.440]   That's trying to erase.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.800]   Yeah, I find that's great.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.520]   You've turned me around on that.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.640]   You've turned me around on that, Jeff.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.920]   You're absolutely right.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.920]   Yeah, I mean, that video spread all over.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.680]   People uploaded it to their YouTube accounts
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.120]   because it was deleted and they wanted it.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.720]   Because everyone was talking about it.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.480]   And it had become an event.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.520]   It had become a really big thing.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.160]   Kids make mistakes.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.120]   I mean, absolutely.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:17.320]   And so, but the solution is not to expunge the record.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.920]   Although we do that with criminal records for people under 18.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.840]   Yes, but we don't do it to the newspaper record.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.360]   But newspapers don't normally--
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.960]   They generally don't use the name, but in some cases, they will.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.520]   Yeah, they're not legally obligated to protect minors.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.120]   They just choose to.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.680]   And you know, the other thing with that video,
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.600]   I think it's a really good example, Gina, is listen, it was stupid,
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.320]   but it wasn't.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.040]   So god-awful offensive.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:46.840]   It was just dumb.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.840]   It was really dumb.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.560]   Yeah, but not everybody's going to--
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.520]   I mean, that may not be the universal reaction,
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.880]   especially later in life.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.640]   Yeah, that's well, welcome to responsibility.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   [CLICK]
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:07.960]   Yeah, but if you're 12, can you be held to the same
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.120]   standard or--
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.560]   Well, if you're 12, you can say, listen, Zuckerberg sent those IMs
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.360]   about the dumb idiots who trust them.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.280]   And we cut him some slack because he was 19.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:18.840]   We did.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.080]   And he said I was 19.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:21.240]   Right.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:21.960]   I was stupid.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.320]   I mean, this happens, right?
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:23.880]   Right.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.080]   That's the issue for society.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.160]   If society can't forgive a kid for doing something dumb,
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.520]   then we've got a big problem.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.160]   It's not the kid.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.440]   Yeah, it's a bigger problem, right?
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.360]   Well, our society's not notoriously forgiving.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.160]   Oh.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.640]   Interesting.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.120]   All right.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.400]   That's a great debate.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.960]   And it's a tough one because--
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   and there's merit on both sides of it,
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.800]   but I have to say it's too draconian to have a right to forget.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.440]   Well, but you'll have this debate in Paris,
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.280]   Mr. President.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:52.440]   Good.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:52.840]   I know.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.040]   I'm taking notes.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.240]   Because the EU has presented four pillar--
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.920]   Vivian Redding, I'm sure we'll be there.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.200]   I've gotten into fights with.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.960]   Who should be doing this?
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:04.760]   That will not meet, Jeff.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.720]   I'm not sure.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.600]   I don't know.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.280]   But it has four pillars.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.680]   And I can't remember what the other three are.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.960]   I'll find out for the next week's show.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.320]   But one of them is the notion of a right to be forgotten.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:19.560]   And it's easy to say, and it's easy to be popular saying that.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.680]   But there are unintended consequences.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:28.360]   And the internet is too young and too new and too fresh and too unknown to do that.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.080]   I think you have to-- it's on surface, it sounds like a good idea.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.840]   But if you dig it all deeply into it,
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.960]   you realize the consequences of doing it are too great.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:43.480]   But you've got to figure that Monica Lewinsky and Rebecca Black both wish that
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.080]   people would just forget who the hell they are.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:52.040]   I think Rebecca Black is enjoying the fact that she just beat out Bieber on YouTube.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.680]   That just proves that the internet is happier to make fun of stuff than actually enjoy things.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.280]   Yeah, that's a very good point.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.640]   Although now we don't really know how many of Bieber's views are making fun of him.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.920]   Well, that's true.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.560]   Good point.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.320]   It could be.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.840]   That's the secret of his success too.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.920]   I don't know.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.000]   I'm going to argue that most of Bieber's views are young teenage girls who really
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.040]   just want to watch Justin.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.760]   I drove carpool the other day.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.920]   Did I tell you this story?
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:19.880]   No.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.760]   No, I'm scared.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.600]   My son for some reason wouldn't get in the car with me.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.640]   So instead 16-age girls, I guess they're probably all 15, 16-year-old girls got in,
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.600]   plugged in their iPod and listened to Justin Bieber the whole way home.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.640]   Really?
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.240]   And I thought, wait a minute, you're 16.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.000]   You aren't you at least a little bit arch and sardonic and cynical yet?
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.240]   You should be very happy about that, Leo.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.840]   Make you so happy.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.400]   My kids, my kids, arch, sardonic and cynical.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.360]   He's cute.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.120]   And my nephew's hate has guts.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:56.200]   Henry says, don't you get by now that nothing I say is serious?
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.000]   Okay.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:13:59.880]   Sorry.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.560]   I didn't realize nothing.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.040]   Nothing.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:05.400]   So maybe there was.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.960]   I'm raising an ironic child.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.920]   I guess it was just inevitable.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:16.120]   We have been sent to copyright school, by the way.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.080]   We have many strikes do we have against us, not just this video.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:23.800]   In fact, I just already violated quote, violated copyright law by showing Mark and
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.720]   the president talking on Facebook.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.640]   We get taken down.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.160]   Should be creative commons.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.080]   Yeah, that's got to be creative commons, isn't it?
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:31.960]   No, I don't know.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.040]   Look, I mean, it's the president.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.520]   So I mean, I have no trouble with it because it's news.
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.320]   Right.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.080]   And in fact, while there is no.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.400]   If there were ever warfare comment, you just fear.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.720]   I mean, but you know, that has to be, that's there's no, it's not written into law.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.720]   It has to be defended by a court.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.200]   Yes.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:53.720]   There's no copyright on here at all, as far as I can tell.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.800]   Well, it says Facebook copyright 2011.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.520]   So I think they do assert.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.240]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.480]   I mean, if it's a president, I think that's public domain.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.560]   But anyway, the point being that we frequently show clips from stuff.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:11.560]   And we almost always get either a takedown or dinged in some way.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.240]   Sometimes they don't take it down.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.160]   And it's always in my opinion, because this is a new show, a fair comment for use.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.760]   We defend it.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.040]   But because we have so many strikes against us, a, we're not on YouTube live.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:28.280]   And B, in order to get on YouTube live, we have to go to YouTube copyright school.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.960]   Are you serious?
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:30.520]   Really?
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:30.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.240]   There's, you know, I thought you were a king.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.120]   No, no, no, no.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.920]   There's a for users who continually violate copyright,
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.560]   YouTube copyright school.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:47.160]   Please take a moment to watch this video on copyright and answer the following four questions.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.760]   Let's see if you can answer the questions.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.480]   Oh my God, they quiz you afterwards.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.760]   Just without seeing the video.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.360]   Let's see how smart you guys are.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:54.760]   Oh boy.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.240]   Oh boy.
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:55.960]   Oh boy.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:01.880]   In order to determine whether specific copyrighted content is authorized to be used on YouTube,
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:06.520]   you should upload it to your account and wait for the content ID system to remove any unauthorized
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.080]   content.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.120]   True or false.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:08.920]   False.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.320]   False.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:09.800]   False.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.440]   False.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.280]   If content is available on the internet, it is in the public domain and therefore
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.880]   okay to upload to YouTube.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   You'd have to be an idiot not to get this right.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.040]   Of course, my son would lie all the way through and say,
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.000]   joking.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.600]   The following item.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.240]   Oh, this is a good.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.280]   Here's a tricky one.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.800]   Tricky.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.000]   The following item is protected by copyright.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.680]   Your name.
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.840]   Your original idea.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.160]   Your original YouTube video.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.680]   Or your cat.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:45.480]   I'm going to say your original YouTube videos, protected by copyright, right?
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.880]   Apparently your name and original idea are not.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:52.520]   If someone alleges that you have infringed their copyright, you will receive a notification
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:55.400]   in your account and your email, both A and B or via text message.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.680]   I think both A and B.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.880]   Let me see if I could pass.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.080]   That'd be nice.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:16:59.400]   Then we could.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:03.640]   Uh, evaluation of your answers.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.040]   Correct.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:04.520]   Correct.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.160]   Correct.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:05.800]   Correct.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:06.840]   Congratulations.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:10.600]   You have successfully completed copyright school.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:11.800]   You passed.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:12.840]   You graduated.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:13.640]   Yay.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.600]   See, there's a pirate.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:15.560]   Oh, look at the pirate.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.720]   A bad cat pirate with a hook.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.360]   He's stealing videos.
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:24.680]   I think, uh, I have to say, I think YouTube has been over way too far
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.360]   in the realm of, uh, rights holders.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:33.240]   That's also what Larry Lesson said, because we, we, he, this is his whole issue.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.080]   So we put examples in his videos.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.560]   And he puts the videos on YouTube and he has to appeal every time.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.040]   Every time.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.080]   Every time.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.120]   And there.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.920]   So we need a whole department just to deal with the, uh.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:48.200]   And it is not a de minimis loss to us because, uh, it's a significant number of impressions that we
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:48.760]   lose.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:54.840]   And because it's a news show, even a 24 hour takedown basically means that that video is no
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:55.320]   case.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.080]   So let's use the power of twig.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:03.640]   Let's get someone on and let's lobby Google on this and, and hear their side of why this is
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:09.640]   difficult for them or why they, you know, that they're defaulting to this and try to give them some cover.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.400]   Okay.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.280]   I'm listening.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.400]   I'm off for that.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:13.800]   I'm off for that.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:20.360]   Meanwhile, if I were you, YouTube, I'd take down this video of the guy with the glasses and the
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:24.040]   liver in his hand, his bloody hand saying smell your own breath.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.720]   That's the video I'd take down.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.000]   Not this week in Google.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.600]   Stupid.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.080]   All right.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.120]   Let's take a break now.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.520]   While I recompose myself.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:39.320]   Cleansing breath going all up and down your chakra.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.440]   Baby.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:45.240]   Somebody sent me a book chakra exercises.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.840]   I can't wait.
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.120]   Thank you.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:51.240]   But you know what I do when I need to relax?
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:55.480]   I go home and I watch Netflix and I encourage you all to do exactly the same thing.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.200]   Netflix.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.400]   I love Netflix.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.160]   I just checked a minute ago.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.360]   I've been a Netflix customer since 2000, November, December 2000.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:08.840]   That's how long I've been using Netflix's amazing DVD by mail system.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:12.280]   And of course, a couple of years ago, they started doing this watch instantly thing.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.680]   And now I'm in love.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:19.400]   You know, the truth is I have a five disc at a time subscription, which is the max, I think.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.200]   I guess you get multiple five disc at a time subscriptions.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.160]   But I vary.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.240]   My discs are collecting dust because I'm almost always watching instantly.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.920]   YouTube has tens of thousands of movies.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:34.920]   You can watch right away just by searching for him on your TV set.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:40.600]   Many new internet connected TV sets have the capability of doing this.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.120]   Almost all the new Blu-ray players do.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:48.840]   And of course, your Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, your Wii and my favorite, the Roku box all can do this.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.520]   Look at these are, there's just so many great movies here.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.120]   And Netflix has a good, really good job of making recommendations.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:02.600]   So that as you as you go through, oh, they got Toy Story 3 on watch instantly in high def.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.560]   You know, it's on watch instantly right now, Leo.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:05.960]   What?
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:08.040]   Glee season one.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.840]   Oh, I know.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.400]   Because they've got TV shows, mad men's going on there.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.840]   They just bought rights to mad men.
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:19.000]   Yeah, I actually am going back to what the original Glee pilot.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.680]   The pilot is the best.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:21.400]   Isn't it funny?
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.720]   That don't stop believing.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:24.760]   Oh, that original.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.320]   I watched it again this week and I cried.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:27.960]   I'll admit it.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.760]   It's really good.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:32.840]   And of course, it's a little dated now because they put their stuff on MySpace.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:36.120]   Yes, they're still a little dang funny.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:40.760]   It's funny, but they're like early John Stamos references that like you don't get
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.360]   until you realize that he's on later on.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.960]   It's worth rewatching.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.520]   It's so great.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.720]   Let's make that our recommendation for the show today.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.600]   Glee is available the first season.
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.560]   Oh, and Monk and dropped at diva.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.400]   Oh my gosh, there's some great stuff on here.
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:59.880]   All you have to do is either add it to your instant queue for later reference or play it.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.960]   Now I got to warn you about the queue thing.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.640]   So I have a queue of DVDs.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:06.440]   You get the DVDs as little as one business day.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.120]   And I have a queue of watch instantly.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:12.760]   And my DVD queue is 234 DVDs.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.760]   Watch instantly 358.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.960]   So you don't really need a queue to watch instantly.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.040]   Frankly, you just watch it instantly.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.160]   Try it free for 30 days.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.200]   You're going to love it.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:25.000]   Netflix dot, look at all these movies I put it.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.200]   I don't know why I put them in the queue.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:29.160]   I guess so I don't forget that I want to watch them later, I guess.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.720]   Netflix dot com slash twit.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.960]   What's nice about watch instantly is none of these things gather dust.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.960]   They just sit there waiting for you to watch them later.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   Netflix dot com slash twit.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:42.920]   Try it free for 30 days.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:43.880]   Who doesn't love Netflix?
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:48.600]   My only concern with this entire ad campaign is who doesn't already have Netflix.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.040]   Right.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.400]   I mean, we're preaching to the choir here.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.520]   Oh, actually, yeah, we got it.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:54.760]   What?
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.680]   It's converted me.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:00.040]   I never did it because I didn't want to do the whole DVD thing.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.720]   And this this this convinced me.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.240]   It's already paid off.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.760]   You're kidding.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:05.960]   No, I'm weird.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.560]   Well, congratulations.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.320]   I didn't have an iPad.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.600]   I didn't watch Netflix.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.280]   This show is making a wreck of you.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.600]   And your personal life.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.720]   But that's what we're here for.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.080]   Time now for.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:21.000]   And thank you, by the way, Jeff, if I could just.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.520]   I don't know, maybe have a little earpiece with you on the other end and you could listen in and then just tell me what to say.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.640]   I don't know.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:28.360]   Leo, you're the man.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.320]   You represent the people.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:29.640]   You know.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.800]   Yeah, Leo, you're going to be great.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.000]   Great.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.520]   If I could bring the chat room with me.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:35.960]   Yeah, no, seriously.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.160]   Where's my RC channel?
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.400]   My chat room says you're full of it, Nick.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.280]   Okay.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.760]   I need an army of Googling.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.640]   Resource assistance as I talk.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.720]   Why can't I bring the chat room with me?
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:48.360]   Seriously.
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.720]   I think I can.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.640]   You probably are the back channel.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.240]   I think I will.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.320]   Deal.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.560]   Oh, everybody in the chat room is so excited right now.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.040]   They're like, we're going to the EGA.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.640]   You're going virtually chat room virtually.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:08.440]   Meanwhile, President Obama's sleeves are still rolled up, but his tie is not loosened.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.640]   This update brought to you by Facebook.com/FacebookLive.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.000]   It is time for our tool number and tip of the week.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.080]   Let us start with Gina Tripani and her tool of the week.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.040]   Tip of the week.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.560]   My tip is really simple.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.120]   It's kind of a tool.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.440]   Yeah, well, so they're two little two things.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.800]   One's really tiny and one's bigger.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:32.840]   The really tiny one made me so happy because I just, I love fav icons that tell you something
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.880]   about what's going on in the tab.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.880]   Google Calendar now puts the date in the fav icon.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.680]   What?
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.960]   So if you go to Google Calendar, I live for my Google Calendar.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:42.760]   Go to Google Calendar.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.880]   The fav icon we'll see.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.680]   Like today, it'll be 20 because today's April 20th.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:47.640]   And it works so well.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:53.080]   Like if you pin tab that in addition to gmails on red count and the fav icon kind of gives you,
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.320]   you know, lets you kind of glance up at your tabs and see what's going on.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.080]   So I was just a little, little date helper.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.200]   Oh, that is so cool.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.120]   Now, because it's an HTTPS, I have a padlock in my Chrome.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:07.960]   But if I go to the tab, I could see that in fact, it is the 20th.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.760]   The 20th.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.400]   And then I will say, oh my God, it's my 20th anniversary today.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.720]   I better not forget to buy some flowers.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:14.600]   There you go.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.320]   There you go.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.520]   That is cool.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.000]   That's cool.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.160]   It's just a little tiny thing that makes me happy.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.680]   The other big thing that launched is US, and I hope, oh, oh, oh,
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.120]   I hope Leo, this isn't your tool.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.440]   Map Maker, Google Maps, Map Maker launched for the United States.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.160]   So it's basically like Google Maps, editable Google Maps.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:36.360]   You go in, you put down where your favorite coffee shop is or you know, bike route.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:40.360]   And there's this apparently team of Google Maps editors who can
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.680]   review and approve changes to the map.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.960]   So it's basically correcting and augmenting maps.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.000]   This is so huge.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.640]   You know, OpenStreetMaps has been doing this all along, but they didn't have any data to begin with.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.360]   So this is a really, and by the way, as a result, OpenStreetMaps has some great maps,
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.800]   especially for bikers and hikers.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:02.360]   I expect this will make the same kind of difference to Google Maps.
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:03.240]   Yeah, if you can.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:08.360]   And as true as that, you can, you can companies and governments and such can put up piles of batch
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.240]   data to this too.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:09.960]   Oh, really?
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.880]   Yeah, I think I saw something in that way.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.400]   So, so I don't know what that means.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.800]   Maybe the park service could give you more data on the park or something that they now have.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.480]   No, that is cool.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.760]   Certainly I immediately filled out our Google Places thing, but that's separate.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.200]   That's a separate thing.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.200]   Let me zoom in to San Francisco.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:30.280]   So will it show if I zoom in on Google Map Maker, will it show things people have done?
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:34.120]   Yeah, there's a community edits tab on the top left there.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:37.000]   You see my edits, community edits.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:37.880]   Oh, look at that.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.600]   So here they are.
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.240]   So yeah, a lot of this is in fact business information.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.520]   Yep.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:44.760]   Tiburon International Film Festival.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.080]   Oh, actually some of these are places closed.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.360]   A lot of these are places closed.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.960]   Interesting.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.200]   So people are cleaning up the Google Maps.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.360]   That's fantastic.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.120]   That's better than plus one.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.760]   I, this is this is crowdsourcing.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.320]   I agree.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:25:59.800]   You bet.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.760]   You bet.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.000]   This is totally awesome.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.680]   So Google Map Maker at google.com/mapmaker.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.840]   You know what OpenStreetMaps does and I'd love to see this kind of functionality is if you've
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.800]   got a GPS, you can upload your track to the OpenStreetMaps and they'll use that just to know
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.320]   where there's streets and stuff where there's, and you can then annotate it.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.720]   There's a lot of additional features I'd love to see in here.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.480]   This is great though.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.240]   I mean, this at least you can fix these maps.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.440]   Actually, I was a tool I was considering, but I decided instead to do a tool that I hope
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.040]   you didn't do last week because it did come out last week and I dibs did then, which is
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.800]   a Google a day.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.720]   It's a trivia contest on Google.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:38.840]   No.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.880]   So if you go to a google a day.com, every day a new Google trivia contest.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.680]   Oh, yeah, if I skipped your number, but I'll get it next.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:47.400]   That's okay.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.600]   How do these homes relate to molecular soccer balls?
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.440]   And so it's kind of a, it's a, it's a Google in effect.
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.400]   That's the answer.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:55.880]   I'm going to say.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.920]   I hope it was about Google.
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:57.880]   I think it's geodesic.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.720]   I think it's a, it's a bucky ball.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.120]   Isn't it?
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.880]   Or whatever that let's see.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:07.080]   They're geodesic domes Buckminster Fuller held the first patent for geodesic domes.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:07.960]   So there you go.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:08.600]   The bucky ball.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:12.680]   So, so you can every, every day learn something cool and new and different.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.520]   Google a day.com.
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.920]   And now your number.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.040]   That answers Nick cards.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.160]   Google make us stupid.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:19.400]   No.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.880]   See, see Nick.
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:22.600]   See.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.960]   And in the tab it says what day it is.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.600]   So there.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.520]   We're smart.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.320]   Go ahead Jeff.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:37.480]   This is not a left field, but, but Henry Blodgett, who was an analyst in the bubble and
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:45.560]   got in some trouble right there wrongly for touting stocks in the one hand and emails that
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.120]   he sent privately to others disagreed with that.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:52.200]   He settled with Elliot Spitzer and the SEC overall that.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.880]   And Henry's been open about his past.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.520]   He's, Henry started Business Insider, which is kind of the.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.560]   It's actually a great blog.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.280]   I read it all the time.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.400]   Great site.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.760]   It's a tech crunch of business.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.760]   And it's really good and really well done.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.040]   And he faces his past and talks about it.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:06.520]   And that's that.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.280]   But he never really got a big interview.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:13.240]   So he put up, he allowed one of his people to do, you know, who was a tough writer to
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.040]   interview Henry.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:18.200]   No holds barred except for a few legal matters on his site.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:24.120]   And what I, what fascinated me just for a number today is that Henry,
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.680]   people ridiculed Henry because he said that the Amazon was going to hit $400 a share
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:29.320]   back in the day.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:32.120]   And this was part of the old bubble blowing up problem.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:37.080]   Henry points out that the split adjusted price for Amazon today, $1,100.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.840]   Wow.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.760]   He was right on Amazon.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.600]   You couldn't buy another stock if you ask me.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.520]   I mean, just a quality company.
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.960]   They deserve their success.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.000]   Well, I can't wait to watch this.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.360]   So says, James Altutcher.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.520]   Do you know who that is?
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.000]   That's doing the.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:53.560]   No.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.120]   No, I don't.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.280]   So yeah, this looks good.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.880]   It's fascinating because it takes you back to the bubble.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.560]   It takes you, you know, some insight into the spitzer and it's been such the whole thing.
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:04.600]   I think there's a movie here.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:10.840]   Isn't it funny that since Blodgett's downfall, Spitzer had his own downfall.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:13.400]   Oh, and now he's a CNN commentator.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.880]   So and Blodgett's been on his show.
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.080]   And here's the irony of this.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.760]   I said earlier, America doesn't forgive America loves to forgive.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:25.400]   If you get a check in right past, all you have to do is say, I'm sorry.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:29.720]   And even Rod Blagojevic can have a TV show.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.240]   Whatever happened to him.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.160]   Sorry, another show.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.680]   That's a good question.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.080]   Because I.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:35.560]   I haven't heard that.
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.200]   Maybe a while.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:36.920]   I just.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:37.880]   I've learned how to pronounce it.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:39.160]   Then I stop hearing it.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.440]   Spent so much energy doing that.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.920]   Jeff Jarvis is the author of this fine book.
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.440]   What?
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.400]   What Google do you see?
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.240]   I keep it on my bookshelf because I need to know.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:47.800]   You are wonderful.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.000]   You are wonderful, my sire.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.280]   And there is a new one coming.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.000]   I can't wait.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.720]   Public parts.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.560]   And will you send me the manuscript?
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.120]   So I mean, I.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.080]   Well, I actually will.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.840]   My publisher will be having an awesome to you.
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.520]   We have a new subtitle.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.800]   The other stuff I can throw now.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:07.000]   So it's now how sharing in the digital age is revolutionizing life, business, and society.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.440]   Well, that's close to the one we liked.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:08.840]   Okay.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.680]   It's been straighter, but you know, yeah.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:17.400]   But it's well, as I've learned, you kind of have to sometimes you have to say what the book's about.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.680]   Otherwise people think it's about penises.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.800]   Not that that wouldn't help sales.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.760]   Evidently the PR person for the publisher has said,
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:33.320]   we don't want to do too much on Jeff's penis.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:36.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.120]   I know the trees will say it is worth it.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:41.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:41.720]   Can't wait to see that.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.760]   Next day on the eat is pay.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.600]   I think we have a show title, by the way.
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:47.240]   And now,
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.240]   And Gina, thank you so much for being here.
