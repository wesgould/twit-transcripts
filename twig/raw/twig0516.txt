[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.680]   how Google's privacy policy has changed
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.200]   over the last 20 years.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.640]   Will Debunk a rumor that Google's about to create
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.360]   a fourth telecom company?
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.720]   And we'll talk about the 25th anniversary
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.280]   of a little e-commerce startup you might know.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.520]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.360]   to show we cover Google Linux.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760]   (laughs)
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.560]   A little Google and some more Linux.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.000]   No, I don't know where the Linux comes from,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.660]   but we actually do have some Linux stress
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.440]   and I'm just speaking Google mixed in.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.560]   Like a little cream in your coffee.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.920]   We also have some Facebook and Twitter
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.560]   and we have a very sleepy Jeff Jarvis
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.240]   who is in Madrid right now.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.240]   (laughs)
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.080]   Is that a couple of services?
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.520]   He's had some Hamoni Barrico.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.720]   He's had some queso and Nido.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.560]   - Queso and Nido.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.320]   I worked to a Mexican restaurant in Madrid,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.280]   which is kind of insane,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.840]   but you have queso and Nido.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.800]   - So jealous.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.480]   - And was it good?
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.880]   - Taco al pastor, con queso.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   - Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.520]   That's Mexican food.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.360]   - I know.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.200]   That's what I did tonight.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.040]   'Cause here's why.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.880]   - Why?
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.720]   - 'Cause you.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.560]   - Me?
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.720]   - 'Cause every restaurant opens at nine o'clock
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.560]   and I'm here at 10 o'clock.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.400]   - Oh, I know.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.960]   - So I went over to the Goya stop on the Metro
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.320]   and just tried to find a restaurant nearby
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.800]   that was open at eight o'clock.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.640]   - Oh, God.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.480]   - I know, isn't that weird?
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.640]   - I heard about for an hour to get to eight o'clock
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.480]   so I could have dinner.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.640]   - Barcelona's like that too.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.600]   It's like you're going to the Denny's early bird dinner
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.640]   if you try to eat at seven.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.400]   It's like, no, what?
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.040]   - All kinds of restaurants do not open until nine.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.840]   - Well, I apologize but I'm glad you got something delicious
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.120]   it sounds like and.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.960]   - It was good.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   It was so cute. - Thank you so much.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.760]   - What brings you to Madrid?
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.840]   - Lizzi also y de maciado.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.680]   - What's that?
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.520]   - The IAMCR, I don't even know that stands
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.720]   for Academic Conference,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.800]   I'm giving a presentation tomorrow.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.440]   Post Gutenberg, Post Mass, you've heard it before.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.480]   - It's the International Association for Media
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.440]   and Communication Research, IAMCR.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.280]   So I did that, I've enjoyed that tomorrow.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.320]   I've met with El Pais today
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.720]   and Sarah, a police radio yesterday
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.520]   and university students tomorrow.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.280]   - We forget, we forget.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.840]   'Cause Jeff's here all the time, he's such a regular guy
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.720]   so, you know, he's always smart and everything.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.840]   We forget that he's actually pretty damn famous
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.240]   in the general world about town.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.560]   I mean, he's like in demand speaker.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.320]   So that's awesome and congratulations and what an honor.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.520]   - It would be, if we're not for this,
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.680]   I would be at VidCon this week,
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   which we rescheduled in July.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.520]   - Oh.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.040]   - The first time in five years, could it be there?
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.880]   - I wanted to go to VidCon with Michael
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.280]   'cause he's 16 and of course he's,
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.280]   what doesn't think-- - All perp mass.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.560]   - As anybody under 20 doesn't watch TV, they watch YouTube.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.040]   - Yeah, perp. - It's their TV.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.800]   Yeah, VidCon is an amazing event.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   Also with us, Kevin Tofel, co-hosted us in the--
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.000]   - Yay, Dr. Chromebook.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.600]   (laughing)
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.840]   - Dr. K-- - I am not,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.320]   I am not as famous as Jeff,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.120]   I'm just here as a backup utility player, I think.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.680]   - Yeah, he's the shortstop who came in
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.600]   when Wally Pip went out.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.960]   - There you go, Wally Pip.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.720]   I'm repping my community college,
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.760]   Manko Community College.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.680]   - Nice.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.600]   - Hat today.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.440]   - Are you done with that class?
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.280]   - Oh, I'm taking a summer class, abstract data types,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.880]   data structures, so yeah.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.600]   - Wow, and you do that in Python?
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.440]   - Very cool.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.680]   - No, that's in Java.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.840]   - Java, oh yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.680]   - Yeah, Java.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.320]   - So, how many students in the class
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.400]   and what's the range of ability?
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.480]   - They're all better than me, let's say.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.320]   (laughing)
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.400]   - No, you're humble.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.720]   - It's kind of tricky, Jeff,
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.000]   because this particular class
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.320]   being a 10 week summer class is an online class,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.320]   however, we do get together, oh gosh, three, four,
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.480]   sometimes five times a week at the campus library
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.760]   as a group to make it a little more social,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   to share ideas, basically to cheat, no, no, no, no.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.080]   - To study.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.120]   - No, I mean, it's a study group.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.440]   - It's a study group, exactly.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.760]   - There is no change.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.560]   - No, no, no.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.240]   So it's a good mix of folks.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.280]   A lot of smart guys and girls
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.800]   and hopefully I'm trying to work on some internship opportunities
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.480]   with some companies I may have worked for in the past.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.320]   - Oh, cool.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.720]   - Wait a minute, you wanna be an intern?
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.320]   - No, no, no, I'm not posting.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.320]   I couldn't be an intern.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.680]   - Kevin is the Chevy Chase of Monaco.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.000]   - Ah, I get it.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.560]   - Thank you, I was wondering something.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.120]   - Carsten got it.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.280]   - You're talking about community.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.760]   - He must have been a former TV guy critic.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.600]   - Yeah.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.920]   - Ooh, ooh.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.000]   - Well, it's so good to have Kevin.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.680]   He is, of course, the major demo about Chromebooks.com.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.440]   And Stacey's co-host, Stacey is in the midst of a move
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.720]   and so she's gonna be a little late
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.440]   but she will join us in about 15 minutes.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.280]   And Jeff, if you really get sleepy,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.160]   let Stacey take your place.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.000]   - I'll let you know.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.240]   - Yeah, and you can take a break.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.960]   But it's great to have both of you,
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.600]   both of our, we have such good smart people.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.520]   - Books and attics.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.720]   - Yeah.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.560]   Did you like, did you enjoy,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.120]   I thought it was a kind of well done
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.080]   the New York Times piece.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.560]   Now I know you're not a fan of the privacy project, Jeff,
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.200]   but Charlie Wartzel and Ash Ngooh,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.760]   I'm not sure how you pronounce that.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.120]   Did a really nice piece on Google's privacy policy,
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.560]   which when Google first started with 600 words
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.480]   is now 4,000 words 20 years later.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.320]   And they did--
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.480]   - It's really more about the change in society
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   than it is the change in Google.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.840]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.720]   It's Google reflecting how the internet,
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.560]   you know, and the requirements of the internet
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.480]   changed over time.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.000]   For instance, in 1999,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.480]   where they talk about sharing information,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.880]   they say, we only talk about our users in aggregate,
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.920]   not as individuals.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.480]   Three months later, that line was gone,
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.120]   reduced to its simplest form,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.120]   that is a statement that Google did not do exactly
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.600]   what Google does now as its primary business model.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.720]   They clearly care about individuals.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.560]   So that's something--
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.400]   - That's what they should.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.720]   - Yeah, right.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   But that's something that's changing.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.960]   And I think that line in aggregate
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.520]   is still used commonly by a lot of companies,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.480]   saying, well, we're not, you know, Facebook even says,
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.800]   we're not interested to use an individual,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.360]   we're interested in you as part of a larger demographic.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.280]   But that's not necessarily the case these days.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.520]   - It isn't, it isn't.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   I mean, the machine learning models
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   that they want this data for,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   they're obviously aggregating data.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.360]   - Yeah, those are in bulk.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.760]   - Yeah, but there are other cases where the services
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.320]   are very highly targeted towards individuals.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.880]   So it's kind of a mix between the two
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.240]   with these days, I think.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.400]   - Here is probably a better illustration
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.520]   of what we're talking about.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.200]   From 1999, what Google collects four things,
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.920]   aggregates search activity, personal information you provide,
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.320]   click through information and cookies.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.840]   And this is the list from 2019.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.000]   Your name, password phone number, payment information.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.760]   Now this is maybe just being more accurate,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.280]   'cause of course they had to do all that before.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.440]   Telephone number, phone number,
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.040]   calling party number, receiving party number,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.880]   forwarding number.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.240]   - They didn't have a telephone service back then.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.080]   - No, maybe not.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.000]   Yeah, audio purchase activity.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.160]   They didn't have purchases.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   - They're all there back then.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.600]   - Yeah. - That's all coming from Android.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.560]   - They did props, you perhaps get your IP address,
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.160]   but now they're saying it explicitly.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.960]   Data from publicly accessible sources,
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   that's a big change.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.400]   That means they're data sharing with trusted partners,
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.640]   marketing partners, security partners and advertisers.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.960]   That's a two way street,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   data from publicly accessible sources.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.480]   Not to, but from location data, of course,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.000]   that's become perfected since mobile began.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.880]   1999 wasn't mobile.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.920]   That was on your desktop.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.480]   So who cares what your location was?
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.240]   You didn't go anywhere.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.760]   So that's a big change.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.200]   - I don't see anything about the content in your home
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   from like the smart speakers and such, Nest products.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.040]   - I love, here's a good one.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.360]   This is 2011 to 2012, one year difference.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.240]   The strike through is the stuff that's gone.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.120]   Which is pretty much all of it.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.960]   And then they're on the blue on the right,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.200]   is they pretty much replaced it.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.440]   You know, this is what the new language was
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.680]   for information we share.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.600]   We share personal information.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.880]   Okay, not aggregated.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.320]   Personal information with companies,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.120]   organizations or individuals outside of Google,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.000]   when we have your consent to do so,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.400]   we require opt in consent, bravo Google,
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.080]   for the sharing of any, oh wait a minute,
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.160]   that's just for sensitive personal information.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.600]   And you have to figure out what they mean by that.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.200]   So this is, you know, it's a longer article
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.000]   than we have time to discuss.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.560]   There's the before GDPR and after GDPR,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.400]   which is a lot longer, a lot longer.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.960]   That's actually probably a good thing.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.680]   On the other hand, when something gets this long,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.120]   does anybody read it?
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.640]   Sure, there's more, you know,
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.960]   they're more transparent about what they're collecting
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.320]   because GDPR made them be,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.280]   but it also makes it completely impossible to read.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.440]   Hey, we had time for Mary Meeker's slide deck.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.320]   (laughing)
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.800]   Yeah, this is short of the Meeker's slide deck.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.280]   My comparison too, I think I mentioned this
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.040]   in a show a couple weeks ago.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.560]   When Facebook first had moderators,
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.120]   they had a one-page guideline,
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.320]   which basically, if you didn't like it,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.200]   get rid of it, and now it's a 40-page guideline.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.840]   Yep.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.320]   Times have changed and no better way,
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.520]   I think, to look at Google's privacy policy
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.080]   and policy now it's changed over the last,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.160]   that's 20 years, it's kind of amazing.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.160]   Great piece, I thought, thank you, Charlie.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.440]   Google is, this is from the post,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.960]   so you're gonna have to take it with a grain of salt or not.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.760]   Google is joining the New York Post, not the Washington Post.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.120]   Oh, yeah, that's a salt lake.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.280]   Yeah, salt lake, it's a Murdoch corporate organization.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.120]   Google joins Dish, I think this is accurate,
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.720]   and talks to create fourth mobile carrier.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.320]   Quickly denied.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.760]   Oh, really?
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.480]   Yeah, the next item in the run.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.800]   Okay.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.480]   Alan Malali, who we know well when he was the chairman
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.320]   of the Ford Motor Company, is now an alphabet director.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.360]   According to the post,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.000]   has recently been discussions with Dish
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.560]   about a plan to create a fourth player.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.000]   I'm glad that Alan's still in business,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.280]   I really thought he was a great CEO at Ford,
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.240]   and so do many others.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.760]   But the other thing that I liked about Alan,
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.760]   he was very forthright.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.520]   He really, he enjoyed talking to the press,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.680]   and I don't think it was a covert or a secretive guy at all.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.560]   Any advertised on a Twit?
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.640]   And he happened to be an Adri-Jazer, so Google denies it.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.120]   But let me read the denial.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.440]   Is it a denial or a non-denial denial?
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:27.280]   These claims are simply false, that's a denial.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.280]   It's a denial denial.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.160]   Google is not having any conversations with Dish
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.600]   about creating a wireless network.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.160]   However, he did decline to comment on whether Malali
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.920]   was speaking to Dish.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   Hmm, maybe alphabet's doing it, not Google.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.520]   Right, or with Google Fi,
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.720]   maybe they would just not create a wireless network,
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.360]   but add one to Google Fi.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.800]   Yeah, it would explain, though, the post's mistake because--
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.760]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.440]   Right.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.480]   I mean, there is Fi, is it a fourth network?
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.360]   It's an MVNO running on T-Mobile Sprint and US seller.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.400]   I don't say Google, keeping with phone companies.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.560]   Haven't we always said, though, that Google,
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.120]   yeah, get them in trouble?
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.040]   We've always thought that we always wish Google would.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.120]   Yes.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.040]   I don't think it's a business they really want to be in,
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.720]   personally.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.240]   No.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.600]   If they got out of the fiber business,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.200]   the internet business, why would they get in the far worse
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.120]   more--
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.440]   Are they out or just stopped on fiber, by the way?
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.360]   I think they just--
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.760]   What happened to the service?
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.480]   Oh, they're--
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.680]   They've been slowly shutting it down, I think.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.040]   Yeah, well, one city.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.440]   They are still-- you can still get it in a couple of cities,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:52.360]   but other than that, they are not going to roll out new ones.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.960]   So yeah, but that's not--
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.400]   I mean, if you go to the Google Fiber website,
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.160]   that's not the impression you get.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.000]   Your faster, fairer, kinder internet.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.920]   I'll take it.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.640]   If you look at the cities at Atlanta,
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.960]   I mean, they're still showing--
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.400]   Austin, they're still showing.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.520]   There are some asterisks.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.240]   I don't know what the asterisks lead to.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.920]   Soon to be shut down.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   Right.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.080]   Upgrade your internet experience.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.480]   Oh, this is because they do the deal with web pass,
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.320]   which is a provide on San Francisco.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.840]   Right.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.040]   So it's not Google's infrastructure.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.560]   It's web passes infrastructure.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.960]   And it's only in apartment buildings, by the way.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.400]   But it's nice if you get it.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.760]   Remember, Omelek was in love with web pass.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.480]   He had a web pass in his apartment.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.200]   He loved it.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.400]   So yeah, I mean, I think Google--
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.720]   Well, what about Project Loon?
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.120]   I was going to bring that up.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.360]   Like, they don't want to be a phone carrier.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.640]   They want to put balloons in the air.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.120]   In fact, now we know that there is a balloon that's
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.160]   been up for 200-some days.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.240]   It's traveled almost all the way around the world.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.080]   And I guess they're providing internet access
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.920]   via those weather balloons to--
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.280]   what is it?
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.280]   West Africa?
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:03.800]   So--
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.760]   A plant.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.880]   Yeah, Loon is still around.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.920]   It's not Kenya, I guess.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.640]   Well, just the last week out of the story,
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.240]   they were applying to actually provide it in some place.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.440]   Well--
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.520]   So now we've got Amazon, by the way, which just got FCC approval
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.680]   to put up hundreds of satellites for low-Earth orbit
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.080]   internet access.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.920]   12,000 satellites from Elon Musk's Starlink.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.800]   So I think that total is something like 15 or 16,000
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.720]   satellites with the two of them.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.440]   Then you're going to have lower balloons,
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.320]   but they're not there in those stratosphere, I think.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.440]   So they're going to be there pretty soon.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.120]   There won't be any sunlight.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.520]   It's--
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.560]   But we've got lots of internet.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   Quad.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.400]   Maybe a hell of a--
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.240]   --with the climate standard.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.840]   And I think that Facebook dropped its plans to fly--
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.800]   remember they had a drone that was going to provide internet.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.240]   A key to--
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:02.240]   Yes.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.800]   --15 minutes of service, yes.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.520]   Anyway, I do hope that actually I am kind of rooting
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.240]   for Elon and/or Amazon, because the idea of gigabit ethernet--
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.360]   a gigabit internet on every square foot of the planet
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.440]   is really attractive to me as a podcaster,
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.040]   because we could do the show anywhere.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.960]   You wouldn't have to worry about getting hotel internet
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.480]   anymore.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.040]   I don't think it would work.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   You don't think it would work?
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.840]   Because of latency?
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.440]   No, not latency, exactly.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.120]   But that's why they're low Earth orbit.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.720]   That improves the latency, but you're right.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   It's still more latency than landline.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.920]   Let's beta test.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.080]   OK.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.760]   I'll try it.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.520]   I'll be the first.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.520]   I'll be a gigany--
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.520]   I'll go over my house, Google.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.240]   If it's low Earth orbit, it's closer to you than--
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.400]   It might be than your central office or--
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.440]   --central office, possibly.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.640]   Might be.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:57.840]   Oh.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.280]   They claim pretty low latency.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.640]   I don't-- we'll see.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.840]   Yeah, I got to wait and see.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.080]   Elon's already-- he put up 60 star links,
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.320]   and they've already lost two of them.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   That's not--
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.320]   I have one.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.320]   That's one--
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.200]   --on my backyard.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.400]   Let me see if that's right.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.960]   I want to-- because when they first launched the 60 satellites,
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.960]   they said they had all of them.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:25.720]   But now, as of end of June, all but three, they have.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.320]   And two of them have been de-orbited.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.080]   That means what crashed into the atmosphere.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.200]   That de-orbited is like destroyed.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.960]   So I don't know.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.480]   Is that a good percentage or bad percentage of 3 out of 60
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.440]   fail?
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.960]   What you don't want is not so much failures fine.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.560]   You won't want to lose track of them.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.200]   You don't want to lose control of them,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.040]   because the key on these is that they don't run into anything.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.600]   You're going to put 12,000 bits of debris in the--
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.680]   and admittedly, there's a lot of space up there.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.360]   But you don't want them up there.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.560]   Final orbit will be 550 kilometers.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.960]   So it is still pretty distant.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.880]   That's still farther than your central office.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:17.120]   It's pretty-- you get to cruising altitude at 35,000 feet.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.280]   You figure high up.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.440]   So the reason that they crashed those two
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.040]   is they just-- there wasn't anything wrong with them.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.600]   They just wanted to test it.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.520]   They want to see if they could de-orbit.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.880]   So this is actually responsible.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.240]   They want to make sure that if it needed to,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.800]   that they could take the satellite and crash it
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.240]   in the atmosphere, which would burn it up, of course.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.160]   Five of the satellites still run into the atmosphere.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.600]   They had like still raising orbits.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.520]   Another 500 going into your systems checks.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   So it sounds--
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.960]   I told you the story of space lab in me.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.280]   Have I told you that's my show?
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:49.800]   No.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.960]   Space lab.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.480]   No?
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.280]   Space lab's the one that crashed into the atmosphere.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.280]   And it was a big deal.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.280]   And everybody said, oh, space lab's going to hit us.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.120]   And did you get hit by space lab?
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.440]   No, I was at the San Francisco Examiner.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.000]   And I offered $10,000 for the first person
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.520]   to arrive at our offices with a piece of Skylab.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.520]   Skylab, that's it.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.200]   Skylab.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.360]   And I called NASA and got their assurances.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.600]   This thing's falling over water.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.800]   No way you're paying.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.960]   Told the publisher.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.880]   No way we're paying.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.520]   You said it's safe.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.440]   So a 17-year-old beer truck helper named Stanford
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.240]   arrived at our offices with minutes to spare
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.320]   with pieces of Skylab.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.280]   Oh my god.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.080]   How much did you have to give him?
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.960]   $10,000.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.360]   And so we had to send one of our editors to Huntsville.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.760]   So did Phil Bronstein strangle you?
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.880]   He was gone.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.640]   He was out there yet.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.240]   Oh, OK.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.840]   Did Will Hurst strangle you?
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.800]   Well, it was Will's money.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.880]   It was Will's money.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.480]   So the publisher-- well, actually,
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.760]   it led to my departure from San Francisco.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.680]   It was like a lot more publicity than the publisher
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.680]   and the publisher.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.320]   Oh, awesome.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.280]   So we sent an editor to Huntsville
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.960]   who had to spend a week there waiting for NASA
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.360]   to authenticate these little black blobs.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.400]   It's so funny.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.080]   And there was much panic because they said,
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.880]   well, we can't find these elements in Skylab.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.840]   There's nothing organic in Skylab,
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.080]   except perhaps astronaut poop.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.800]   Oh my god.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.320]   So we thought for a while that it was astronaut poop.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.000]   Skylab coprolites.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.840]   But in fact, there was Balsa wood in the lining of Skylab.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.640]   What, really?
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.640]   Wow.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.560]   They verified that Skylab, we gave $10,000 to Young's Dantor.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.840]   Here you go.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.280]   Skylab.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.360]   This was our old newspaper war thing we did.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.280]   Oh my.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.120]   Watch this.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.360]   Will's 1979.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.960]   His 1979 lab is going to fall.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.120]   The experts still think it's going to happen
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.920]   around midday tomorrow.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.480]   But they won't know where until about two hours
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.040]   before the impact.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.680]   Our science correspondent, John Schone--
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.640]   I wish--
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.720]   Networking NASA still talk like that
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.680]   because I could get a job.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.280]   We don't know where Skylab will fall.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.240]   Skylab controls center at the map of the border.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.160]   I will be glad to grow that mustache.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.560]   It's easy to see this falling spacecraft
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.720]   has caught the world's imagination
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.200]   and attracted the world's press corps.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.440]   Reporters from Japan, Australia, and Canada
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.880]   are here to name just a few.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.360]   They're all studying maps and puzzling over orbital charts,
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.640]   wondering about the predictions on Skylab's fall.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.040]   And the story of Skylab's demise is being told
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.720]   in almost every language.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.400]   News was a more leisurely profession in those days.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.360]   But right now, Japan appears safe from Skylab.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.760]   However, Australia may be on the path.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.960]   And Canada and the United States seem to be prime targets.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.880]   Uh-oh.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.600]   What could well be Skylab's final orbit
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.640]   passes over parts of Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec,
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.560]   and Nova Scotia.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.160]   But space agency officials don't like to talk about all the land
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.400]   beneath Skylab on that final orbit.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.800]   No, they prefer to talk about all the water
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.000]   that will be under Skylab.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.400]   Well, it's a better chance it'll hit water.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.440]   That was what they told me.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.440]   It's going to hit the water.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.680]   It's just safe.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.280]   No chance, it's a real land, no chance.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.480]   I don't know what that was.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.000]   Because we shared a composing room with the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.160]   And we snooped on them and found out
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.640]   they were going to offer a Skylab insurance to Chronicle Reader.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.600]   If you died or lost a limb, you would get a payout for Chronicle.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.440]   If you were a subscriber, we thought-- so we sat there and said,
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.080]   what can we do to beat them to the punch?
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.040]   And we came up with the $10,000 for Skylab.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.760]   Brilliant.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.760]   And then we made fun of the Chronicle saying,
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.040]   for saying how dystopian they were, how negative they were.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   Yeah, you're positive.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.960]   We were positive.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.600]   We were positive.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.520]   We were on a reward.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.920]   Who was the publisher that did not like that?
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.560]   Give him some--
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.400]   Reg Murphy.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.240]   Reg.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.080]   Oh, Reg.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.840]   Where is he now?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.600]   I don't know.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.720]   He's buried somewhere with some astronaut poop.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.000]   So I still have a trophy with Skylab astronaut poop in it.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.360]   Can you actually have some Skylab?
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.000]   Probably the only one I planted, Dad.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.440]   You are so awesome.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.240]   So awesome.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.560]   All right, I think there's some Chromebook news.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.520]   And since Kevin's here, we're going to do that.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.040]   Hey.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.000]   We're going to do that.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.280]   And then we want to talk about a New Yorker article,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.160]   The Fight for the Future of YouTube.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.520]   I haven't read it yet, but I'm sure Jeff being the literate.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.640]   Oh, I have it either because I don't
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.640]   want to use my New Yorker articles for the month.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   Oh!
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   Oh!
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   Oh!
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.240]   I just don't want to talk about it or not.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.520]   The paywall strikes again.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.760]   Well, let's see.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.400]   I'll pull it up.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.120]   And then you can read it over my shoulder
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.360]   while I talk about it or sponsor today.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.000]   Actually, a good picture of Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.120]   She looks--
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.620]   Oh!
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.120]   --tough and ready to take on--
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.200]   It looks in charge.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.920]   --take on the challenge.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.600]   How neutral should a social media platform
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.200]   try to be?
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.040]   Oh, geez.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.760]   --the name of Jauromi.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.000]   Actually, we've had this conversation many times,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.440]   so we don't need to reprise it.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.400]   Our show today brought to you by a very confusing sponsor.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.000]   Now, I'll tell you why.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.800]   They're called Ahrefs, but they're spelled Ahrefs.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.880]   But that's OK, because if you know the web,
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.160]   you know what Ahrefs are, right?
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.800]   That's part of the linking system in HTML.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.720]   Ahrefs, or Ahrefs, as they call themselves,
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.560]   is an all-in-one SEO toolset that's here to help you
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.120]   and gives you the tools you need to rank your website in Google.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.000]   And this isn't snake oil SEO.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.400]   This is real stuff that really will help,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.920]   whether you work for a big brand or run your own small business
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   or even do a freelance work getting traffic to your website.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.520]   I actually have a friend who says, well, how do I
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.640]   get more people to go to my website?
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.800]   And the nice thing about Ahrefs is it's affordable enough.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.640]   I can point her to this.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.600]   For instance, they make competitive analysis easy.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.800]   She's a massage therapist in Sonoma.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.040]   And so she says, but there's--
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.920]   when I search for massage Sonoma, there's 20 people ahead of me.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.720]   Well, those are your competitors with Ahrefs tools.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.160]   You can show how they're getting traffic from Google
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.760]   and why you can see the pages and content that
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.720]   send your competitors the most searched traffic.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.520]   So you can see what it is people are looking for.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.480]   You can find out the exact-- and this is really helpful--
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.560]   the exact keywords your competitors are ranking for,
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.600]   which backlinks are helping them rank,
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.120]   because it's the backlinks that drive you up the ranking.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.400]   From there, you can replicate or improve on their strategies.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.640]   You now have that information about what's
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.680]   the other guy doing that they're beating us.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.760]   And if you're not getting significant search traffic,
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.680]   Ahrefs tools help you find topics worth creating pages for
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.360]   or content on.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.840]   You can easily see estimated search volumes,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.200]   gauge the traffic potential.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.400]   They have this great keywords explorer tool.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.440]   And if you are getting search traffic,
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.280]   data like their top pages report helps you
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.840]   know which of your pages are bringing in the most traffic.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.200]   That's what people want.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.560]   Give them more.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.440]   If you want more, check out the blog or the YouTube channel.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.360]   They've got some great tutorials on there.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.880]   And I say this is affordable.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.000]   It really is you can get a seven-day trial for only $7.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.120]   It's pronounced Ahrefs.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.280]   The A is silent.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.680]   I think this is such a great solution for people who
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.400]   don't want to spend a lot of money on some consultant who's
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.000]   going to do a lot of snake oil and hand waving.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.520]   This is real information that can really help you do a better
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.360]   job.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.960]   A-H-R-E-F-S dot com.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.200]   Ahrefs dot com.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.680]   Ah, the fight.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.760]   Quick program note.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.320]   Stacy will not be joining us.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.080]   Oh, OK.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.520]   She got tired.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.000]   Oh, oh.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.480]   You can still take an app if you want, Jeff.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:03.960]   It's OK.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:10.800]   This is really-- if you read this New Yorker article,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.120]   it really is what we've been talking about for weeks,
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.520]   months.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.440]   I mean, it's the whole story.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.120]   The ins and outs, the idea that radicalizes people,
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.440]   the problem with banning people, the problem
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.120]   with demonetizing people, YouTube's values.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.280]   What are they?
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.880]   Whether it should have values and how it should uphold them.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.000]   In fact, that seems to be a question that even YouTube
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.320]   hasn't really answered.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.720]   So I don't know if there's any answer in here.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.000]   But it's a good article if you want to survey of the stuff
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.800]   that we've been talking about all this time.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.640]   And why it's talking.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.840]   It's coming back to--
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.520]   I was at this lunch today at this academic conference.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.960]   And somebody said, what research should we do?
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.200]   And I said, the problem is that most of the discussion
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.280]   is around what does technology do to people.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.960]   And that's not the story.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.240]   It's how are people using technology for good and ill?
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.080]   And that's what I think the story of YouTube and Facebook
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.840]   and Twitter really is, is what we're doing.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.000]   It's the story of society today.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.320]   And regulation is an attempt to regulate our behavior.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.520]   And our good and bad stuff is about us, not the technology.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.400]   It doesn't make us do that.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.160]   We have agency.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.120]   We know what we're excited to do, including
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.600]   where we decide to be a-holes.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.960]   And so that's the issue.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.080]   Think about this.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.880]   We're trying to re-figure out how to regulate each other.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.160]   I honestly have become more and more to that opinion
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.440]   that nothing the platforms really can or maybe even should do.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:54.320]   It's up to us rejecting things we don't like and promote.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.800]   Now, one thing that they talk about in the New Yorker article
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.840]   is creators for change, the idea.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.920]   And a lot of companies are doing this
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:05.360]   of creating kind of a positive force, funding a positive force.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.000]   That's the kind of proactive, instead of reactive way,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.080]   to improve content on Facebook.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.080]   And there's some question about how well
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.440]   creators for change works.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.760]   It does put better content on there.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.240]   Which is critical.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.520]   Data Boy talks about the data voids that exist.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.680]   That's a trademark.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.920]   Data voids, data voids.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.360]   And one of the problems they have is you have things like PragerU
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.520]   up there making very slick right-wing videos.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.120]   Propaganda.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.120]   The propaganda.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.760]   Don't have things to counterpoint.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.000]   Right.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.160]   Counterpoint that with.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.240]   So that's exactly what they're talking about.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.120]   It's what they call counter speech, which is creating
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:55.240]   counterbalance to one side, just to give you content
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.000]   to counteract it.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.440]   But as we discussed the show before,
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.960]   nobody thinks they need to make a video saying
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.080]   that Holocaust happened.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.000]   Right.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.160]   But we need that.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.720]   That's one of the-- I think that the Green Brothers
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   are an important force.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.160]   Love what they're doing, in my view.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.760]   Because they make educational video about basic topics,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.320]   in some cases, that are explanatory,
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.840]   that create that kind of base.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.320]   We need more like that.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.840]   So I think a fairly good article on here.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.240]   So not dystopian?
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.480]   Not dystopian, and really just kind of more a survey
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.200]   of what's happened, what's been going on.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.720]   Did YouTube cooperate with it?
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.800]   Yes.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   And Namajaromi seems to--
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.400]   lately, they've got a lot of quotes in here,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:45.880]   cooperate.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.200]   I don't know what that means.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.920]   But in fact, there's a comment from YouTube
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.720]   on this about their hate speech rollout.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.080]   But he hates speech rollout.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.640]   But I think the creators for change is the big focus here.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.760]   And I think it's a very--
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.480]   And the issues of, OK, you can make those videos.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.960]   How do you surface them?
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.920]   This recommendation engine problem
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.680]   is a problem is not going to go away.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.480]   Because if you tweak it--
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.120]   If you tweak it to improve engagement,
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.120]   you're going to surface hateful stuff.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.360]   That's what engages people.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.680]   I have this discussion today at a newspaper company here,
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.480]   where a very bright executive said,
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.560]   the Trump bump was good.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.840]   Do we end up in a moral hazard of wishing for bad stuff?
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.080]   It's good for ratings.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.720]   That's what Les Moonves said, right?
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.760]   It's good for ratings.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.440]   It's good for America, but good for our business.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.080]   Yep.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.920]   And then here's an article from Casey Newton.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.200]   Once again, great piece from Casey and the Verge.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.240]   The pivot to privacy at Facebook
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.960]   is creating a problem, because now bad actors
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.800]   have private spaces together.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.280]   Well, what a shock.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.360]   And what do you want?
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.480]   You take them out of being under your nose.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.320]   You can't see them.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.680]   And now you can plan that you can't see them.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.680]   Le Monde, the French paper, Le Monde,
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.800]   found a group with 56,000 members
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.400]   devoted largely to making anti-female comments,
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   misogynist comments.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.160]   Of course, we have just heard about the Border Patrol
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.600]   group, a public-off found a group that's
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.800]   been operated for some time.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.720]   A Border Patrol agent is a secret, maybe not,
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.120]   but private group on Facebook joking about migrant deaths
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.200]   and making racist and just highly offensive comments.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.520]   So in other words, this is the other side of the face.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.560]   Yeah, you can go anonymous.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.320]   I honestly, given the choice between anonymous and public,
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.080]   I'd like to see the hate groups be public.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:47.840]   But then you--
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.800]   It's good to be at a point, yeah.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.840]   But then you have this problem of people being drawn to it.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.000]   It's so hard.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.120]   It's so hard.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.560]   I don't know what the right answer is.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:05.920]   Let's talk a little bit about the Chromebook.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:13.160]   So we can start with your article about Chrome OS 75, Kevin.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.400]   Yeah, what a debacle that's been.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.000]   So what happened?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.360]   I played that to us, Dr. Chrome.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.480]   Well, I can explain what happened.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.400]   I don't have all the details as to why it happened yet.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.360]   I've been waiting for it.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.680]   It started coming out last week, and then they pulled it.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.080]   Yeah, in fact, last week was actually already
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:37.800]   a couple weeks late, like two weeks late for no apparent reason.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:42.000]   But yes, it started to roll out, and then pretty quickly got pulled,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.200]   so the rollout stopped.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.400]   Now, I already had the version that they had rolled out.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.960]   I did not have any issues.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.920]   Then let's see.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.840]   They started rolling it out again to the Pixel Slate just
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.680]   late last week.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.280]   So they were working on the fixes.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.840]   The bugs were private.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.520]   Nobody knew anything.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.320]   I had asked Google for a response on what was going on,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.640]   and I got nothing.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.920]   It's been a week, week and a half,
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.120]   since I've been waiting for that.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.800]   Then finally, after the Pixel Slate started
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.480]   getting it a few days ago, just yesterday, I believe,
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.880]   is when everybody started getting it.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.920]   So I don't know.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.600]   I'd heard a lot of issues with the dev and beta channel
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.920]   versions of 75, and I did see some of them,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.240]   such as the Google Play Store would load.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.200]   But then when you try and get an app,
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.440]   it would say, I don't have internet connectivity.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.120]   That's obviously not good.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.160]   We've got people that had no access to their Linux containers
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:43.800]   at all.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.720]   And I mean, somebody like me, I use that every day for coding,
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.840]   and I'd be kind of screwed.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.760]   So there were definitely some issues that we know of,
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.480]   and I'm wondering if there are issues that we still don't know
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.160]   about yet.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:57.960]   Just relax.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.840]   74 is not the end of the world.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.600]   Just stick with it.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.160]   One was good in 75.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.960]   What should I be jealous that you have I don't have?
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.040]   Oh, well, I mean, one of the things in 75, Jeff,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.360]   is definitely geared towards the Pixel Slate,
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.080]   and that was they finally addressed and improved
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.640]   the animations and tablet modes.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:21.040]   They're not iPad Pro-like, but they're at least good,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.360]   I guess, is the best way to say it.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.760]   So there were some parental controls in 75.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.400]   Linux, you can access Android devices over USB.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.320]   So if you're routing your phone or you're
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.240]   putting custom ROMs on, you can do that from a Chromebook now.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:41.720]   One interesting thing, if you had any Android apps
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.280]   installed for cloud services, such as OneDrive,
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.880]   a couple of other ones, if you had the Android app installed,
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.520]   with 75, it actually shows up as a mounted drive
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.640]   in your files app.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.800]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.920]   Yeah, I get excited for the little stuff.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.480]   I don't know.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.760]   Hey, that's why you're the host of about Chromebooks.com.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.320]   There you go.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.040]   Oh, reader mode.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.360]   You get reader mode too, Jeff.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.080]   I like reader mode, actually.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.240]   The reader mode?
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.000]   So it strips away all of the ads and other superfluous
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.480]   content, so it's just the content that you want to read.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   I'm not crazy about that.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.200]   I'm an advertiser.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.480]   That's a publisher, right?
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.960]   Yeah, I understand.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.120]   Yeah, actually, Apple was the first to do this with Safari
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.800]   many years ago, and publishers didn't like it then.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.440]   But if Chrome does it, that's a big deal.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.920]   And it's actually a little surprising
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:39.040]   that Google would do this given their business model.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.280]   But I like it.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   I'm glad.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.520]   I look forward to that.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.720]   Will that go to Chrome as well besides Chrome OS?
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.080]   Will that be a part of Chrome?
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.560]   Yeah, that'll be on the Chrome browser for all platforms.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.080]   Nice.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.200]   It's funny that Apple got a lot of heat,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.960]   but because it was just Apple, I think people kind of--
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.000]   oh, well, that's Apple.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.880]   What are you going to do?
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.720]   But when Google does it, all right.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.360]   Yes.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.880]   Debian 10 buster.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.840]   Only Kevin cares about this.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.320]   But I got to--
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.280]   That's not true.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.120]   No.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.640]   So there were a couple of pages using this.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.200]   At least five.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.240]   So the deal with Project Krustini,
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.800]   which allows you to run Linux, kind of in a--
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.200]   it's a chorout, right?
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.680]   Is that how you run it in the--
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.160]   No, it's actually Linux is running in a virtual machine.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.360]   That's the crew time way.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:29.800]   OK.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.960]   Yeah, the Krustini is a Linux container running
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.400]   in a virtual machine.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.360]   Kind of like Docker a little bit or something like that.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.080]   And so you can-- this is--
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.520]   you can have different Linuxes, right?
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.320]   You get your choice.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.960]   You could.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.160]   One of the most popular Linux versions out there,
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.920]   it's one of my favorites, is Debian.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.160]   It's what Ubuntu and Mint and PopOS and a lot of other spins
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:53.880]   are based on.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.760]   It's kind of the community version of Linux.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.000]   Buster is the most recent version.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.320]   Came out July 6th.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.120]   But you can't get it on your Chromebook.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.040]   I guess does that mean Google does some stuff
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.480]   before they allow you to download it?
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.520]   Yeah, they do.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.640]   They actually created the custom VM for this tool work.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.920]   So they've got a lot of sandboxing
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.800]   between Chrome OS and the VM and the container.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.280]   So they've got a-- they can't just
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   slap an image in there and call it a day.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.400]   Because these things are interactive, right?
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.000]   You've got access to the Linux file system
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.200]   and the Chrome OS file system and so on.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.160]   So there's a lot of mojo going on there.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.720]   You can do it yourself, though.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.440]   There's, if you're really crazy, Kevin has an article.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.640]   Well, I was a little crazy.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.720]   It's only three commands.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.800]   I mean, it took me 15 minutes to do.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.280]   Everything seems to work.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.680]   But of course, I didn't test every single feature
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.240]   of Chrome OS and Christianity.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.320]   But yeah, you can just run three commands and do it yourself.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.640]   So I have Buster on one of my test Chromebooks.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.680]   It's working fine.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.040]   So you modify-- basically, you add it to your sources.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.280]   And then you can do the dist upgrade once you add it
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.520]   to your sources.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.680]   Bingo.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.840]   OK.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.960]   That sounds a little risky, but what the hell?
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.800]   Debbie.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.280]   I know.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.440]   Test machine.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:19.640]   Debbie has 45,000 apps that they maintain.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.120]   Wow.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.680]   So it is a significant--
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.000]   I know.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   If people sometimes say, well, I can't use Linux.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.600]   There's just not enough software for it.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   It's like, oh, yeah, there is.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.200]   But that's one of the issues with Debbie.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.080]   And that is a big project.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.240]   And there's a lot to do.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.560]   And it's all done by volunteers.
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:37.200]   And 45,000 apps, and they have to keep them all up to date.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.360]   And most importantly, security patches for all of them,
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.000]   that is not insignificant amount of work.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.840]   So I tip my hat to the Debbie in project.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.200]   Those guys do a great job.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.280]   That's a lot of work.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.760]   And if you use Ubuntu, or if you use Mint or PopOS,
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.160]   my current favorite distro, you should tip your hat to them,
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.000]   too, because I just reading a post from the PopOS,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.800]   guys, people said, well, why don't you just use Debbie
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.720]   and why do you use Ubuntu?
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.400]   And they said, well, because there's only a few of us.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.600]   And there's a lot of people.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.840]   So Ubuntu takes 45,000 packages,
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.680]   make sure all the security things are up to date
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.520]   and all that stuff.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.400]   And then PopOS can take the Ubuntu distro,
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.600]   you take advantage of it.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.760]   They're standing, everybody's standing.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.600]   This is how open source works since why it's so great.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.680]   Everybody stands on the shoulders of each other.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.520]   In fact, that's how Chromebook works.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.960]   Chrome OS is on Linux.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.280]   Is it a, what version of Linux is Chrome OS on?
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.360]   Is it their own?
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.200]   - That's a good question.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   I heard it was based on Gen 2 a while ago.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.760]   - Wouldn't it make sense?
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.600]   - Yeah.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.160]   Not 100% sure, but that's the trick
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.440]   with this whole Christianity thing.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.720]   There's Chrome OS on top of Linux.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.320]   So you don't know it, obviously.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.040]   It's just there, you're using Chrome OS, the interface.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.080]   But they use the same Linux kernel
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.040]   to try to kind of replicate or take advantage of
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.440]   in the Christianity container.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.640]   So it's all just one platform
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.840]   with all these things on top of it.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.320]   - Yeah.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.520]   Gen 2 is a good version to use
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.000]   because you built it as you kind of roll your own
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.920]   from the beginning on up.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.440]   And so the people who are doing Chrome OS can say,
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.920]   well, we're gonna put that in, but not that,
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.480]   but that in, but not that, stuff like that.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.960]   Let's see.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.800]   Stadia.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.520]   - You should do a Linux show.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.920]   - I really wanna, you could tell me,
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.560]   I kind of wanted to a Linux show.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.480]   (laughing)
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.800]   I mean, you know, we were--
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.640]   - Interesting about that though,
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.840]   is there aren't the kind of personalities and players?
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.640]   - Well, yeah, I think we could find them.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.880]   There's some really good Linux people on YouTube and stuff,
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.240]   but, and there's people like Doc Serals
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.760]   who writes for the Linux magazine who's--
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.360]   - But you don't have the kind of figure
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.400]   enjoying these days, which is the evil empires.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.320]   - Yeah, no, that's true.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.480]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   I think it would be more of a how-to show
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.280]   than it would be like this, a philosophical--
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.560]   - Which I would need.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.920]   - Yeah.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.560]   I am honestly of the opinion that Linux's dominance
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.120]   is now very clear and it's going to eventually
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.560]   just be the dominant operating system.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.360]   And I think it couldn't be a better time
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.480]   'cause proprietary, the problem with proprietary operating
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.440]   systems is you're then reliant upon some giant corporation
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.680]   to keep it up to date, to fix it, to keep it secure.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.720]   And that's not working so very well.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.520]   And I think the, at least operating systems
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.720]   should be not proprietary.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.600]   Okay, application software can be proprietary,
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.440]   but operating systems, they should be non-proprietary.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.120]   And I think Linux is a very good candidate,
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.720]   any Unix-based operating system, but that's--
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.040]   - Well, I like what you said, I think before the show,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.880]   did you predict that Windows will give up
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.280]   or Windows is something? - I think so.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.480]   There's no, Microsoft's money is no longer,
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.720]   used to be Microsoft made its money on Windows in office.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.760]   That was it.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.400]   And that was, you know, the fact that was the innovation
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.240]   that Bill Gates created, didn't the whole notion of
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   selling bits up until Bill Gates and Microsoft came along
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.680]   and started selling software.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.760]   Software was basically free, freely traded.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.400]   If it's, you try to make money on it,
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.800]   chances it would get pirated or very high.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.240]   It just was, it just, there was, nobody really thought
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.360]   you could make a business around software.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.280]   And Microsoft showed that you could,
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.760]   and you gotta give them credit,
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.960]   'cause if it weren't for Windows in the 90s,
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:23.800]   you know what I mean?
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.200]   They really powered the personal computer revolution.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.760]   Maybe not in the best direction,
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:29.680]   but they certainly powered it.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.400]   But now that we have an open source operating system,
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.760]   I think there's a great article,
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.680]   it's really kind of a, it's an essay by Neil Stevenson,
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.640]   one of my favorite authors that's 20 years old,
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.360]   but it's very germane today called,
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.800]   in the beginning was the command line.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.240]   And he talks about this in, I think,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.960]   a very observant and intelligent way.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.800]   And in the long run, operating systems are so fundamental
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.920]   and so basic that they should be free and open
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.680]   and widely available.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.400]   And the money should be made on top of them.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.000]   And that's really what Microsoft has done.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.800]   They have Windows, but honestly, their future is all in cloud.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.000]   It's all in Azure, it's all in services.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.400]   Even Apple is saying, well,
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.280]   we can't really sell any more iPhones.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:16.960]   So let's make our money on iPhone users and services.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.080]   That's where this is all moving.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.440]   And it's platform agnostic.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.720]   No, you know, that's why you can use a Chromebook, Jeff,
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.080]   because most of the stuff you're doing
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.000]   doesn't care what operating system you're using.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.520]   It's on the cloud.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.400]   - That's why I love it.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.080]   - Yeah, it's no longer the case that you have to have Windows
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.400]   or you have to have macOS.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.360]   - Well, it's the beauty of Chrome is that it's not an
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.280]   operating system.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.360]   - Right.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.560]   - Right, it's the un-operating system.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.320]   - Yeah, but it is writing.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.160]   - It's the mobile OS.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.120]   - It is writing, I mean, Chrome OS is writing
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.600]   on the open source.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.280]   And there's no reason why it shouldn't.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.600]   It'd be nuts to have made Chrome OS based on Microsoft Windows.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.920]   That would have been a horrible nightmare.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.760]   And look, look how this, we just talked about the Debian
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.600]   and then Ubuntu's running on Debian
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.800]   and then Papa is running on Ubuntu
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.480]   or Chrome OS is running on,
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.320]   can you imagine that happening in the proprietary
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.160]   operating system?
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.360]   It couldn't, it wouldn't, it wouldn't work.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.720]   The whole thing would be a house of cards.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.120]   It would have fallen down.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.520]   But because it's a really remarkable thing,
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.600]   it's one of the great remarkable success stories
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.960]   of technology, if you ask me, and other the internet.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.880]   You know what else is running on Linux?
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.960]   Stadia.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.680]   We're starting to learn a little bit more
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.640]   about their gaming play.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.160]   Well, that's probably a bad word to use in that context.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.720]   Their gaming platform.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.280]   There's an FAQ now in Google Support
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.360]   which talks about the sign up process.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.240]   It's coming in November.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.000]   A redemption code will be sent to the account
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.600]   used to purchase the founders edition.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.840]   If you bought that, a lot of people around here did,
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.280]   I did not.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.600]   Once you get that redemption, you did?
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.440]   Oh yeah.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.800]   Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.120]   'Cause you get the special controller,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.960]   you get a Chromecast Ultra,
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   you get a free game that nobody wants Destiny 2 or whatever.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.440]   - Three games of service.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.560]   - Gaming is a service.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.800]   But remember, Stadia, you have to buy all the titles.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.800]   You don't get any, at least there will be a free tier later,
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.280]   but right now you'll be buying whatever games you wanna play.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.040]   - The free tier, you'll still have to buy the games.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.880]   - You will.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.520]   - It's just free service.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.600]   - Please, okay.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.920]   - You buy the game and then you can play it.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.760]   - I know.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.400]   - You play on there.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.920]   - Here's a good question.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.560]   Do you own the game in the same way
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.960]   that if you went to GameStop and you bought a DVD
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.800]   and you took it home?
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.640]   - They have said publicly that even if the game company
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.440]   stops supporting Stadia,
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.000]   you will still own that game and be able to play it on Stadia.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.240]   - But only on Stadia.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.520]   - But only on Stadia.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.360]   - It's a Stadia game.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.280]   - So that's my question.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.880]   Is it like that or is it like the ebook you bought
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.160]   from Microsoft which last week Microsoft just turned off?
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.560]   - They say it is not like that.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.480]   - Yeah, BS.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.600]   - But yeah, yeah.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.160]   - Where are you gonna get the bits?
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.360]   We decided to kill Stadia.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.760]   Okay, can I have my game?
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.080]   What do you mean?
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.520]   Well, I want my game.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.840]   I bought this game.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.600]   And by the way, they're not cheap, right?
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.040]   They're the same price, they're 60 bucks.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:18.880]   - They're the same price.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.440]   - It's the same price as if you went to GameStop.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.840]   - Well, you'll get some discounts
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.920]   in the computer pro version.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.080]   - So this is Carson's got a really good insight in this
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.360]   and it's mostly because of Zach, your son, right?
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.600]   - All Stadia is you renting a computer.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.560]   - You're renting a computer in the cloud.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.400]   - From Google.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.240]   - Yeah.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.640]   And it's a more powerful computer,
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.360]   even potentially a gang of computers.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.200]   - Yes.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.040]   - Which you wouldn't own.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.280]   - It's a much better computer than I own.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.120]   - Yeah.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:44.960]   - And potentially--
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   - Which is really pretty cool.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.520]   - For things like video editing coming up.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.600]   - Well, this is all part of that same conversation.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.440]   Goodbye proprietary operating systems.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.520]   You will have a thin client in your house.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.760]   Doesn't need to be an operating system at all
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.880]   because your computer's in the cloud.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.720]   Now--
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.320]   - I can't wait for my spark box.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.920]   - Is this a spark box a thin client?
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.800]   - It's a sun joke.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.240]   - Yeah.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.960]   But didn't have like a processor and stuff.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.000]   - It did have a processor.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.920]   But it was a pretty thin client.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.560]   - Sinish, thinish client.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.120]   Actually, it's funny because
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:25.600]   Larry Ellison of Oracle fame
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.360]   started a thin client computer company called Think.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.560]   Do you remember this?
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.400]   In the--
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.240]   - Oh God, yes.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.400]   - Yeah.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.560]   - It was just too ahead of its time.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.040]   In fact, Gina Smith ran it.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.640]   And it was on a peer in San Francisco.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.000]   But it didn't go anywhere 'cause it was too soon.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.640]   Had he started it today, maybe.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.720]   And yet, there are a lot of us old timers who say,
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.240]   well, wait a minute, wasn't the whole personal
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.480]   computer revolution about getting away
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.480]   from the client server architecture
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.200]   and having a PC on our desk?
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.480]   Wasn't that the whole point?
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.560]   I get my own hard drive, my own processor,
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.240]   my own video card.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.920]   Have we abandoned that?
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.760]   - It was--
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.600]   - You can still do that.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.720]   - Everyone has access to a computer.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.360]   - Was it in that era,
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.640]   that was the easiest way to get access to a computer?
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.800]   In an era of ubiquitous bandwidth,
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.480]   maybe that's not no longer true.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.160]   - I think the real question, by the way,
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.480]   Google has addressed this a couple of times.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.600]   This is giving way too much power to the gatekeepers,
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.760]   the ISPs.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.840]   And you'd better believe Comcast is rubbing their
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.640]   gleeful little hands at the notion that,
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.240]   oh, you mean all computing will have to go through us?
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.080]   Oh.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.000]   (laughing)
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.280]   Aw, well, that's what an opportunity.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.160]   None of this works if you still have proprietary ISPs.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.480]   You also have to have some sort,
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:58.120]   I think you're gonna have to have a society run government.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.400]   I hate to use the word government, it scares people.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.400]   - Say municipal.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.240]   - Municipal, everybody loves their city.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.960]   You're gonna have to have some sort of public internet
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.120]   infrastructure because this is not working either.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.920]   This is another big discontinuity in this system.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.960]   And all of this relies on it.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.240]   Mobile devices, Stadia, according to the FAQ,
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.960]   will support the Pixel 3, oh boy.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:26.080]   Oh boy, the Pixel 3 3A for mobile gameplay
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.280]   and tablets running Chrome OS.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.800]   More devices available in the future.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.120]   So if you have an Android phone right now
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.680]   and you're thinking, oh, I can't wait.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.080]   Mm-mm.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.120]   Gotta have a Google.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.680]   - It's interesting they say tablets running Chrome OS.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.640]   Why not just any Chrome OS device?
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.480]   - Yeah.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.480]   - It is any Chrome OS device, but it's tablets.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.320]   - They have to touch.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.080]   - The only tablet that will run it
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.520]   is a tablet running Chrome OS.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.920]   - Oh, that's an interesting way to slice that, okay.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.760]   He went to Harvard, he learned how to force.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.760]   - Okay, like the mobile devices I see.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.360]   So Chromebooks will still be supported.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.600]   - It's all about sentence diagramming.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.200]   - He knows how to diagram something.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.880]   - Oh, things.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.520]   - I knew I shouldn't have skipped that class.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.080]   - Harvard team.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.600]   (laughing)
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.440]   - You learned that.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.280]   - I was talking about--
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.120]   - No, since I--
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.600]   - Since I write me to my kids.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.440]   - Since I write me to my kids.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.680]   - Yeah, sixth grade.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.760]   Yeah, you went to a good school.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.920]   I went to public school.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.240]   - Rabie arc public school in Helena Montana.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.400]   - Oh, well it's Helena Montana, that's why.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.240]   That's why.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.120]   At this time we have no news to--
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.320]   - You have no new--
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.520]   - Say again.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.040]   - Dryer's English.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.680]   It's a new book out from the copy editor of a random house.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.120]   - You told us about this and I'm buying, I think I bought it.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.480]   An utterly correct guy, a clarity in style.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.320]   Oh, you can't--
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.400]   - I was sorry, I was reading myself.
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:46.880]   - Yeah, no.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.720]   - You're gonna break.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.720]   - No, awesome.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.200]   Perfect graduation gift.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.840]   A sharp, funny grammar guide.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.600]   They'll actually want to read.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.480]   And this is, is this replacing Strunk and White?
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.600]   Is this the new?
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.440]   - God, I hope so.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.480]   - Was the Strunk and White with White wit?
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.320]   - Yes.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.160]   - What's wrong with--
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.600]   (laughing)
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.920]   - Strunk and White's fine.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.960]   - Stramp odds, fine.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.920]   (laughing)
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.080]   - Everybody's saying Strunk and what?
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:12.920]   - What do you do?
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.040]   - What you talking about?
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.640]   I'll get dryers.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.680]   - So I'm now reading a book about the dictionary wars
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:26.040]   of Webster's attempt to make the English language American
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.640]   versus Samuel Johnson.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.480]   - Oh, I love it.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.400]   What a great story.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   - It really is.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.240]   - What's the--
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.520]   - And post-revolutionary war,
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.440]   the prince looking down at us
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.200]   while we're doing to their language
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.960]   and that we'll never be able to understand
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.800]   each other in the future.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.080]   - Wow, I just, I will have dryers tomorrow.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:50.520]   One day delivery is now a reality on Amazon for me.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.360]   Wow.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.680]   - You have the history wars, that's the name.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.000]   - Is this the book?
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.320]   - The American fight over the English language.
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.160]   Nice.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.000]   - Oh, I want that.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.320]   - Peter Martin, Princeton University.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.160]   - Sorry.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.400]   - Yeah.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.240]   - This man reads--
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.680]   - I was reading that tonight.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.560]   With my queso fondido.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.400]   - Oh.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.960]   - Trying to make me not get grease on it.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.280]   (laughing)
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.520]   - Why not get grease on it?
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.200]   Then it shows you Reddit.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.680]   I break the spines, I write stuff in it,
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.800]   I want people to write stuff.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.640]   - I don't want grease.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.560]   I just, it's just like, you know, you slob you.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.080]   - This is not decorative.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.160]   Let's see.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.600]   What happens to a game I bought
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.120]   if the publisher stops supporting Stadia in the future?
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.080]   Yes.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.120]   Can you still play the game?
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:33.960]   Once you purchase it,
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.800]   you'll find the right to play it.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.160]   In the future, it's possible some games
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.840]   may no longer be available for new purchases.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.240]   Existing players will still be able to play the game.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.640]   So this means that they've made a deal
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.480]   with these publishers.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:48.600]   Look, no matter what, you gotta keep supporting this.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.520]   You're in, you're all in.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:54.320]   A Stadia account will support up to four Stadia controllers
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.640]   during local multiplayer gameplay.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.920]   This is the thing I was really interested in
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.080]   because they said that even with multiplayer,
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.560]   you might get multiple computers.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.040]   So everybody in the co-op game,
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.640]   this is one of the games, Get Packed.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:13.080]   It's their first exclusive coming next year with multiplayer.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.080]   - I'm just so happy that local multiplayer
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.320]   is making a resurgence.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.600]   - This is couch play, right?
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.440]   - Exactly.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.960]   This is like what families want.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.120]   - That's what I did when I was a kid.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:21.960]   - Yeah.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.560]   You'd play GoldenEye, right?
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.400]   - Exactly.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.640]   - Left side of the screen, it'd be you,
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.720]   right side be your opponent.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.480]   So this is, this is Aracha.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.480]   So this is, this looks like a Sims game.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.480]   - What is this?
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:39.440]   - What is this with games that simulate real life?
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.360]   This is very proper.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.520]   Apparently you have to push, oh wow.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.160]   - Oh, that's not cool.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.320]   - Yeah, there's incredible physics in this thing too.
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:52.280]   - Look at this.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.120]   - Oh, there you go, yeah.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.440]   - So this is couch play.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.280]   You could play it next to each other.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.440]   It looks kind of fun.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.040]   Actually, it looks like it kind of gave me laugh at, right?
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.200]   Oh, they even call it couch.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.040]   Couch an online co-op, four player carnage.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.840]   But it's not, it's a good kind of car.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.160]   Oh, don't get in that machine.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.240]   - Yeah, don't, yeah.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.800]   - Oh no, it could be about ridiculous physics.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.280]   Okay, so Goat Simulator was the first game I experienced
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.600]   where it was all about just kind of aimless crazy physics.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.360]   And this looks like it's kind of like that.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.040]   Get packed.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.320]   All right, from Coatsync.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.280]   All right, that's the first Stadia exclusive.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.680]   Yeah, I am glad two cars.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.840]   And I feel like this is something that we lost out on this.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.280]   Gamers became loners sitting by themselves
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.760]   in a darkened room, the rest of the family
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.200]   either in their darkened room or doing something else.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.160]   Now the family could play together again.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.840]   I think that's good.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.680]   I like it.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.520]   Let's take a break.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:59.040]   And we're going to talk about Amazon at 25.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.720]   Google's 20 Amazon's 25.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.160]   - We hardly do.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.440]   - They're starting to become, they're, they grow up so fast.
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:09.520]   They're moving out of that.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:10.600]   - They never leave.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.800]   - They never leave.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.400]   I showed it they brought to you by Cap, Terra.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:18.360]   Finding software for your business is complicated.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.440]   I understand nerve-wracking.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.680]   You've already got a program you're using.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.160]   Maybe it requires Windows Vista
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.120]   and Internet Explorer 8, but it works sort of
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.400]   except when it crashes.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.880]   And the kid who wrote it, he was in high school
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:32.760]   when he wrote it for you.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.520]   It was the son's, the boss's nephew's son.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.920]   But the problem with that is they're gone.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.080]   And your software, your whole business is running on it.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.840]   And I know this scenario plays itself out all the time,
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.200]   all over the country.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.880]   Cap, Terra is the solution.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.520]   There is state of the art, great software
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.680]   for every business just waiting for you.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.560]   Don't fear it.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.280]   Embrace it.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.920]   Embrace it.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.200]   Cap, Terra is the number one online resource
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.760]   to help you find the best software for your business,
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.400]   partly because they have every program.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.320]   700 categories, all the big ones,
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.160]   CRM, IT, Project Management,
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.480]   there's e-commerce, there's link management tools,
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.880]   there's web conferencing, but there's also,
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:15.880]   it's fun to look through.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.400]   Actually, I really like just browsing through
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.520]   Cap, Terra, load balancing software.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.920]   Let's see, there's a license management software,
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.320]   legal document management software, a lot of legal stuff.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.560]   There's yoga studio, here's legal billing software,
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.120]   you got a law practice.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.960]   Practice Panther Legal Software, there's one.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.440]   Actually, there's dozens.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.680]   But once you narrow it down,
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.560]   you can then filter the results by product rating,
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.960]   users, how many seats it can have,
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.760]   how it's deployed, whether it's on-premises
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.920]   or in the cloud, the features you need.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:53.720]   You can even compare side by side up to four programs.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.600]   They'll show you lists of related categories
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.560]   for further options, but the best part is the reviews.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.920]   Cap, Terra has nearly a million reviews.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.280]   Now, all of them vetted from real users,
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.720]   that's one of the things Cap, Terra does so well.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.960]   This is such a great resource.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:14.280]   30,000 new reviews every month, that's 1,000 a day.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.400]   That's awesome.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.600]   You can discover everything you need
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.400]   to make an informed choice.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.720]   950,000 user reviews,
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.480]   that means in a couple of months it'll hit a million.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.600]   This is so great.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.240]   No matter what kind of software your business needs,
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.560]   Cap, Terra makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.320]   And by the way, once you find the right software,
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.280]   leave a review, pay it forward, help everybody else out.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.800]   Now, you might say, well, that's pretty good.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.720]   How much is that gonna be?
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.760]   20 bucks a month, 25 bucks a month, $100.
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.600]   What is it gonna cost?
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:45.520]   It's free, it's free, free forever.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.520]   It's free free.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.880]   From accounting to zookeeping,
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.320]   Cap, Terra has every program you need.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:54.280]   Cap, Terra.com/twig, join the millions of people
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.080]   who used Cap, Terra last month to find the,
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.760]   yes, every month to find the right tools
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.800]   for their business.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:03.200]   C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A.com/twig.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.240]   What a resource.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.920]   What a great resource, Cap, Terra.com/twig,
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.000]   and it's absolutely free.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.280]   Cap, Terra is software selection simplified.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.920]   You can forget that software that the kid wrote
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.840]   20 years ago.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:24.920]   What about this Instagram plan to stop bullying
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:31.360]   by scanning the comments and warning you?
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.120]   Uh oh.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.800]   You're about to send a read.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.200]   You wanna say that?
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.120]   Yeah, we're asking people to rethink comments
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.200]   that seem similar to others that have been reported.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.960]   It doesn't even say there's snotty.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.440]   If we made a mistake, let us know.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.080]   Do you think that's gonna do anything?
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.280]   They say that it has had an impact.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.120]   Oh good.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:59.680]   So as a friend of mine at Oxford said in response,
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.320]   give us the data, nobody checks their own homework.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.200]   I mean, we have this on Twitter.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.320]   I use the thing that blocks offensive tweets and whatnot
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.800]   because I just don't wanna deal with it quite honestly.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.960]   Yeah, more valuable, of course.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.560]   The ability to restrict commenting from people
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.840]   that you don't.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.240]   And here's an interesting pop up.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.880]   Are you having a problem with this person?
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.480]   Protect yourself from unwanted interactions
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.600]   without them knowing only you and this person
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.620]   will be able to see their new comments.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.200]   They won't see when you're online
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.320]   or when you've read their messages.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.160]   That's kinda good.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.120]   So if you're getting stalked,
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:39.840]   I'm sure this is becoming a more of a problem on Instagram.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.320]   That's a good thing.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.240]   What the president can't do that.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.280]   Isn't that funny?
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.720]   Neither can AOC.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.640]   AOC can't either.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.320]   No public leader who is using one of these social platforms.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.320]   This is a court ruling that affirmed a lower court ruling.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.560]   I think it was-
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.960]   Sorry, the president, I'm going to the president.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.840]   But I think that that's the implication, right?
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.880]   If you're a public figure using a social network
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.280]   to post pronouncements,
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.800]   you can't block people from,
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.800]   we're commenting, that's part of the deal.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.600]   Right?
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.440]   That seems completely sensible.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.280]   Two-way street.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.560]   And I'm sure it would apply to AOC.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560]   She is-
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.200]   She has not officially applied to her yet,
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.560]   but she is being sued for blocking.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.240]   Right.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.920]   So does that also apply to bots?
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.200]   Can you block bots?
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:36.560]   I don't think two-
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.400]   Lots.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.240]   Bots don't have-
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.640]   Yeah, if you knew it was a bot,
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.960]   how do you know it's a bot?
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   Well, there's various mechanisms.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.160]   It's kind of hard to prove something's a bot, though.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.600]   It is.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.040]   There's a media freedom conference going on in London right now,
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.160]   a big deal conference yesterday today,
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.160]   and they blocked a bunch of-
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.240]   I have a deal of time I have ROT on this in a hotel room,
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.120]   and they blocked ROT in Sputnik.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.840]   Oh, wow.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.680]   Two-
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   Two-
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.760]   It's widely considered Russian propaganda news sources.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   I-
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.760]   Honestly, I read these stories,
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.200]   and then I go, I'm just glad I'm not on Instagram.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.760]   I'm just glad I'm not on Facebook.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.200]   Oh, shush.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.600]   That seems to me the right solution.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.520]   Just don't participate.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.800]   No, you're missing good things.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   You're missing AOC.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.680]   You're doing amazing things.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.680]   Mm-hmm.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.400]   I mean, at some point, the bad outweighs the good,
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.480]   but I'm not there yet,
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.560]   so I'm on all of these just to-
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.040]   No, it's somewhat a good outweighs the bad, Kevin.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.480]   (laughs)
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.320]   I'm on my-
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.400]   I'm a non-combatant,
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.160]   and I kind of enjoy that position.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.000]   (laughs)
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.720]   I just say, I don't care whether the bad is that way
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.560]   and the good, the good's that way and the bad,
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.520]   I just say goodbye.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.400]   And maybe that'll make it worse.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:00.360]   You see, that's one of the problems, by the way,
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.040]   with all, and this is historic.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.360]   This goes back to Usenet,
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.360]   and the Flame Wars Unused Net, and forums.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.800]   Anytime you start getting a lot of bad behavior,
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.400]   the good people don't fight back,
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.800]   they just leave.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.040]   They go, yeah, fine.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.320]   And so your garden is suddenly overgrown with weeds.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.960]   You don't have any flowers, you just have weeds.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.160]   And I think that that's kind of the inevitable
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.520]   devolution of a lot of social networks.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.200]   The Usenet was utterly destroyed by Flame Boss.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.040]   That's right.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.080]   That's right.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.440]   And I think that's true of a lot of fora.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.920]   And I don't know, you know.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   Maybe I'm not, maybe I should be a gardener
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   and getting in there, waiting in and weeding,
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.920]   putting good content in there.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.920]   We just need better tools too to ignore Ozos.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   To me, you know, for me,
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.920]   it's not a big political stance or anything.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   It's just, it's not good for me,
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   and I don't want to be there, period.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   I just don't like it.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.920]   I don't like it.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.920]   You're also public and you get stuff.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.920]   I mean, I, again, I do too.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:03.920]   Well, you do too.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   No, I really, I really don't as a rule.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   Except for your viewers, complain about my cameras.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.920]   You can take that.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:19.920]   Facebook tracked, did have a tool that would help it track
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   hoaxes and fake news about itself.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.920]   They, they shut it down a couple of years ago.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.920]   Storm Chaser and Night's Watch helped them track
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.920]   public sentiment over them.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.920]   Since 2016, Facebook employees have used Storm Chaser
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.920]   to track viral posts, including a popular conspiracy.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.920]   The company listens to users through their phone's microphone.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.920]   This is a story from Bloomberg, of course,
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   anonymous sources, three former employees.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   Storm Chaser is apparently one of multiple those
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.920]   Facebook has used to manage its reputation.
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.920]   But apparently they, they, they, they shut it down
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.920]   before anybody could say, "Hey, well, if you've got that,
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.920]   well, Facebook stopped using Storm Chaser to respond
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.920]   to memes in mid 2018, but they don't, they don't say why.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.920]   Actually, this is a Facebook spokesperson who said,
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   "We didn't use it to fight false news because that wasn't
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.920]   what it was built for, and it wouldn't have worked.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.920]   The tool was built with simple technology that helped us
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.920]   detect posts about Facebook based on keywords so we
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.920]   consider whether to respond to product confusion on our own
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.920]   platform."
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.920]   So don't think we knew how to stop fake news.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920]   We didn't.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:48.920]   Nothing to say here.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.920]   Move on.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.920]   Move on.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.920]   I'm, you got me reading about the E Foundation now.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920]   All this talk about privacy.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   We first started out with that big story with Google's
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920]   privacy and...
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.920]   What's the E Foundation?
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.920]   Oh, it's the un-googled phone.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:04.920]   Oh, it's a phone.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.920]   Hey, it's moved.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.920]   It's, it's a platform.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.920]   It's a de-googled platform.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.920]   And your data is your data as they say.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:14.920]   E dots.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   I was thinking about a foundation.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920]   I mean...
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.920]   So, but can you put this on your Android device?
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.920]   So you can put it on certain devices.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   It's a wrong.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   It's a wrong.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   It is.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   It is.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.920]   So it's an Android, but it's an un-googled Android.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.920]   Yeah, it's a OSP.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.920]   So the minute you put anything on there...
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.920]   Well, that's, that's the ultimate problem, isn't it?
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.920]   I mean, you're going to give up privacy to get the functionality
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   of the apps you want and use.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.920]   But it got me thinking, do I really need to be on all these
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920]   social media channels?
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.920]   Okay, no, I don't have to put them on there.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920]   There's an email app.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920]   There's...
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.920]   I mean, I could move off Gmail.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.920]   I mean, you use their stock apps, I guess you're safer.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.920]   But the minute you put your standard app on there, it's...
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.920]   You know, this is something Apple started to do with iOS 13.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.920]   I think it's really good.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.920]   And man, it's really scary.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.920]   I put iOS 13 on my iPad.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   It's going to be out in the fall, but they have a public beta today.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   And if you...
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.920]   What it'll say, pop up, hey, I just got...
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.920]   I can't remember, but let's say some app...
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:27.920]   Facebook has been tracking your location all the time.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920]   Here's the...
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.920]   Here's three locations it just told itself about.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.920]   It gives you a map, shows you the locations that some app that maybe
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.920]   doesn't even need location permissions, Netflix.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.920]   It's just sent back information to the home office and then gives you...
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:47.920]   Do you want to make this app only to get location information when it's running?
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.920]   Or do you want to leave it the way it is?
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.920]   I think that is a great solution from Apple.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   Thank you, Apple.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.920]   That is really good.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.920]   And it's very dramatic.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:01.920]   They've always done this, hey, this app is getting location information even when it's not running.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920]   You want to continue it.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:07.920]   But by putting a map in there, saying, here's the last locations that it just sent back to the home office,
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.920]   that is fantastic.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.920]   Good job, Apple.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.920]   Maybe that's a better way to do it because at...
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:20.920]   If you're going to take this eFoundation operating system, put it on your phone, great.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   But the minute you put hangouts on there or whatever, it's sending it back.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.920]   You might as well have a Google phone because anything you use, it's going to start sending it back.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.920]   You put Facebook on there, you've just breached it.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.920]   You've got to trust your app developers.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.920]   Yeah, so which one?
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.920]   They use in their example installing Telegram.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.920]   Now, what's good, each app in the store is scanned and analyzed.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.920]   So they do have their own app store.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.920]   And apparently you get information.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.920]   This is kind of cool about the app's privacy policy.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.920]   And what information?
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.920]   So maybe this is good.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.920]   I don't...
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.920]   This isn't going to be for the every jail.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:03.920]   Not for the masses.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.920]   But it does have a Maps app.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.920]   Okay, I'll get this.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.920]   And they do apparently come with Telegram as your messenger.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.920]   So, buy a Smart File.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.920]   Yeah, all 10 of you will be very happy with this.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920]   Yeah, that's very small.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.920]   Well, that's the thing, Jeff.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.920]   We all have concerns about privacy, rightfully so.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.920]   But yet we're not willing to go to the extreme, I guess, to address.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.920]   Our concerns are only so valid.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.920]   No, I do.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.920]   So a little breaking news here.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920]   Yes.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.920]   Washing reports.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.920]   The United States will investigate for possible unfair trade practices under Section 301 of the Trade Act
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.920]   over its initiative to slap new taxes on Google, Facebook, Amazon and other tech companies.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.920]   Who are they investigating?
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.920]   France?
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.920]   France.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.920]   The French measure, which is close to final approval, would levy a 3% tax on certain tech industry revenue earned inside France.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.920]   Other countries are considering similar taxes on big companies developing story.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.920]   Who's investigating France?
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.920]   The US?
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.920]   The United States is as part of a new transatlantic trade rift, says the Washington Post headline.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.920]   Oh my God.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.920]   This is all going to end in tears.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.920]   So now the US is investigating France.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.920]   Yes.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.920]   I mean, I don't blame them.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.920]   It's ridiculous what France is doing.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.920]   But this is the splitter net, right?
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.920]   This is where you have US internet, France internet, China internet, Russia internet.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.920]   And by the way, the good news is all the good companies work for us.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   You just can't trust anything.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920]   Whoops.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.920]   There's that whoops.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:50.120]   AT&T says it's going to automatically block robocalls soon.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.720]   New customers will get it immediately.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:59.920]   And then as you're, if you're an existing customer, they'll slowly roll it out.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.920]   That last call protects service.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.720]   Well, at last, maybe remember the FCC in June said that they could do this.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.040]   They prevented them in the past because of First Amendment concerns.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.880]   Phone companies have in the past.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.360]   I can't remember which phone company it was.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:22.200]   One of the big four blocked messages from narrow the National Abortion Rights Action League
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.800]   because it thought it was because it didn't agree politically.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.080]   So it's plain stuff to be boss.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:36.680]   How come, how is it through what mechanism is it that robocalls can now.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.080]   Ghost a apparently legitimate number.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.960]   Is that the big difference that's occurred?
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.320]   Well, for sure.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.320]   That's one of the big.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.320]   Here's a couple of things.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.800]   And this is kind of the same reason spam took over took off on email.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.960]   You can send email spam from any address, including what, you know, White House, US
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.720]   dot gov or whatever.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.080]   That's an easy, you know, the president of White House dot gov.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.840]   I can make this email message come from anybody.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:09.200]   That's because email has no built in authentication system and furthermore, email is really cheap.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.480]   So I can send out a million messages for pennies.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.640]   So the same technology that transformed email and made it a spam haven has made it now a
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.080]   haven on phone calls.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:24.480]   It costs very little to make a phone call virtually nothing thanks to IP networks.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.400]   And it is trivially simple.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.400]   You can do it.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.640]   Anybody can do it to spoof the calling number just as it was on email.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.800]   Fairly recent.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800]   It wasn't happening.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   It didn't happen.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.480]   It's only been moderately recently that that occur.
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.240]   The spoofing of numbers is occurred.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.720]   What changed that it was always there.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.960]   Same way it's always been in an email.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.200]   There's never been authentication systems.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.400]   It was always possible.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.640]   It just wasn't it got really easy.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   It got.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.280]   It wasn't easily easily.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:59.160]   I think the big change was things like asterisks was the idea that you could create a virtual
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.880]   switchboard of an IP based system.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:07.080]   It got very cheap to make phone calls from India to the US from China to the US.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.080]   It's basically the cost of calls is nil now because of the internet because of VoIP.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.280]   So combine that with the ability you've always had to spoof the calling number.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.800]   That's always been out there.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.680]   That's not a new thing.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.040]   Now there are proposals.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.240]   There's this shaken stir proposal for authentication.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.320]   That's an authentication proposal.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.080]   Inside of the conversation the phone carrier uses shaken to say this phone call is coming
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.360]   from our network.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:38.080]   It is a subscriber and then stir on the other end the incoming network saying, "Okay, yeah,
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.000]   that's validated in telling the recipient this is a valid authenticated email."
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.480]   Just like or a phone call, just like email would have some authentication through PGP
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.120]   or certificates or that kind of thing.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.000]   That's going to help a little bit.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.960]   I'm a little nervous about these call protect services.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:00.800]   As long as AT&T doesn't overreach and says, "Look, it says AT&T's call protect does three
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:01.800]   things.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.000]   It detects and blocks fraudulent calls entirely.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.480]   How do it know?
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.160]   Flags, telemarkers and spam calls a suspected spam when the phone rings.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.200]   That's fine and allows you to maintain a personal block list to specifically block individual
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.200]   numbers.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.920]   That's useless because as you point out, Jeff, the numbers are spoofed.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.920]   They're different every time.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.360]   It's meaningless.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.560]   You can block a number.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.680]   That doesn't do anything.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.960]   The real question and I don't think it's answered is, "How does AT&T determine that
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.880]   that's a fraudulent call?"
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.520]   This has been around for post-paid AT&T customers.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.760]   I didn't know this.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.040]   I didn't use it.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.480]   You'd have to download an app and enable it.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.880]   Now thanks to the FCC's ruling, the AT&T can ... This is the key.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.480]   The FCC says you don't have to get customers to opt in.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.320]   You can have it by default.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:57.280]   If you have AT&T, you can turn it on right now.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.240]   If you want, you can still receive all of your calls unfiltered.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.680]   AT&T will allow you to opt out of call protect.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.160]   The only thing that's really changing is it's default.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.520]   You're opted in by default.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.520]   T-Mobile has similar features.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.640]   I wonder what that app does that you have to install.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:19.840]   It's kind of like a gateway kind of thing that has been some verification.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.640]   There's a lot of apps out there right now, third-party apps like Truecaller,
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.040]   that have a database of fraudulent numbers.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.800]   But databases really aren't very useful because, as we said,
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.720]   the numbers can rotate per call.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.960]   I just don't understand why they can't do it on the network.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.600]   So it might have to be an app.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.080]   What do you do that for?
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:44.320]   Yesterday or the day before yesterday, I got a call from Jerry that he did not send me.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.240]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.480]   So now it's spoofing calls from people you know.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.200]   How does it know that?
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.080]   I don't know.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.480]   That's the worst kind of email spam, of course.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.880]   In fact, that's where spearfishing and phishing emails are really deadly
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.240]   is when it comes from the boss, you're going to open it.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.720]   And you can't ignore a call from Jerry, right?
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.640]   Right.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.880]   Well, I did because I was driving.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.880]   I always ignore Jerry's calls anyway.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   I did.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.720]   Now, that concerns me that somehow they have your contact list.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.520]   That was weird.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.360]   That was, I did not like it.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.360]   So that's illegal.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.240]   Neighbors spoofing is illegal, but none of these people are in the US, so it's very
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.240]   hard to prosecute.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.240]   Right.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:31.080]   I get a lot of calls on my mobile using my home area code and extreme.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.280]   Yeah, that's called neighbor spoofing.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.280]   And one of the...
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:38.360]   What is it now for my mobile number that that's to be at home?
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.920]   I don't know.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.920]   That's a good question.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.440]   Location and information where that mobile phone is most of the time.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   Oh, that's scary.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.240]   Oh, most of the time.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:53.120]   So that's why I use, as my public number, a Google voice number out of Baltimore.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:58.000]   Because if I get a call from Baltimore, I know it's spam.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.520]   I don't know anybody in Baltimore.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.800]   That's kind of a simple hack, which is get a Google voice number with an area code that's
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.240]   not, you know, any anywhere you know.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:14.400]   It's from Wisconsin.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.880]   So you do the same thing?
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.880]   Yep.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.880]   Oh, clever.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.320]   All right.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:26.120]   So the US is investigating France.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:30.680]   And the White House is having a social media summit, but neglected to invite Facebook or
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.480]   Twitter.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.520]   That's tomorrow.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:41.040]   Basically, CNN says it's going to be a right-wing grievance session.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.880]   It's not really aimed at discussing the issues facing social networks.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.080]   It's just a chance for...
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.960]   I wonder what our G will be there.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.960]   Bring the Russians.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.840]   They probably have something to say about this.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:57.640]   Who is going to be there if Twitter and Facebook are not invited?
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.560]   Washington Post reported last week the White House has asked the event a number of right-wing
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:05.960]   luminaries who have been extremely critical of social media.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.920]   Of course, even the president has been fairly critical of social media.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:15.080]   We played that interview with Maria Bartiromo on CNBC in which he said Twitter has been
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:20.160]   very unfair to him.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:26.200]   Republican lawmakers and conservative media personalities won't see Jack Dorsey there.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.560]   You won't see Mark Zuckerberg there.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.440]   And frankly, did they want to go there?
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.040]   Oh, Diamond and Silk, maybe.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.040]   That'd be good.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.040]   Bring them in.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.040]   Oh, God.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.040]   Wow.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.040]   All right.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:43.840]   Well, one more thing to ignore.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:49.520]   You asked earlier about how to deal with trolls.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.240]   How do you ignore the deuce?
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.880]   No, I don't.
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.360]   Okay.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.600]   Highly recommends.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.400]   I know you appear regularly on MSNBC.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.160]   Watch 24-hour news.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.640]   This is a poison, a blight on American society.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.960]   You don't know what's going on.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:08.960]   It does not.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.720]   It's not what's going on because it's a 24-hour news cycle.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:17.480]   It is a it is a they are scavenging the world for breaking.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.960]   Everybody's breaking news.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.640]   Read the news paper.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.640]   Read the newspaper.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.920]   You don't you don't need to watch it on TV.
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.880]   It's treats about what's happening to little brown.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.880]   I agree.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.880]   And you can know about that.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.000]   Because we're into it.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.400]   Well, some people are watching.
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.400]   Because we're selfish.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.240]   You know, we our generation was out there.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.440]   That was frankly, I go to Vietnam.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.680]   I agree.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.640]   But that's because we were going to get sent.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.040]   That's because we were getting drafted.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.760]   No, I've been thinking about that.
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.080]   This is an easy one to ignore.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.400]   Just as the concentrator.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.640]   This is Dachau was easy to ignore.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.800]   Auschwitz was easy to ignore.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.280]   No, I think it's shameful.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.520]   And I don't I don't I guess we should all be going down to Brownsville.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.520]   I don't know.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.520]   I don't know what you do about this.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.560]   You gotta stay informed about this.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:10.240]   Well, but not by watching MSNBC and CNN or Fox by by reading the newspaper reading magazines.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.840]   It doesn't need to you don't need a 24-hour news cycle.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.640]   That's just going to get grinding you down.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.720]   I think 24-hour news cycles are very, very bad thing.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.440]   Reality is grinding us down.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.440]   Well, that's true.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.880]   But you're it's because you watch too much 24-hour news.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:30.040]   It's you don't need it all the time.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.560]   It's going to kill your limbic system.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.320]   You're just going to you're going to be you're going to be.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:39.520]   No, I just say Rachel Maddow and Nicole Wallace and Joy Reed.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.520]   Keep me sane.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.840]   They're wonderful people, but they are not keeping you sane.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:49.240]   And it's it's more than just that it's 24 hours.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.480]   It's that it's it's it's heightened.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.920]   Sensationalize everything is sensational.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.280]   Everything has to be all breaking news.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:04.720]   It has to be it has to fit into a three minute and 33 second.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:07.680]   Not Nicole Wallace or Rachel Maddow.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.760]   That's not my criticism of it.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:12.680]   In fact, it's kind of the opposite Carson is that sometimes they'll spend eight hours
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:15.760]   on the simplest little typo.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:19.880]   You know, I mean they can the problem with 24-hour news is as you well know because we
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.920]   had to do it on tech TV.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.680]   You got to fill.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680]   You got to fill.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:29.640]   And in order to keep people watching, everything has to be red light five alarm fire.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.680]   It has to be breaking news.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:32.680]   They never take breaking.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.760]   It's a farm alarm fire.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:37.600]   No, because you're watching children at the door.
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.600]   I agree.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.600]   It's a horrible thing.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.600]   We should all be doing something about that.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.280]   When everything is a five alarm fire, nothing is right.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:49.880]   But you know, so my old friend, Eugene Carroll's story went nowhere.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.280]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.280]   Right.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.280]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:59.040]   But it did go somewhere if you were thoughtfully reading news sources as opposed to trying
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.480]   to watch 24-hour news.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:07.280]   The time's buried it, but then they admittedly and they mishandled it, absolutely.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.520]   But they don't, but they have covered it since.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:13.160]   And I should point out that MSNBC's moved on as well.
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:19.960]   The 24-hour news cycle is not conducive to long-term cogitation.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:23.440]   Thomas Day.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.400]   And you know, now they're all on Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:28.320]   It's all about Epstein, right?
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:35.720]   Yeah, well, I didn't know that I knew he's a legend, Madam.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.680]   See, you're involved.
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.480]   Now everybody's involved.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   Looks called Glenn Maxwell.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.280]   Former TV guide critic, nose.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.560]   Jeffrey Epstein's, Madam.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.920]   Alleged, Madam.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:51.080]   Alleged, Madam.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.120]   The daughter of Robert Maxwell.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.120]   Was she a young man?
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.400]   She's of Contemporous, A.S.H.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:03.760]   The daughter of Robert Maxwell, who bought the New York Daily News when I was there.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:10.440]   FCC, let's get some, I try not to be sensationalistic, but this is kind of hard when not to be
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:16.240]   the FCC just killed part of San Francisco's broadband competition law.
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:23.400]   FCC has preempted, so you didn't know this, but the FCC can preempt local laws.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.400]   It's a law.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.320]   So in San Francisco, we were just talking about this a little bit with Google Fiber.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:34.160]   In an apartment building or any multi-tenant-structure, generally what happens is the owner of the
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:41.320]   building negotiates with a single ISP to provide internet for that entire building.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:47.240]   San Francisco passed a law, Article 52, which says service providers, just as they do right
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:52.600]   now with DSL, have access to the existing wiring inside multi-unit buildings, even if
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.520]   there's already an incumbent ISP serving the building.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.800]   The FCC says, nah, nah, nah.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.160]   It's preempting the law to the extent it requires the sharing of in-use wiring.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:11.240]   In other words, the entire law.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:15.520]   San Francisco told the FCC its law doesn't apply to in-use wiring, and the law's text
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.240]   never uses the phrases in-use.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.240]   Oh, I see.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.760]   In-use is the key phrase.
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.000]   It applies to any existing wiring.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.680]   The FCC says that could be interpreted, including wiring that's actively being used by another
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.680]   ISP.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:35.120]   And of course, what you don't want is a competing ISP to come in and unplug the incumbent ISP.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:39.160]   The point of the law is to give residents some competition, a chance to switch ISPs.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.880]   If you're in a big apartment building, and almost anywhere in the country, you have one
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.960]   choice, the provider of that building.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.960]   That's it.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.960]   You don't have a choice of price.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960]   You don't have a choice of provider.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.960]   That's it.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:56.040]   I think this is at least a well-intentioned law.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:01.280]   Jip Pai claims the ambiguity over whether the law does allow simultaneous use of wires
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.880]   is enough reason to preempt the law.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.600]   But of course, we know.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:18.320]   We know the real reason, because the FCC never met a telecom company it didn't love.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:25.880]   The House of Representatives, by the way, voted to block a prize proposal on June 26th.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.640]   But in order, of course, to make that law pass, you'd have to get through something called
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:35.240]   the House of Lords, aka the US Senate.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:42.960]   And the king, President Trump, would also have to agree in that he's going to happen.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.680]   I'm not familiar with the San Francisco Housing Market, as well as you would be Leo.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:50.000]   He's all rentals for the most part now.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.360]   Well, a lot of rentals, yeah.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.120]   I'm just thinking about the broadband.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.440]   And a lot of multi-tenant, right?
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.440]   Right.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.440]   Right.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:04.480]   And as I said, O'Malley, who lived in a high rise, I think, loved his ISP.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.040]   But he didn't have a choice.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.320]   I guess if there were wireless providers, I think maybe 5G will solve this.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.600]   If you get high-speed wireless, then there's no wires.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.480]   It's not going to work through buildings, I thought.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.560]   Well, you could put something in the window.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.560]   5G will fix this.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.560]   5G will not fix this.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:23.840]   And if it doesn't, Elon Musk's Starlink will fix this.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.080]   That satellites will fix this.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.080]   5G will not fix this.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.080]   Wireless will fix it.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:34.120]   5G is just a, just for home is just a last mile thing.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.120]   Project Loon.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:40.360]   Project Loon will totally fix this.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:52.080]   25 years old this week, Amazon, and a great BBC piece showing the numbers, the numbers,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:59.000]   the Amazon Empire, online sales 2018, $234 billion.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.440]   It's going to get it all though, right?
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440]   This is what worries me.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.600]   I bookmarkedwallmarked.com just because I don't want Amazon to get it.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.880]   I think that we need some competition.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.160]   And I know, I'm myself, I just immediately go to Amazon.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.160]   Exactly.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.520]   Yeah, I go to Amazon right away.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520]   It's default.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.520]   Pure as the driven snow.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:26.520]   There was a straight long read this week about grocery stores just fury the future.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   Oh, yes.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.800]   Trying to redesign all those experiences.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.440]   We went to buy furniture at a brick and mortar store over the weekend and they couldn't
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.440]   even...
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.440]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.440]   It was a big...
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.760]   Yeah, well, it was Freedman's Lumber.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:40.960]   It was like a big hardware store.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:45.080]   They could barely be bothered to help us.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.920]   Yeah, it's over there.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.880]   And honestly, it's just a brick and mortars dying.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.880]   No.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:57.560]   7.7% of all retail in the United States goes to Amazon.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.720]   That's a pretty hefty number.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.360]   And it's only going up.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.640]   199 average monthly US uniques.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   How many people are in the US?
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.640]   That's like...
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.960]   It's like almost everybody.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:15.880]   330 million people, 200 million of them, and visiting Amazon.
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:23.680]   100 million prime subscribers, 24 million echoes sold, 12 million fire tablets sold.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:27.520]   They sell 88.9% of all e-books.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.320]   42% of all physical books.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:36.080]   I just bought a physical book from Amazon, not from Walmart.
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:41.400]   So I wrote a group of media people who were trying to do commerce.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.600]   And they recognized that just as they were stuck with Google for traffic and Facebook
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.000]   for users, they're stuck with Amazon for commerce.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.440]   And the thing that tends to drive conversion for a commerce offering on their sites more
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.040]   than anything else is if it says "brant."
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040]   Mm-hmm.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.120]   Is there anything that's not prime on Amazon?
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.720]   It's silly that I...
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:12.400]   And that book that I bought, because you told me to buy it, the English book, one day delivery.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:13.400]   It's coming tomorrow.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.320]   I'm surprised it's not already at your house.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.320]   It probably is.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.760]   I'll probably go home and it'll be there.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.440]   And can I tell you, we still have an independent bookstore in Petaluma, Copperfields.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:27.760]   But when I went in there to get a best seller that had just come out, last few days, I
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.560]   said, "Yeah, we don't have it yet."
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.200]   Because they're shipping a big box from the publisher.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.320]   They'll get it in a week.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.000]   I'll have it tomorrow from Amazon.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000]   It's pretty hard.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   We're trying the opposite.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.640]   When I go down to the Princeton bookstore, they tend to have books before Amazon.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.640]   That's probably finally the rules.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.640]   Oh.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.640]   But you can get them.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.640]   They've been stores now.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:51.640]   I find that you can get them before you count them.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.680]   Prime Day is coming up in about a week.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:58.400]   That is a big two-day event.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:03.800]   The biggest, I think, one of the biggest e-commerce days of the year at Amazon.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:07.240]   Amazon warehouse workers in Minnesota are going to strike.
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.240]   100 employees.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.440]   I think you're stuffing one day.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.440]   Yep.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.080]   Or you can't put another warehouse.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:23.240]   So Amazon says, "We're already giving them plenty of money."
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.600]   Because people walk an awful lot.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.600]   They do.
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.600]   15 or 18 miles.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.600]   15 or 18 miles.
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:29.600]   That's pretty hard.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.600]   Yep.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:34.960]   Amazon did confirm that unless you explicitly delete your Echo recordings, they keep them
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:35.960]   forever.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.320]   I didn't think otherwise.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:43.600]   But maybe they'll change that now that everybody knows.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:47.160]   This was in a response to a letter from Chris Coons of Delaware.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:52.320]   Senator Coons asked, "How does Amazon use and retain customers' Echo voice assistant
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.320]   data?
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:57.440]   We retain customers' voice recordings and transcripts until the customer chooses to
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.640]   delete them."
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.640]   Period.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:00.720]   But they still keep a body.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.700]   But they still keep the body.
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.600]   But even then, they're exceptions.
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:10.280]   Metadata skills, third-party-developed skills, they keep the information.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.480]   Well, you know, that's-- The foundation.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.720]   I'm telling you, the foundation.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.560]   If you have an Echo, did you think otherwise?
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.560]   No.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.800]   I mean, you're putting a microphone in your house.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:22.800]   You know you are.
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:25.800]   So can you complain about it later?
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:26.800]   No.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.640]   Do I have a change log here?
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.640]   Yes, I do.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:34.800]   Let's do the change log, and we can go home.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.680]   Oh, change log.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:38.880]   It's the UGL change log, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.160]   You can help us select me up.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.360]   Prime video, Amazon.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:49.360]   Now on Chromecast and Android TV plus YouTube on Fire TV.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:55.760]   Some deal with the devil has been made between Google and Amazon.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.240]   You can watch Amazon Prime video now on your Chromecast and Android TV devices.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:03.080]   No mention of the Echo Show devices.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.360]   Oh, I want-- Yeah, because that was a big problem, right?
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.960]   There was a big battle over YouTube.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:11.880]   And Amazon didn't like the YouTube app that-- and then YouTube said, well, you're not doing
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.560]   it right, and then it's gone.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:17.160]   I would like it on my Echo Show.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:20.160]   I would like that.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:26.080]   Google is making night sight one of the main camera modes on Pixel phones.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:32.720]   So as you probably know, when you have a Pixel and you go to the phone, there's some
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:37.320]   defaults, some choices that are always visible and then there's more.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:42.880]   They're going to take panorama, shove it back into more, and make night sight because that's
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.880]   the spark.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.960]   Yeah, that's like the thing that this phone does better than anything.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:49.120]   I take every photo with night sight on.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:51.360]   Daytime night-- no, seriously.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.360]   Really?
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:57.400]   So now it's night sight portrait camera, video, and more.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:02.640]   And more has panorama, photosphere, photo booths, slow motion, time lapse, playground,
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:06.040]   lens settings, and so forth.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:11.960]   I look forward to getting an update to my Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:18.800]   Apparently the June update enhances its low light photography to be roughly equal to Google's
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.960]   will see.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:26.200]   Google's testing a play button for Chrome's toolbar.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.440]   Do you want a play button on your toolbar?
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:31.040]   I don't.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.040]   I don't.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.640]   Where will it be?
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.520]   Right here.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.520]   Hmm.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.840]   That's going to-- I don't get it.
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.800]   Is it to play whatever videos on that page?
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.560]   I guess it must be.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.960]   Those videos play anyway.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:46.800]   I want to not play button.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.160]   I want to stop button.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.160]   That's what I want.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.640]   It's in Canary now.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.800]   You can mute the tabs or the sites.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:02.520]   Yeah, I actually use Brave, which is a chromium adaptation that automatically stops that stuff.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.960]   Although lately I've been thinking about switching to Firefox because I'm worried about-- Brave
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:12.200]   has other agenda, including its own cryptocurrency batch.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.600]   It's really bad.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.240]   So I'm thinking maybe I'd be better off--
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:19.240]   With the open web.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.640]   With Firefox, the open one.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:21.640]   Do you use Firefox?
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.080]   No, you use Chrome because you're on Chrome OS.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.080]   Yep.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.080]   You have to.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.160]   Unless I use an Android browser.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.520]   And do you use Firefox on Android?
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:32.520]   No.
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:33.520]   No.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.520]   Use Chrome.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:35.520]   Okay.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.520]   Dischrome.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.520]   Dischrome.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.360]   Beta 5 is out.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.760]   I'll leave that to you to install.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.760]   I have it on my Pixel.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:44.240]   But honestly, it's been so shaky.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:48.280]   I don't even use the Pixel anymore because the betas are kind of rocky.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.320]   So once they settle down, they'll go back.
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:54.080]   Google has a live camera translation.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:57.040]   They've talked about that before at I/O.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:03.560]   It's now getting smarter and 60 new languages.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:05.200]   So that's pretty good.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.480]   I don't think either of the translation side has to be English anymore either.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.480]   It used to.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.480]   Oh, nice.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.120]   So you could do whatever to whatever or not.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.120]   That's the cool thing.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.160]   It can go from whatever to whatever.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.920]   New languages include Afrikaans, Arabic, Bengali.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.760]   That's going to be useful for me when I go to the Middle East.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:28.000]   Bengali, Estonian, Greek, Hindi, Igbo, Javanese, Kurdish, Latin, Latin.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   Mm.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.320]   Do you see Latin signs a lot?
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   Maybe in Pompeii.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.320]   Latin.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.120]   Latvian, Malay, Mongolian, Nepali, Pangali.
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.040]   I told you Carston will use it.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.040]   Carston.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:46.080]   I actually never took Latin, but my wife did.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.080]   Oh.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.680]   I took two of them.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.680]   Post-Hawk.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:50.680]   Ergo.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:51.680]   Proptere.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.680]   Hock.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.680]   Mm-hmm.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.680]   That's Latin.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:58.520]   Hech hech hech hech.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.760]   Weus, weus, weus.
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.760]   Wech, wech, wech, wech.
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.760]   Conconco.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.840]   Oubi, Oubi, Smee, Sububi.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.360]   That's all I know.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.720]   And that's just because it says "Bubi" in it.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.280]   Yeah, I know.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.280]   Schoolboys.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:14.200]   I didn't know about this.
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.120]   I'm not happy.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.120]   I'm not happy.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.520]   Google Drive and Photos Sync goes away today.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.520]   It's gone.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.520]   Yeah, it's gone.
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.520]   Very happy.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.040]   It's already very happy about it.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.040]   Yeah, you're happy.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:27.200]   The problem is all these photos I never meant to sync.
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.400]   Oh, because they were on Drive.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.400]   Okay.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.720]   I'm going to drive because it will kill them in Photos.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.720]   Okay.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.720]   Okay, good.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.560]   So you get the backup and sync for your desktop.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.920]   I do use that.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:47.400]   And that gets all my, you know, my good DSLR photos up in the Google Photos interface.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:50.360]   And then you're going to have a new option in the Photos web interface that lets you
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:53.400]   choose the pictures from Google Drive you'd like to put on Photos.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:54.400]   So that's good.
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.800]   Yeah, that's better than automatic.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.720]   I like that.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:05.400]   Google has recreated, if you've got AR in search, I guess everybody does, you can now
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:10.000]   visit the Apollo 11 cockpit for the 50th anniversary.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.640]   So what do I have to search for to do that?
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:13.880]   This is launched today.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.600]   It's the AR experience.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:20.320]   Place users in a 3D creation of the Apollo 11 command module.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.880]   Oh, look, that's cool.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:22.880]   That's--
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.640]   Oh, and then you can put it in your own space as well and walk around it.
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:33.640]   I love commemorations of this because honestly, I know this was 50 years ago.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:37.560]   It's the best thing we ever did in my lifetime anyway.
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:41.080]   You think they could have cleaned off the capsule a little bit?
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.760]   Oh, no, no, that's because it came through the Earth's atmosphere.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.280]   It got some flames.
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.800]   It looks a little rusty, doesn't it, though?
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.080]   Maybe you walk around inside it.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.640]   Yeah, apparently you can get in.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.840]   So this month, Neil Armstrong's spacesuit.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.320]   And you can see what it's like to be in this spacesuit.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.360]   I think this is cool.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.360]   This is cool.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.400]   Here's a glove.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:09.600]   The EVA glove.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.560]   Well, that's cool.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.720]   Does not look very comfortable.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.920]   What a duct tape on that.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.000]   What a duct tape.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.400]   Hold that tape together.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:24.080]   This is the repairs in the beta cloth medical container.
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:28.480]   This is John Wilkins, 17th century manuscript.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.520]   This is, I don't know how that got in there.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:35.360]   Here's Rheatha Clark, king of physical chemist and principal investigator, contracted to
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:40.920]   work with NASA to study select chemicals of special interest for rocket fuel.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.160]   Rocket fuel investigator right up there with the glove.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:46.320]   It's an interesting mix of photos.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.320]   I don't get it.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:56.440]   And finally, Google Nest is killing its smartwatch apps for WearOS and Apple Watch.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:59.240]   Nest is no longer supported for WearOS.
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:05.280]   This is, of course, goes along with the replacing of Nest.com with a new Google Nest.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.160]   I think this is a mistake.
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.960]   Will they have a new app to replace it?
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:10.960]   I don't know.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:13.600]   I threw this on there because, again, I think it's a mistake.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:21.680]   There are times when voice works great in the home and so on to turn the thermostat
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.000]   up or down or whatever.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.880]   There are times when voice does not, though.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:31.080]   If I'm watching TV, my voice falling asleep, I don't want to shout out, "Hey, turn the air
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.920]   conditioning up."
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.080]   Something on my phone, something on my wrist.
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.080]   You have to fire up your phone.
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:36.080]   You can't do it on your watch.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:41.120]   You're going to Google only a small number of people use the watch apps.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.120]   So they're going to do mobile apps and the assistant.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:46.160]   That could be true of any Google Watch app.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:51.120]   I was going to say, small number of people actually using WearOS apps.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.120]   WearOS.
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:55.680]   But they're killing the Apple app, too, the Apple Watch app.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:56.680]   True.
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.520]   If you're using an Apple Watch, you'll no longer be able to adjust your thermostat or change
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:02.080]   the Home Away mode from your watch.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:06.120]   However, the actions you were able to take on your watch are all available in the Nest
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.680]   app on your phone.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.320]   So just pull out your phone.
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:14.560]   You will continue to get notifications on your watch with the Nest app.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560]   Do that.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.200]   Cole, would you get to do anything about it?
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:19.040]   Yes, sorry.
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:22.000]   And that's your Google change law.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.760]   The population of the 1,6, and it.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:26.760]   Well, I like that.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760]   Yeah, I like that too.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:28.760]   That's good.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.760]   Is that my computer?
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:31.760]   I have no idea how that happens.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:32.760]   Oh.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.000]   We're getting the alarm strong.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.400]   I'm getting credit.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.040]   A little audio chatter from the moon.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:42.120]   Man, I, oh, it is mine.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.120]   It is mine.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.960]   I wish I wish I don't know.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:51.520]   I wish we'd stayed on the moon.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:53.240]   Okay.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:57.640]   I think we can we can wrap it up with your picks of the week because Jeff poor Jeff.
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.640]   What time is it now?
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.640]   Yeah, it is 12.23.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.640]   Oh, man.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:04.520]   And you have to get up in the morning.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:07.240]   And then Friday morning, I have a 6am flight.
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.960]   Let's get this over with.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:16.840]   First, very important word from our sponsor Express VPN, the number one VPN solution.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.080]   I think everybody listening to show knows you want a virtual private network for a couple
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.080]   of reasons.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.240]   One, for security when you're in an open Wi-Fi access point like Jeff is in Madrid.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:30.400]   You don't know what those hackers in Spain are up to with VPN.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:31.400]   You're protected.
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.160]   You'll your traffic is encrypted and doesn't enter the public internet until you get to
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.600]   express VPN servers.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.520]   By the way, they have one near you in Spain.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.840]   Jeff, in fact, they have them all over the world.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.200]   That's another reason Express VPN is awesome.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.920]   You can emerge into the world in any country you want.
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:51.600]   So geographic restrictions are a thing in the past.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.120]   No more internet with borders.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.600]   It also is great for protecting your privacy.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.880]   We know that internet service providers and mobile phone carriers track what you're doing
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:05.160]   online and even sell that information to marketers.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:06.680]   Express VPN blocks them out.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.840]   They can't see what you're doing online.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:14.240]   Now I have to say when you're choosing a VPN, you got to think about this because you're
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:18.840]   really just kicking the can down the road no longer can the ISP see what you're doing.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.280]   But the VPN provider can.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.520]   So choose a VPN provider who protects your privacy, protects your security.
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:25.960]   And that's Express VPN.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.320]   A third party audit was completed yesterday.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:31.840]   I was very pleased to see this on Express VPN.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:35.440]   And they said everything they say in their privacy policy is absolutely true.
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.320]   They do not log your contacts.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.920]   They do not log what you're doing.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.960]   They know nothing about what you're doing.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.800]   And Express VPN's new cutting edge server technology.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.160]   They call it trusted server.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:50.080]   This audit said does exactly what they say it does.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.960]   Trusted server prevents the operating system and apps from writing to the hard drive.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:56.320]   It sandboxes your VPN traffic.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:59.480]   It's a whole new standard of privacy and security.
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:03.000]   No one knows what you're up to including Express VPN.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.800]   It's time to stop hackers, stop big brother and stop internet companies from grabbing your
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:10.840]   data, tank pack, your online privacy and security.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:15.960]   It's what I use Express VPN dot com slash twig.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:20.400]   And by the way, not only is it the best secure as VPN, it's also the fastest because they've
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:24.840]   got so many servers, they really work hard to make sure that there's no penalty to use
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.480]   Express VPN that you're on the internet the same way you would be without it.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.080]   This one button click apps for every platform.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:36.480]   So it's very easy to start and stop the VPN service and at less than $7 a month.
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.480]   It's very affordable.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.480]   Now you're going to say, I know you do.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.480]   I hear it.
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:41.920]   But Leo, I know about XYZ VPN.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:42.920]   It's cheap.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:43.920]   It's free.
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.880]   Well, believe me, it costs the money to run that VPN.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.360]   It's free because they're doing something like injecting ads, selling your information.
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:55.200]   No good VPN service is going to be free.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.600]   Express VPN is a very fair $7 a month and it has a 30 day money back guarantee.
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.520]   It's actually less than seven.
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:05.560]   Look if you get the one year package, you'll get three extra months free and that makes
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:08.920]   it even more affordable Express VPN dot com slash twig.
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:14.200]   You got to use that address Express VPN dot com slash twig three extra months free with
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.240]   a one year package.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.000]   Now I've been saying this for months.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.400]   I've been saying it for years.
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:23.400]   Express VPN is the most private does not log.
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.880]   With the privacy policy, you can see they are absolutely pure as a driven snow.
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:36.160]   And now we know thanks to an independent audit from a PWC that Express VPN number one on tech
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.840]   radar is also completely secure and private.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.400]   I love that Express VPN.
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:42.400]   You don't have to trust me.
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.280]   You don't have to trust anybody.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.840]   You can believe it.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:46.840]   It's it's right there.
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:54.200]   You see his report Express VPN dot com slash twig.
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:45:01.280]   Here's the article on tech tech radar pro Express VPN latest VPN provider to get audited.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:05.720]   And by the way, this is this is a tech radar who does rate Express VPN their number one
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.720]   provider.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:08.320]   So that's awesome.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.400]   Really awesome.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:15.800]   Thank you everybody for listening to the show today for using Express VPN and all of
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:21.480]   our sponsors before we go though, we've got to get Kevin's stuff.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:24.520]   His pick of the week, Mr. Tofel.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:28.720]   So yeah, I'm going along with my community college theme.
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:35.920]   I mentioned I'm doing abstract data structures and all my programming.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:40.720]   Found an open source ID that we use.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:47.560]   And it's actually very functional, not the kind of function where you would create a
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.200]   like a big application.
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.680]   But for learning, it's actually fantastic because of the debugger and it's open source,
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.480]   which kind of fits in with a lot of the themes we talked about.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.800]   It's called J grasp.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:02.440]   It's made by the University of Auburn University.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.440]   Huh?
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:05.440]   But this is based on Eclipse.
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.640]   The ID is in is Eclipse.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:12.280]   No, this is built in Java.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.280]   Oh, interesting.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:17.480]   And it runs on the Java virtual machine and you can use it to program just about anything.
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:22.200]   But the viewer where you can like, I'm looking with a plug in for Eclipse, but they have
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:24.160]   their own ID as well.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.160]   Exactly.
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160]   Okay.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:31.120]   I mean, it's just amazing to look inside a data structure, for example, such as an array
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:33.080]   and see what's in each thing.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.320]   And as you run each line of code, the visuals actually change in the debugger to show you
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.320]   what's happening.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.800]   It's phenomenal for learning.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:44.560]   And again, open source, fantastic.
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:45.560]   Very cool.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.200]   And free J grasp JGRSP dot org.
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.200]   Nice.
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:54.200]   Wow.
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:55.200]   I'm not familiar with this.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.200]   I'll have to give it a try.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:57.200]   Very cool.
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.560]   Jeff, I know one number.
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:00.560]   Midnight.
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.840]   But six AM, but let's have another number from Jeff Jarvis.
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:14.440]   Real quickly, giant GDPR finds for breaches we knew about British Airways, 230 million
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:16.440]   area, 123 million.
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.440]   Good.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.440]   Yay.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440]   Or gas compromised.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:28.440]   To some extent, yes, careless does to some extent file under crap happens to some extent
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.520]   file under what it does happen.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.520]   Do the right thing.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.520]   Right.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:39.120]   Now, this is this is a big part of GDPR that I that I'm 100% behind, which is mandated.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:44.040]   If it was a breach, you're mandated to report it.
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.680]   And I think this is this is great.
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:48.880]   I presume that's the fine is that they didn't report it.
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:56.400]   And the maximum level of global turnover, those five to 1.5 percent of VA in very enter.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.400]   That's significant.
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.400]   Very significant.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.400]   Wow.
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:00.600]   That's very significant.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.600]   Holy cow.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.840]   Marriott, that breach went on for four years.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:07.840]   Yes.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.840]   It's particularly egregious.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.840]   Oh, good.
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:17.200]   I'm glad that that's I think that there's sometimes when you know you got you got to
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:20.400]   spank them before they do the right thing.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.000]   That's my motto.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000]   Jeff Jarvis, go to bed.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000]   You poor guy.
