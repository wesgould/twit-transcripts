[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:46.580]   Restaurant in the me all of Mexico City. I heard I heard I was listening to those week to have to have mole that has been cooking for
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.700]   2,570 days
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.500]   You could take the girl out of Texas, but you can't take the mole out of the meatloaf
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.380]   It's Stacy Higginbotham. I don't know what that means wait what?
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:14.940]   Try to alliterate sometimes I spit but it doesn't come out right
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.500]   The mole out of the mama out of the mama. There you go. There you go. What is mola Stacy you tell us oh
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.340]   My gosh, it's a blend of custom spices usually some peanut maybe some chocolate all kinds of stuff ground up
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.140]   Served over chickens the core ingredient is chocolate chocolate chocolate
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.180]   Chocolate baby. Yeah, yeah, I guess really it just means it just means sauce, but I think you're right
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180]   I don't think it has to have chocolate but typically
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.180]   It's yeah chocolate peanuts as as tick
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.580]   Delicacy I think a chocolate was very common of course anyway, they have he's gonna have
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.140]   I'm so jealous a tasting menu with both they call it mama's mola the
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.460]   2,750 year day old mole and in a novo mole so that he can compare
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.100]   So jealous
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.700]   That's Jeff Jarvis over there on my left is the letter to two professor for journalistic innovation at the
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   Craig
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:25.380]   Graduate school of journalism at the city University of New York hello everybody hello hello hello to see you all
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.020]   I feel like it's been a long time since we've all been in the same room together has hasn't it?
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.240]   I failed on you for like two weeks. So yeah, it's your fault. Did you go on vacation? Do something fun? I hope anyway?
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.540]   Yes, once was a migraine day once was a vacation as well. It was like an appointment date, but it was a fun appointment
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.100]   I hope you had fun. I went to an escape room. Oh, did you really? No? Yeah, how did you like it?
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.260]   It was my first time. I loved it. It was a really great experience. I went with
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.700]   My daughter her best friend and then my best friend was able to come in fun. We
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:05.220]   Had a 25% success rate and we failed on the last clue so we did not escape
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.620]   It's very disappointing. So what was the scenario of your escape room?
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:18.260]   ours was called the experiment and it was some guy working with sound waves and
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.900]   We had to like do a lot of cool stuff with sound and
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.260]   Patterns we did a really fun. I think we kind of intended as a team building
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.860]   Exercise escapement San Francisco
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:42.740]   So it was a did you go John? No, it was a bunch of people from work and the scenario was there had different ones that
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.980]   There was gonna be a nuclear meltdown and we had to get to the cores and pull the scram the cores before the meltdown
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.940]   And there's a timer and stuff and it's fun because there's puzzles physical puzzles
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.100]   It was really challenging and
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.340]   We you know what the thing blew up three seconds before we got to it
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.220]   Oh
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.700]   But you had they had they had this this the couple that did this was very geeky
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.300]   So they had VR helmets and draw you had a pilot a drone. There was also a really geeky stuff. It was really really
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.820]   Fun. I can't remember the name of it and I really wonder if they're still there because I have to have a feeling this is a
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.700]   difficult business to survive
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.060]   Oh, that reminds me the VR
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.220]   fired it up again yesterday from a niece and
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.500]   Facebook is not
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:46.740]   Necessarily required it still works without a facebook account. Oh how alluya? Yeah, you just can't get some of the although there's social aspects
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.300]   I
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.940]   Ironically they have pulled the Oculus Quest 2 because I saw that people are getting big raccoon eyes
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.420]   From the mask apparently they're allergic. So they've actually pulled it off the market. I also read a story
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.260]   Maybe it's a little overhyped that there are people whose facebook's account have been hacked and of course
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.140]   It's almost impossible to get anybody at facebook to respond to this. You know, they have a you know
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.940]   I've lost to control my account. There's this whole process, but I get calls all the time the reissue
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.780]   I can't get in I can't get in I've been trying for weeks and months so at least one person went out bought an Oculus Quest
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.060]   then complained
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.700]   Got a fixed and returned to quest. Oh, so that's one solution
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.340]   $300 device to get a facebook's attention
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.380]   Wow, yeah, I would love a quest, but I
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:44.820]   I don't gonna count on this loophole forever. They they said they want you to have a facebook account. So that was it for me
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.660]   Yeah, it works is just some of you have one
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.780]   Yeah, the some of this stuff no I had that rift
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.860]   And she gave me but this still works with just yeah the regular games that are local to know they're fun
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.980]   Yeah, they're fun. That's all I care about. Yeah
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:09.140]   Do you play beat saber? That's that's the one the michael likes. It's really fun very active berg says he's one of the people who gets
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.500]   Oculus Quest raccoon eyes
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:18.340]   He reacts to the do they have what do they have is it nickel is a foam? I don't know it's um
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.060]   I can't I doubt they put nickel in the foam, but you never know right never know
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.180]   You never know that's a that's a common allergy that people would have with like smart watches, but
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.580]   Well, what's the rubber gloves stuff for people gonna larger too latex latex?
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:38.820]   Maybe they have a latex in it. That'd be more more likely so you won't need a facebook account for that rift you have
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.980]   uh, but
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.660]   Supposedly the Oculus 2 does so west 2 does so I don't know
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.700]   I wouldn't count on it not needing an account
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.300]   All right, we are doing all of this because we really are we dragging our feet
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.740]   K we're going kicking and streaming you don't have to do it. You're the boss. It's not an democracy
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.100]   You're the you're the dictator. You don't have to do it. Just don't do it. It's okay
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.260]   There is a story this week that we have dealt with on every show
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.700]   And we're finally rounding it out here. I'm so sick of it
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:17.540]   I mean we said look everything that need to be said stacey. You was great by the way
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.540]   Thank you for joining us sunday on twit. It was really nice to have you so waffly
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.220]   Just like this is so new waffles
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.580]   Oh, that's true. No, you were good. You are really really waffle green
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.300]   Um, but we were talking about of course apples
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.340]   Uh, what ben tomsen calls apples mistake
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.540]   in stratecary. I think ben kind of said it and
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.980]   This was the this was to me exactly my problem
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.180]   apple announced new protections against child pornography c sam detection
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:55.140]   They announced and they that everybody agrees they announced it poorly because they conflated three different completely different technologies
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.100]   As everybody assumed they're just kind of one thing
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.500]   One of the technologies scans photos on iCloud photo storage
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.740]   Using the database from the national center for missing and exploited children
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.580]   They have and they are a government founded and funded
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.420]   But not a government organization, but they have a database of images child pornography images
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.740]   Which they've created a perceptual hash
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:25.940]   With using computers the idea of a perceptual hash is even if the pictures modified made black and white or cropped
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.340]   It should still show up. They measure at distances in the picture and things like that
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:36.020]   Uh, and this percept they have a database of hashes just numbers fingerprints of these images
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:42.980]   Which apple and others use by the way google's been doing it on google drive google also does it in gmail attachments
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.460]   Facebook's not a four years
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:51.220]   Uh dropbox most cloud providers do it actually which is they scan the images you store on the cloud
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.780]   Uh most most of the time
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.900]   I believe during ingress and uh, you know so that
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:02.180]   They can be encrypted at rest, but as you're uploading them. They're not encrypted yet. They scan them on the way in
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.460]   Uh, just to what they do is they run the similar perceptual hash technology this came from microsoft
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.580]   They put it in the public domain or they gave it away to nikmik
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.180]   Years ago
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.660]   To against these images to see if there's a match
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.580]   Apple says one match won't do it. We want to avoid false positives
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.620]   So there's a threshold you have to have a certain number which they won't say of matches
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.860]   If we see that many matches will then report will suspend your account report you to the to national center for
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.740]   Missing exploited child action. There's one step in between they will upload a copy of the image
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:39.700]   To a human at apple who will look at it verify that it is in fact child pornography and then
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:46.500]   So somebody will see that image. Well, they want to they're at all costs of white false. I know. Yes, exactly
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.140]   They want to at all costs avoid false positives. They don't want to accuse somebody
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:57.060]   Emp and incorrectly say say doing this we will have a one in a trillion chance of false positives
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.860]   Which is a completely made up number. How would you know? You don't know
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.700]   But let's assume they've done a good job of that spen says this is a good system apple kind of needed to do it
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.700]   We were talking before the show
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:14.740]   I don't want to steal a number from you jeff but facebook has been doing this last year in 2020. They reported 20.5 million
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:20.500]   Images child pornography images apple reported 265
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.220]   So apple has been avoiding it's there's certainly there
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:33.140]   They've just been closing their eyes to it and we suspect we all surmised that apple has probably been under a lot of pressure to do something about this
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.100]   So that's one thing they're doing
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.140]   Another thing they're doing which is I think problematic and ben says
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.260]   This is the mistake
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.900]   They are also putting this neck neck neck database on your phone
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:55.300]   This will come with iOS 15 and I phone an ipad anything with ipad or iOS on it
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.780]   And will then compare images on your device
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.580]   To compare the hashes and with a similar result that
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:11.060]   Is really upsetting to people they don't like the idea of apple scanning their phones something that you own
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.820]   Uh for any reason at all. There's a third
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:20.260]   Have a kitten a minute. Yeah, I just want to give you the lay of the land we've all heard this but i'm trying to do it fast
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.980]   The third thing is something for kids
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:32.260]   Uh images being sent to or sent by kids will be scanned and that's completely separate way unrelated to the neck neck database or perceptual hashes
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:38.580]   Will be scanned by some technique apple hasn't really specifically described for being
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.060]   uh pornographic
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:41.940]   and
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:47.860]   Not necessarily child pornography but pornographic and then the kid will be warned and say you don't want to see this
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:53.220]   If and then if the kids is no, I want to see it and I said what you look you really don't want to see this if you see this
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.980]   We're gonna have to tell your parents and if the kid says I don't care it will then tell their parents and the parents have to turn this on
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:04.420]   I don't really have a problem with that. But I I think that the fundamental issue Ben does have is
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.220]   None of this stuff should be happening on your phone
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:13.940]   Uh, this isn't this is an apples to to do and what the eff cdt math
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:19.700]   You green many others have said there's a petition going around with last time I checked 7 000 signatures
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.060]   I'm sure it's more than that from some of the most prestigious cryptographers and internet thinkers
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.420]   Says this is a slippery slope apple if you do this for child pornography
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:36.740]   You've effectively announced that you have this technology you will be put under intense pressure to do the same kind of thing
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.580]   For homosexual images in countries where it's illegal to be gay
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:48.100]   For uh, they worry some some are worried about trans kids who are in transition sending pictures and getting busted
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.980]   uh and and beat by their parents things like that so uh
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:57.220]   That's the in a nutshell if I I hope I've said that accurately
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.460]   Um, that's a good explanation. That's basically what's going on and people also
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.260]   I'll do a devil's advocate here playing
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.140]   pretty my leo hat on
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.380]   um
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.380]   two things one is
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.180]   Either we mean it or we don't
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.900]   that we want to stamp out all possibilities of
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.780]   uh child porn and
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.820]   um
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:26.100]   If we do then we've got to acknowledge that priority and if we don't really mean it in it's only in certain places
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.260]   Then do we really mean it?
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260]   second point is um
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:37.780]   The line between you know as as as as google announces tensor coming onto our phones
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:43.940]   The line between oh, it's in the cloud or it's on their server. It's on our phone becomes more and more meaningless
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.500]   and and the back and forth of where things are and where they're
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:55.860]   Analyzed for whatever reason is going to become more and more meaningless. So you could see a point where
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.700]   um
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:05.140]   Fine. I don't have to put any of my child porn photos up on the cloud. I can have tons of them on the device that apple provides
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:11.700]   and uh apple has the mechanism to find it out and do something about it and do we as a society
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.220]   What's our priority here the worry about the slippery slope which lord knows I always agree with and always worry about
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.980]   But it's a classic case as I think stacey would say we need to discuss this because um
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.900]   uh
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.300]   There's two priorities here in conflict
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:33.860]   And and I think that there is an argument that says if we mean it about child porn then we mean it about child porn
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.260]   It shouldn't be anywhere and uh that we're all going to a seed to this
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.980]   Anybody want to respond or shall I?
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.540]   Jeff did a great job with
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.980]   Saying what I would say so good job jeff you're great
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.700]   Uh oh
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.780]   I'm a little concerned because you were playing devil's advocate but we shall
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.020]   We should of course establish that nobody here is arguing favorite child porn
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.140]   Exactly. Everybody agrees those this is reprehensible at all
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.340]   Just how much do you mean it?
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.140]   Yeah, yeah
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.100]   Well
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.260]   But this is my problem with what you said you can say that about a lot of things
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.020]   uh
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.780]   The question is how far are you willing to go?
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:20.100]   Should I put a camera in your house to make sure that you're not looking at child porn in your private collection?
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.780]   That would work
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.380]   Should I go that far how far do I have questions how far do we want to go?
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.820]   And that's why
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.820]   In the united states in the constitution
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.740]   There is an amendment to prevent unreasonable search and seizure that there is a it is
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:40.100]   It is presumed I think by that fourth amendment that yeah, you could eliminate all a crime
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.780]   if you were willing to keep station police in every house
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.700]   But we don't do that that there that we have a
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.420]   Constitutional limit said on how far we'll go to stop all crime
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:59.300]   But we're about to have that world and that's why we need to have these discussions because when we have cameras everywhere
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:04.420]   It is completely possible to say to someone hey, you know what you've been convicted. Uh, you're you're
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.060]   What do they call them?
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.060]   You have a history of sexualist or
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:15.380]   Uh, you're a predator predator register. There you go. You're a sex offender. Yeah. Thank you. No, sorry
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.940]   So we we might be able in the future
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.620]   We could do it today actually say hey, you know what you're registered sex
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.980]   That would be we're gonna need you to put this camera right here if you want access
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:31.060]   But we already do things like take computer access and broadband access away from people who commit computer crimes
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.460]   But we don't go in their house and and watch them
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.500]   Well, we don't today
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:44.660]   It's possible that you could use things like so is your the question is is apples cloud your house
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.420]   No, is your phone your house
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.380]   Well, that's actually
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:57.060]   We've had like if you look at the way we're treating phones at the border. It's not your house
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.340]   Uh, if you think it's a problem for that too, by the way
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:06.100]   Well, yeah, and that's why we need to talk about this because what they what the courts have done is suspend the fourth amendment
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.180]   Uh in border crossings. They say it doesn't hold right you're not protected. So
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.980]   We need to have this conversation because we need to build new laws to
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.980]   Meet us where we're at with the type of technology we have
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:24.980]   And so, you know, that's right. I think the constitution. Here's the thing. I think the constitution
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.500]   Is actually really good on this and that you really
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:34.100]   Shouldn't have there is such a thing as unreasonable search and seizure and the courts have been very good at saying
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:41.140]   There's the line now. I agree stacy there. I don't have any pro I have no problem with cloud storage
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.380]   That's my stuff on their computer
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:49.300]   Uh, I have every people who bring their computers into best buy we've actually said
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.940]   Hey, if you bring your computer with child porn on it into best buy and best buy technicians find your child porn
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.100]   They they have a duty to report
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.300]   They don't have a choice. They have a duty to report and that's fine
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.820]   I don't have a problem with that. I have a problem with us snooping in people's private homes
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.060]   But I think you raised a really interesting question
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.860]   Somewhere in between their cloud and my home is this thing this the smartphone
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.020]   What is that?
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:18.100]   And that's all right. You raise a really interesting question there stacy on floss weekly this morning dok seros and
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:24.500]   Sean powers and jonathan beneday were talking about this because yeah, it even made it to the open source show
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:30.900]   um, but the just the thought of who what exactly do you own as the computer?
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.460]   um, is if you own this phone what what are your right citizens and
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:41.140]   Can you just say hey? I own this phone? I don't need you snooping on and I notice this apple iphone
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:46.180]   But this is my phone you you don't have to write to snoop on my phone
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:51.140]   Versus going to say a facebook and putting your stuff on facebook servers
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.820]   And yeah facebook says you know what hey, we don't want this on our on our servers
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:00.180]   I think that is so exactly the conversation going on in this country right now. Yeah, what protection should the phone have
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.180]   We've had it before so watch out here comes a jeff moment in history
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.580]   Should we have a drum waiting for this?
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.500]   It's a moment in history history
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.300]   twirling thing
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   The medieval harps
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.420]   Yeah, so do we have to stay see they never left
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:26.180]   So i appear on the show i don't listen to it afterwards. Yeah, I never hear it either. That's why
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.900]   I shouldn't be held responsible. Okay. Go ahead. That's right
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.220]   So in my fun in my fun moments and boy, I'm a fun guy. I am reading
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:39.940]   Or just read the history and present condition of newspaper and periodical press the United States from the 1880 census
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.260]   and uh in 1835
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:50.260]   The postmaster general was dealing with the case where the southern states
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:56.340]   Said that state laws restricted the circulation of incendiary newspapers
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:05.140]   Guess what they were incendiary about abolitionist newspapers and we're requiring the u.s postal service to
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.020]   um find out what was in that mail
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:13.540]   Papers but other things as well and prevent its circulation into those states. Wow
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.420]   So that as president jackson said
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:22.580]   Uh, I must invite your attention to the painful excitement produced in the south by attempts to circulate through the males
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:30.820]   Lamentory appeals addressed to the passions of the slaves in print and in various publications calculated to stimulate them to
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.620]   Insurrection and to produce the all the horrors of a servile war
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.260]   So boy and it was a real winner real piece of work
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.380]   And then and then there's i'm now reading this book
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.100]   Uh, which is really really goes amazing the man who hated woman about andrew cobstock
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:56.660]   The guy who was at the postal service who tried to get rid of pornography and abortion and and women's rates and free love and all this other stuff
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:02.660]   So the the postal service, right was that same kind of analog here to your phone? Well, it's not
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.940]   I was under the impression. They can't do that. Can they can they?
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.540]   Well since then
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.700]   Since then your first amit first. Well your first class male
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:17.140]   Is sacrosanct except against a warrant? This is an argument I made many times in the show
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.380]   But I have older people and that's by the way
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.300]   How your house is protected as well?
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:26.500]   Because if well if there's reasonable cause a judge can issue a warrant and please can come in and look for child born
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:34.740]   But this is the problem with why the the right was written to the technology of the us male first class rather than to the concept
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:42.900]   Of private messaging. This is why your dms and your emails are not protected like your first class us male is
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:49.540]   Because it was written to the technology and it's being enforced to the specific of well your us male first class protected
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.820]   But nothing else is now in the males itself
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:58.180]   Postcards as we said a couple weeks ago are not protected because they can't be seen
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:04.340]   Uh, and if cliff clavin sees you have child born your postcard. Well, then cliff fast turn you in
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.460]   um and
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.220]   Neither newspapers to at the time, right? They were just they were just being carried
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.820]   um
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:19.140]   And in fact there was there was a time when newspapers were delivered free by the postal service within the same county within 30 miles
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:24.900]   Uh as a subsidy to newspapers, right? So so there was a question there about well, what's a newspaper or not?
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.340]   What's incendiary or not what's subversive or not?
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.740]   And isn't that echoing
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.420]   What we have today in all of these discussions whether it's political
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:40.020]   insurrection as it was then or whether it's pornography in the form of advocating
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.980]   abortion, um
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.580]   Let me read the homosexuality or let me read the fourth amendment because I think it's very clear
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.500]   This is this is in the constitution the right of the people to be secure in their persons
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.660]   houses
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.660]   papers and effects
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:03.060]   Persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:10.260]   searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probabble probable cause
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:15.140]   It's very recent in legal history that that came to become the doctor
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.340]   I understand but but it is our constitution. It is it is the holy
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:27.620]   You know, it wasn't interpreted this way. It's fairly recent. I understand but I agree with your interpretation your house has papers and effects
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:35.220]   Means my person things on my person, but I think a phone could very reasonably qualify as effects
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:41.300]   Uh, and I think so your papers are your your papers have to be in that interpretation
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.820]   Do your papers have to be in your possession or if there are your papers?
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.500]   No, no, I think and they're seen somewhere else. I think this implies the males
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.780]   I think it applies in your personal space. You know your person
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.420]   Has your car that was the other issue?
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:25:00.500]   Why sending documents and pornography over the cloud become a problem or sending them off of your device
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.060]   And how would they get on your device without transmitting through like the internet is
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:10.900]   Well, I could put no, no, I can I could take a picture and put it. It's on my device. It hasn't gone through the internet
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.940]   Okay. Well, that's true. So and and by the way, you affirmed this
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.700]   Apple says all you have to do to disable this
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:26.500]   Is to turn off iCloud photo storage, which is an option. So apple says not our problem
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.460]   Yeah, if you turn off iCloud photo storage
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:34.900]   Uh, the database will be on your phone because it's going to be on every phone, but it won't we won't be doing any scanning
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.540]   So I think
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.620]   That's maybe apple's way of saying you don't have to do this. You don't have to put up with this
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.820]   But I I think the fore look
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.180]   The constitution seems very clear and I think we should honor it and I think your
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:54.980]   Your phone counts as either papers or effects are both it's your stuff
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.060]   And it should be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. So
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.260]   So I just looked up probably I'll get again
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.140]   As I used the words child pouring the search
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.140]   Uh USPS and same look at the chilling effect by the way
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.540]   Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.380]   They're watching
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.900]   Well, okay
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.340]   I think the chilling effect is my god. What if you actually pull up child porn?
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.300]   Not for me. I don't think jeff's worry is that the feds are coming after him
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.060]   I think jeff's legit worries. He might see something he cannot see in this situation
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.540]   Well, and if I do see it if I do see it, I have a legal responsibility to report it
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.020]   And if I don't report it in the right way, I have liability at the union. I can up a jail
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.940]   Yeah, the law
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:41.940]   This is this is part of the discussion is we're moving lines. No no governor quilmo the line for you didn't move you just didn't know it
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.220]   But we are moving lines in terms of
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:51.460]   Of our our I have to um, he's screwed over my school. So to help with you governor
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.020]   Uh soon to be ex governor
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.220]   Um
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.340]   And so we're having us as against Stacy would say we're having this discussion
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.660]   So what is the discussion? We're we are intolerant and properly so of child porn
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:09.300]   We are intolerant of insurrection. We're intolerant of other things. All right. What is the protection of
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.820]   Society against those things. How far are we willing to go as a society?
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:23.540]   And when we say to facebook or twitter or google or apple, you must get rid of this long relist of things
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:29.220]   Okay, well, why does it stop at them then the usps says that they investigate things
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.580]   Most things now involve both the us mail and the internet
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.620]   So the postal service is involved in in this
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.820]   Do we say that's the right thing because we we all in fact do hate child porn and want to stamp it out
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.180]   Or where is there a limit here? That's a discussion to be had
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.980]   and as we as we
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.780]   Put other things on the list of intolerance
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.100]   As I would agree with pretty things on that list
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:56.660]   Then we've got to decide in each case how far we're willing to go
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.740]   Are we going to require?
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:02.820]   Facebook and twitter and google like germany does to take down certain things or else their ass is brass
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:09.060]   Or are we going to say that that's their right to do and when they take down rann paul off youtube
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:16.900]   Um, and I got people after me on twitter today say well, it's google sensory. Oh my god. Well, that's cool. It's right
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.540]   Yes, google's right. So
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:26.340]   This is the discussion we're having at level where where what what is your personal effect is changing right?
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.900]   Yeah, but I think
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.420]   But this is directly an answer to your hypothetical
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.780]   Yes, we're against child pornography. We're against a lot of things
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:40.100]   But there is a clear bright line about how far we go
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:45.380]   We could do a better job of law enforcement across the board
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:53.860]   But we aren't willing to violate the fourth amendment. That's why the fourth amendment is there because they didn't want the british coming into their houses
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:59.460]   I mean it was a very real concern for for the framers. So
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:05.780]   I think it's pretty darn clear and so was there anything different in this discussion than the last 10 you've had on this
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.860]   Not yeah, actually there was it is. Yeah, you're the first one's ever argued that we should
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.820]   We should do doubles advocate. Yeah
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:18.100]   Yeah, um, I mean just I think I really again. I just want to say I think Ben nailed it
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:22.660]   Starts the cloud. That's fine. That's your cloud. You don't have to put up with that
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.620]   But stay off my personal effects
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.980]   And that's the phone. Let me give you one more hypothetical
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.940]   What if we have uh, so discourse is um federated, right?
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.780]   Discord
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.420]   Discord is federated. Yes. Yeah, right
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:44.420]   Uh, maybe this is a bad example. Is it federated? No, I think the company runs all the servers. It's not technically federated
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:50.100]   All right. So let's imagine you could say you could say mastodon which is we have a mastodon instance that twitt us social
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.980]   That is federated. I run my server many other servers out there including by the way adult servers
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.700]   Do you run do you end up trafficking anything from any other servers other than your own?
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.020]   You do unless you block it
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:08.740]   So right so let's just say you don't block it. Let's just say right. Yeah, and so you're part of a federation where stuff's moving through your servers
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:14.420]   By default there are a list of servers now. I have to say when you install it there is a canonical list of servers
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.460]   You can review and the people who run it
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.540]   Uh
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:23.140]   Don't put child porn servers on there so you could conceive of somebody
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.860]   Setting up a child porn server, but you're let's say somebody gets somebody does it surreptitiously
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.940]   Yeah, it gets through it is on your server that is sitting in your living room, right
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:37.140]   You didn't do it, but it's there in your house
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.820]   What say you sir?
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:46.260]   Where's the line there in a federated world? I'm talking about the with the architecture changes
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.860]   How do we deal with those those new situations?
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:57.380]   Um, that's it. I mean, I don't I don't think you should be held culpable for it
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.980]   if
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:04.580]   It's reasonable that you had no idea if you took an affirmative step of some kind to
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:10.500]   To host it then clearly you're culpable. But well, let's go the next step. What if what if there is
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:19.780]   A presumption that the there there there's easy. What's it called? Mcnic? Nick nic nic mic nic nic mec
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.500]   nic, um
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.860]   National Center for Child and for missing and exploited children, right? So there's an easy way in your technical
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:33.940]   Technologically, that's the thing there is an easy way to do it. You should take didn't for a long time and now does
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:39.300]   So that's that's a perfectly so should everybody who has any host does that. I'm asking
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.180]   Should they be responsible? Should they care? Yeah, should they be required? Is that is that our hash?
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.340]   Is that a lot? That's an interesting question. But yeah, I think it's reasonable to say that
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:54.820]   Um, I I wouldn't particularly want to do it, but you're right. I'm hosting if I'm hosting material other people put there
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.300]   And I don't make an effort to
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:02.420]   Check it. I should have some sort of system to check it. Yes. Hello section 232, right?
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.620]   It's it's it's it's it goes to intermediate reliability too
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.340]   And so it raises all of these interesting questions and and I think we have to have
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:16.340]   So facebook's a good example discussions. They're liable for any bit of child pornography. That's on their service, right?
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.220]   That's they are liable. They are they are they are expected to go hunting for it and they do
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:26.500]   And they do but they also it's tolerated if they miss something they it's understood. They're doing their best, right?
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:32.020]   Yes, I think in their case stuff and I think that's maybe what apple is starting to feel the heat about is
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.460]   Are you really doing your best if you only found 265 examples?
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.180]   Bingo
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.420]   And I obviously apple decided
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:46.740]   Whether proactively or in response to heat that they ought to do something about this and I I commend them on that
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:51.780]   Fine. I don't have any problem with them scanning the they're they're uh, I cloud
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.660]   Do we all agree? That's fine
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.300]   Anybody disagree now. Yeah
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.580]   Does anybody disagree now you I know you were being
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:06.580]   devil's advocate but but in reality does anybody disagree that searching the phone is a step too far?
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.180]   I don't know
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:17.300]   I feel like that's something we have to come to as a group. Um, the way they're searching the phone
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.260]   feels like a good
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:25.700]   Option if we really are serious about preventing child child porn, right?
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.580]   And the technology has been proven to be so good
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:35.780]   In the hashing I've never heard complaints that the hashing got the false positives. Well, okay now
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.580]   I will bring in that's interesting testimony
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:43.460]   from somebody who does perceptual hashing who uh,
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.260]   actually thinks that
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.340]   apple is overstating
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:53.140]   Its capabilities. Uh, this is from renoffounder.com
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.820]   Uh, this guy, uh, does forensic
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:03.300]   Pardon me. Who's that who is who is red a founder? It's all of her. He lives in birlin
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.940]   He
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:12.980]   Yeah, yeah, all right, but he does forensic perceptual hashing. So he actually knows a lot about the perceptual hashing technology
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:18.500]   He wrote a piece called the problem with perceptual hashes. I won't rehash the hash
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.340]   I'll let you uh, read it if you're interested, but
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:28.100]   He he says here's an example of a false positive. We find we're trying to find this image
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:33.540]   The algorithm finds this image and it's because the way the algorithm works
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:38.740]   He says in the context of a hundred million photos, which isn't that many they do fail quite often
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.540]   And they don't fail in acceptable ways
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:49.700]   So well, here's where we could get audits. So this is a really interesting one of the controls in using ai for things
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.860]   is going to have to be
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:52.900]   public
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.900]   audits of how well this works
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.700]   Right. So it's possible that we could say to apple. Hey, you know what?
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:02.820]   It's a big step. We're asking you know, you're asking us to take let's test it out. Let's give you
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:03.460]   Yeah, we'd like to
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:08.180]   The moment of research. I think that's completely we'd like to know more because apple's claiming this one in a trillion
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.340]   And as Oliver points out
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.100]   That's just a made-up number. There's no way you would have any idea of how
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.980]   Many false positives you had that's that's the issue. It's exactly what you said state
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:26.500]   Well, and if you do send it to people to check in the final version, that's a really good parameter. So I mean
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:33.380]   This guy may not be completely wrong, but he may be overstating his case as well
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.180]   So somewhere in the but if we had a way to test it
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:42.580]   Then, you know, we could we could actually come to this with the right information to say is this a good idea or not
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.860]   The same way we could have a conversation about hey should we let
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.980]   Algorithms determine if people get bail. Well, let's take a look at what happens when we do
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:55.140]   And also facial recognition I would say that if if someone can get
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.980]   Arrested and shot down because of bad facial recognition, then I agree with you
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.900]   We shouldn't allow it in that case, but if there are the checks to say this is just
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.180]   one
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:12.020]   Signal and there are proper checks in like warrants. Yeah, but I would evidence there's no warrant
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.260]   I would have that system. I would point out
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.780]   I mean, it's you're not going to go to jail, but let's say you're falsely there's a false positive in your flag
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.860]   Then it's sent to apple somebody unknown person at apple is now looking at your private pictures
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:29.780]   And it may say oh, you know, that's just Leo's pick. That's not child pornography. It's okay
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.660]   That's the animal abuse we found
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.620]   Yeah, but I'm just saying
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.500]   That's that you're not getting arrested
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:44.100]   But your pictures your personal pictures are being sent to an unnamed employee at apple for review
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:49.380]   Uh, if there's false positives and and you know, this is what Oliver says
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:57.300]   Does that apple have the manpower in place to iron out their shortcomings their algorithm short comings? We can only hope so
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.700]   perceptual hasters are messy
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:06.420]   The fact that an image the simple fact that image data is reduced to a small number of bits leads to collisions and therefore false positives
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:12.660]   When such algorithms are used to detect criminal activities, especially at an apple scale many innocent people
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:18.260]   Can potentially face serious problems and so that's a reasonable cause for concern
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:21.220]   I think stacey you nailed it apple needs to demonstrate
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:27.620]   This one in a trillion they need to they need to show us not just say look here's some hand waving
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.020]   We're gonna do it. You could trust us
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.660]   And I don't think it should be on my phone honestly
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.220]   and I think having the person involved is essential simply because
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.020]   every algorithm is going to
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.820]   Things are going to be not what we want. I don't know if y'all did the New York Times did a great thing about it
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:54.660]   Was there the bail algorithm that they talked about like building equity and justice into these and they showed the trade-offs that you end up making
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.140]   And I end up voting. We all hate that. I end up voting against that in california
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.580]   I was at first because I hate meant money bail. I think that's a bad solution
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.380]   But I was convinced by the end double a cp and others that you know the algorithm isn't better
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:14.820]   Yeah, so so if you look at that we've got to realize that the algorithm is not going to be perfect
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:20.420]   It's going to mess things up. But we need to know where it's going to mess things up and then we have to have
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.700]   steps in place to say okay
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:29.060]   Well, this this is how we will fix this just like facebook with their, you know didn't want to show
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:34.660]   Was it nipples so they wouldn't show breastfeeding moms, you know and someone had to get involved. Yeah. Yeah
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.940]   so
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.700]   The classic now is the is the uh, child
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:46.660]   napalm photo associated press from vietnam
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.420]   Right it ticked off every box naked child in danger
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:55.700]   And as we've discussed the show before and so it's not just the algorithm
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:39:01.860]   It's also then the human being and that is human beings that take it down and the human being made a decision that was journalistically
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.100]   insane
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.060]   Yeah
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:12.420]   Right you posted in the show know something that they were discussing on floss weekly this morning, which is mike mass nix article on tech turt
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:20.100]   Uh the end of ownership how big companies are trying to turn everyone into renters and this ties into that this dovetails into that because
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.540]   That's really the question post that but we did talk about yeah
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:28.580]   About that and if you put it link, I think that's mr. Jarvis is
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:36.820]   A question is do I rent this phone? Is it my phone? Does apple on this phone? You know apple probably would say you know
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:43.940]   You might think you own this phone, but we have the right to do this because in fact is it your McFlurry machine? Yeah, there's another one
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:49.540]   There's another one fat. It's really fascinating and this is what we talk about on this show and it's
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:54.340]   I don't think it's uh easily solved but and I suspect apple is going to go full speed ahead
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.740]   But it's good. They had the conversation or everybody's talking about this
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:05.460]   It's interesting. This is there are some privacy issues that only we talk about and and you know our circle
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:10.420]   And all which means all the people listen to our shows and there's some things that have really
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.420]   The the attention of everybody and I think this one did
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.220]   Am I wrong?
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.740]   No, it's it's a
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.500]   Incendier everyone has an iPhone
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:28.260]   And most people have a pretty visceral reaction to child porn and privacy. So this was a a wonderful confluence of events
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.220]   Well, and then jeff would point out
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.300]   That's why whenever
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:41.700]   Some kind of you know police agency wants to go a step further in surveilling you they always invoke women and children
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:46.500]   Because nobody's in favor. General panic moral panic. Yeah, it's the this is the
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.940]   epitome of moral panic
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.220]   Ooh Leo said it. Ooh
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.220]   At least I invoked you when I said it
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:04.820]   Nice try to hide behind me fella. Yeah, it's your moral panic. Yeah my moral panic
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.060]   Uh
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.980]   Let's say you know this week of time for a quick break and then let's talk about what sam sung
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:17.060]   Announce this morning. We also have a google changelog jeff Jarvis Stacy hagan bought them and pruit
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:22.180]   This is a good group. I feel like we're all is and we can talk
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:25.380]   You know about difficult topics
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:30.740]   Honestly and with with candor because we're amongst friends. Yep
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.020]   Actually, we've had good conversations on every show about this
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.580]   Um, I don't think we've come to a solution, but
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:42.340]   Wait till we get to the same here. There isn't a solution as it works. Yeah, that's right. Yeah
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:47.620]   There's just a series of trade-offs. We have to work from it boy. People hate that. Yeah, I know
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:55.220]   Uh actually and in this context chat rooms reminded me of cori doctor. I just love cori doctoros
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.860]   Yeah, um article canada has the worst internet ideas. They're about to pass a harmful content
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:08.340]   It's just awful. It's like they took the worst of the world. Yeah, put it in a law. Yeah
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:16.500]   A requirement to remove lawful but awful speech that is allowed in a Canadian law, but effectively now also banned under Canadian law
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.300]   24-hour deadlines for removal
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:25.060]   Uh a defacto requirement for platforms to install algorithmic filters
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:33.300]   to identify and misidentify and remove prohibited expression and huge penalties for failing to remove banned
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.620]   speech
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.140]   Plus no penalties for erroneously taking down permitted speech right
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:45.060]   Plus a Chinese style national firewall that will block websites that refuse to comply
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:52.500]   Oh boy. Holy moly. Oh boy. It is awful. Oh my goodness. Oh, Canada. What have you done? Oh
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.180]   Canada, uh, it is not yet law
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:01.300]   But um, but the politics would point toward it passing. Yeah
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:07.620]   Anyway, this is this is why this is why jeff
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.660]   gets nervous
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:16.420]   About well, why should we get rid of all the stuff? We should we must do this and then look how an extent look how
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:20.900]   No instant German hate speech law. Yeah, and right to be forgotten and
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:25.620]   Nett's dg and so on and so forth end up
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.420]   metastasizing
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:34.980]   in australia and canada and otherwise same countries forget the insane countries like turkey and
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.300]   hungry and china
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:43.780]   Uh, even in the same countries now. It did this this part meat moral panic. It's the point that people say well, something must be done
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:50.580]   So let's just do it. So you have a michlomer charas bad law. You have a lot of really bad 230 laws in the us
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.700]   That's what worries me. I'm not defending facebook or even google or twitter
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:04.260]   Defending the internet and the freedom as we have there does seem i'll back you up on this a knee jerk response to the threats that the internet poses
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.100]   That uh in almost every case or worse than the problem
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.260]   And this is clearly one on the presumption. I saw kevin roost went after
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.700]   um
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.940]   He's going to kill me the now ceo of uh instagram formerly
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:25.780]   Ahead of the newsfeed at facebook kevin's systram thank no no no no the current
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:30.740]   Oh, um, this is so embarrassing
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:34.020]   adam, sorry
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.900]   So adam, sorry said something that I say all the time just um
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:44.420]   Yes, the internet does has bad things but also has good things. He says I think the good always the bad and roost just goes after him
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.180]   Like how do you know that well kevin? How do you know that's not the case either? It's just a
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.300]   Statement of feeling uh that's an impossible data set to gather
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:57.300]   Uh, but the but the knee jerk responses someone defends the internet
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:02.980]   Uh here comes the journalist wow. I can't be truly I can I can answer kevin's
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:08.020]   Uh with a simple thought experiment would we be better off
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:12.260]   Today the way it is or if there were zero internet
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.180]   Right
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.740]   And a corollary that is which would be a better situation?
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:23.540]   Which is when you want to live in today's internet turned off internet right or and also if we turned off facebook completely today
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:28.980]   Would all of our problems of racism and hate and lies go away? No, but a lot of them would
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:34.660]   Well, maybe mark zuckerberg would go away. Oh no, I'm I had to disagree with you on that one
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.820]   I hate facebook as much as I hate facebook. It is nice to know that they're
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.460]   They've given voice
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:47.860]   To some people that don't necessarily have a voice and jeff said that of course the chief example of this is the
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.740]   Uh video that was posted
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:59.300]   Of george floyd getting a joy. Yes without that video. There would have been no conviction there would would have been just another day
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:06.580]   Yes, so you're right. I mean, maybe she would have posted on twitter or somewhere else, but that's where it was posted facebook
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:11.220]   Mm-hmm. So you were you were headed into an eyes commercial break. Yeah
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:13.860]   Then what happened? I thought
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:18.340]   I tried not to get too involved in this comment or this the section you want waffles
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:25.220]   I think i'm going to break. I just what I just I just I just want a little credit for having demolished kevin roose's argument
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.980]   Thank you. Yeah, did I not yes you did? Yes, you can just
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:33.940]   You're credit plus you now you've you've earned the money the sponsor is going to bring you
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.820]   Yes, oh don't think it goes to me
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:45.700]   Not to me talk about how to make some extra money. Yeah, actually actually this is a really
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:52.660]   You know I sit down as an old guy and lecture my kids and young people all the time
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:59.140]   It's something somebody told me and actually I was probably in my 30s before I heard this but they said
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:06.020]   Put money away every day for your retirement the magic of compound interest and I have to say looking back
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.100]   I thank god. I got that advice
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:14.180]   I was working somewhere where there was a this brand new thing called a 401k and I have ever since
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:20.260]   No matter how little I got paid put at least a small percentage of my income into a 401k and today
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.660]   I I have I can retire
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.700]   I was able to buy a house
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:30.900]   Uh, you know we could talk about diamond hands and stonk memes and rocket ships that is not gonna
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:36.740]   Do the job day trading is basically going to bus vegas
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.260]   There's winners, but there's also losers. It could be a lot of fun. I'm not saying that

[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:23.620]   I read a really great book. I highly recommended by the late david swenson
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:29.220]   He ran yells endowment for 30 years was hugely the most successful fund manager ever
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:33.060]   And in his book on conventional wisdom. He says, you know what?

[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:36.580]   wealth front

[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:53.060]   She's got issues, but boy our last one had issues
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:52:00.020]   Um, he he got us out. We we we rented can't say that word. By the way. No more. That's right. Yeah, that's right
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:05.780]   He he equaled us out of and that's a better one. Yeah, you can't notice you've been quil mode
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.500]   um
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:12.740]   I think it was $2.5 million to rebuild a floor that we went ahead and rented
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.460]   And I have to raise money to pay the rent on and it's not rebuilt
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.540]   You know, it's funny
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.460]   before covid
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:26.820]   Cuomo had a terrible reputation and then he was he was so front and center and and it's seemingly so in command and did a good job
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.860]   In it. I feel so used and so dirty
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.260]   They can I liked him for a little while. Yeah, everybody liked him. I thought this is how it should be
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:40.020]   But it was all yummy. Yeah, same thing but something about new york something about new
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.900]   All the best people come from the york
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:48.020]   But but the good ones moved to florida, right?
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.020]   um
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:53.860]   Um
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.540]   So samsung
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:59.540]   What stays oh no, I was going to throw a story out there, but let's talk about samson
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.820]   We'll do that quickly and then you could throw out your story since I said yes word
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:08.980]   Um the galaxy full i did everybody starts saying no worries. Why did we all become Canadian?
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:16.740]   I won't not remember. We did it's australian. Yes, australian. No worries, mate. No worries. No walking furries
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:23.460]   Mate, when did that when did we all become australian? By the way, we all did it really says it. It's better than time
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:31.220]   Late 1980s, you know what australians say when we start saying my bad is that from the states? I hate that
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:33.460]   My bad
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.460]   You mean you did something wrong
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:39.860]   That's not a good australian. That's colony. Yeah, no, I don't know. I can't yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:45.300]   Michael for the transportation cane on the brain. So, uh, look at the price
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.860]   Twice of the galaxy fold
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:55.620]   Galaxy z fold three now. I have a fold two which I paid $1,500 for it is now
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.700]   $1,700 and 99
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:07.300]   1799 buckaroos. Nope. That's beyond
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:16.260]   Never doing it mr. No, ru wins the lottery. He's still not gonna do it
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:21.620]   Mr. Pruitt is too smart to spend that much money on an m phone right mr
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.460]   That is correct sir
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.460]   Well, I like to think that anyway
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:31.060]   The the only critic I can give about this phone is the the digitizer tech that they put in there the way
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:34.820]   They split it up into two different digitizers to work with the fold
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:40.740]   Why you have a stylist and it can actually go across the stylist without any issues
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:46.740]   Across the screen with the stylist without any issues. That's as it. I've had a fold too. It's been
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:53.140]   I don't really like it. There is um, baseball has it. There's this guy
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:56.980]   a good looking guy
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:03.300]   he was Mario Mendoza second baseman for the uh, a short stop. I'm sorry
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.940]   for the Pittsburgh pyrates
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:12.900]   Who uh is batting average about 200 they he's been memorialized in baseball with the phrase the mandoza line
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.140]   If you're batting averages below 200 one and five hits
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:19.700]   You're below the mandoza line
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.020]   We need a mandoza line
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:28.500]   For phone prices and I think I got to say anything above a thousand bucks
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.220]   What are you smoking?
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.540]   No, can't do it too much
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.700]   It's not a laptop
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.900]   It's that's more than a laptop 1799. That's
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.780]   Is it crazy? Obviously. I say i'm saying doesn't think so
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:48.020]   Um, or do they do it just to say look how cool we are they're very good about
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.260]   Uh, uh trade-in
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.740]   A lot of people are getting their flip phones or their or their
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:58.980]   Fold 3 with trading in old samsung phone and getting enough off so it's not as crazy
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:06.660]   Goes from 1700 to 1200. Yeah, still yeah. No, stacey. Oh, sorry. I you were starting to say something nice step on you
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:10.340]   Oh, no, that's okay. I was just thinking about
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:16.020]   Oh, there there is an audience for these high price phones and eventually I mean
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:20.900]   It'll come down in price as the components scale. I mean they
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:27.700]   It's not though. That's the thing the full two was $1500. It's going up. Nobody nobody's buying it
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:30.020]   What's going on? It's only for the
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.940]   Misoptimism
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:38.980]   Well, I again i'm excited like that they're pushing so hard on this concept
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:44.900]   It may turn out to be economically unfeasible, but I like what they're doing enough people
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:49.860]   Hopefully we'll buy it that they're like let's keep trying and maybe we'll end up pushing the price down
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.740]   I mean like at $1000 would you buy at this phone? No
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:58.260]   Okay, I'm not a big fan of $1000
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:03.300]   I don't mind the price so much. I'm not a fan of folding phones as I said I had the fold to pay the crazy
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.980]   1500 bucks for it
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:08.180]   Uh after a while with not a lot of use the screen
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:13.940]   Uh, it comes with a kind of almost a rubbery screen protector started bubbling
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:18.100]   So I peeled it off against my better instincts remember the original Samsung Galaxy wall
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.260]   You peeled it off it broke it in this case
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:23.700]   I looked I read on read it and stuff they said you can take it off
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:28.660]   And in fact Samsung has a service that'll replace it for some fee, but I just took it off and it's fine
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:30.660]   And it's much actually a much nicer phone
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:35.220]   But I don't feel I feel like this is a flimsy technology now
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:40.740]   Maybe they've they've improved it. They say the protective film is now 80% stronger
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.780]   um
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:45.540]   Okay
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:49.700]   I feel like anything that's foldable is not gonna be so it's so stacy
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:54.420]   Let me ask you see what excited about the potential for it. What's the use case for folding
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:58:00.900]   You're uh that you have a smaller footprint of a device that then you can expand your screen size
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:06.580]   It's like a tablet in your pocket. I mean, that's that's all it is, but it's a pretty powerful concept
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.860]   I agree
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.860]   I dig that I would say
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:14.020]   if you could figure out how to the if you're thinking ahead
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:17.060]   to like software development on this thing and
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:21.140]   Designing for two screens right two separate screens running together
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:26.580]   So you could either have one app on each side or a unified app running across both then it becomes interesting
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:35.060]   If you think about having VR apps with you know, one eye getting this information another eye getting this information or kind of
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:43.620]   Interactive screens that are and I'm just thinking about like we need these kind of middle ground hardware steps to get us to
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:50.900]   That future where we're like throwing up screens everywhere and tap and stuff. I don't know. I'm excited just because I like
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:56.100]   I like innovation. I like people trying and if it's a dead end, it's a dead end, but you know
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:02.580]   I I completely agree with you. I completely and Samsung makes so much money on it's because it has a hundred different models
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:06.740]   And they make so much money on the other models that I think it's reasonable for them to say okay
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:11.300]   And we're gonna offer one model that's so expensive. Nobody you know, it's a for a limited limited number of people
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:15.460]   but we can try things for instance the camera on the
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:21.860]   Inside is uh goes through the screen. There's no whole punch. There's no notch. That's cool
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:26.660]   Uh, yeah, that's good. I mean we want to see those kinds of innovations other phones will eventually have them
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:32.660]   I'm sure actually the new google pixel six it has a through the screen fingerprint reader
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:36.820]   Which others have done before but I mean that's that's you got us there's going to be innovation
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:39.940]   So mr. Stacey you're saying this is more like a pilot
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.500]   Program is how we should look at this?
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:46.100]   I yeah, like they're they're trying an idea
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:52.180]   It is maybe samson doesn't think they're doing it, but that's what's happening here
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:57.700]   You know, they pitched gaming content, uh, you know watching movies
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.180]   um, they pitched
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.500]   You know, this is this is they showed how?
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:08.420]   Applications can much as you would on a computer have two pains or even more
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.940]   Uh, you know as you read your email the list on the left the mail is on the right
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.420]   All of those things are are nice on a bigger screen
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.220]   You know
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:23.220]   Some of this comes from the fact that apples just completely dominant in the tablet space samson's the next biggest competitor
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.940]   But I think apple just owns them with the ipad
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:29.300]   And they chose out a different way to say that this is a way to to
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.380]   um
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:37.860]   Lays a trail toward reinvigorating the tablets and yeah, it well and remember that um
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.500]   Uh, you know
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.820]   Sam's instead of still tablets, but apple doesn't have anything in this kind of smaller
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.540]   Mid-range
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:51.460]   So there's something that's somewhere in the continuum between a phone and a tablet
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.540]   Samsung is for years was laughed at for making the note
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.020]   People said oh that's such a big phone nobody and it and it was a huge success
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:03.540]   And because of it now everybody else is making big phones right now
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:09.380]   Samsung showed the way with a note so it's could very well be something like that they've they've had a history of that
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:15.060]   Um, I would not buy when having had the the fold two. I don't think the fold three is going to be
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:20.980]   You know things like the aluminum and the fold three's hinge is now 10% stronger
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.660]   Oh, well, that's a relief
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.940]   I see somebody coming out of the lab
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.220]   Weave your report is 10% stronger
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:36.580]   I feel like that's just the marketing people like well, okay. We got a bottle
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:41.860]   We don't have metrics on these yet. So, uh, let's focus on this because this is what
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:47.620]   20% say it there's a there is a problem with these phones because you can't really put a case on them
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:50.420]   The samsung case that they sold in the fold too
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:58.580]   Was just a shell that went over one side of it and so you're carrying this thing which costs a horrific amount of money
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:03.940]   Is undoubtedly very fragile and you don't even know even way to protect it
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:10.580]   When I was shooting pictures with my fold too, it's like don't drop it leo at 1,600 dollars down the tubes
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.580]   It's just scary and so there's there's issues too
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:20.980]   Yeah, and I feel like from a marketing perspective if if apple had brought us a foldable phone
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:26.820]   They would not be telling us the hinges or 10% stronger. They would distract us from the frailty of it by telling us
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:32.500]   Now your phone is like a book or a world with isn't you know, right?
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:38.500]   And so quite this is like y'all would be more excited if samsung's marketing team were a little less, you know
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:44.100]   Uh, we got to address this issue of the the wimpy the wimpy fold, you know, right?
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:50.900]   You know, there's a reason apple doesn't make one. I guess what he has right after that
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:55.300]   Uh, but they'll make one if sam's son can make this feasible
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:03:00.740]   I guarantee someone at apple is thinking about foldable phones and oh, I'm sure they have prototypes you bet
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.300]   But I think what they're phone this
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.660]   I'm sorry
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:09.140]   fold and phone this side. Uh, I got a tweet from mokman last week
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:14.180]   Basically saying okay thousand dollar phones. Why is it not worth it to me?
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.660]   Don't I use a phone every single day?
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.100]   And
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:22.820]   My logic is okay if I use it every single day that doesn't necessarily make it worth
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:31.140]   Thousand dollars if I can't run certain things on it on a smaller screen that a laptop can do for me on a bigger screen
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:36.340]   I mean, I'm the guy who paid $2400 for an ipad. I'm not
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:40.260]   No, no, I'm like a completely
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:45.060]   To overspending on technology that's just wrong
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.740]   Come on
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:51.060]   But I don't anticipate sitting in a tree in a beautiful yellow print dress
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:56.020]   Staring at my folding phone. This just doesn't look like something i'm going to be doing
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:00.420]   It's it isn't quite big enough to be honest with you. It's big
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:08.420]   I salute the engineering efforts. I do I salute engineering efforts, but at the same time they lose me
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.420]   uh
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:12.660]   Just because of my pragmatism
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.540]   I'm looking at how much this thing is going to cost me and is it going to be worth what I pay for it?
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:18.580]   Is $1700
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.620]   No, no, no, no, no
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:23.540]   Yeah, yeah, and you're and you're in the vast majority obviously and I don't think Samsung
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.220]   They don't I they understand that if they sell a million of these they'll be thrilled
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.460]   You know, they're not expected to be a huge hit
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:33.380]   uh, how many people do you think are interested in a folding phone?
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.500]   um
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500]   Functionality anyway, just
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.060]   People are really excited about it
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.780]   Hmm. I'm excited about it. I have
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:48.500]   I have I have smaller hands. I have tiny pockets if I can fold something up and then make it big
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:54.580]   Great. What about the flip the flip? Have you looked at the Samsung flip because that's basically a flip phone
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:58.820]   That's even smaller and I think that's kind of cool looking. That's a that looks great
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:03.380]   Another nice engineering feat looks looks great and they added a larger
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:07.700]   Uh outer screen on it. It's actually functional. That's that's great
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.420]   Still not paying a thousand dollars for it
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.980]   How about this league of legends on a 7.6 inch screen
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:18.580]   Talk about immersion
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.500]   It's like you're playing on a pocket handkerchief
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.980]   Here and I just unfold this just to give yourself
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:32.260]   The a little bit of the experience look at that. Wow. No, this my handker just bigger than this
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:39.940]   Bigger. I spent more than my father spent on a board mustang so I can play a game. Yeah, that's right
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.820]   But you're not your father
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.420]   So and if you bought a Ford Mustang today, it would be a little bit more than this
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.060]   Yes
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:51.060]   120 Hertz main screen
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.660]   It's got a lot of the features of the top flagship phones these days
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:06:00.100]   I have to say I'm much more excited about the pixel six, which is probably why google pre-announced that right
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:04.900]   Because that now i'm not even tempted. It's like I know a pixel six is coming in a couple of months
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.980]   I haven't bought a samsung phone since
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:14.020]   The galaxy nexus. Oh, I thought you were a samsung guy for some reason
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.340]   Never I
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.900]   I like the note. I never really liked the
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.780]   The span of android that it ran
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:27.300]   Years ago. Yeah, they ran in their version of android got much better, but i'm used to the
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:32.420]   nexus line of uh, os and just been stuck ever since
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:38.820]   I have to say the cameras are pretty good in samsung. They do they are over over saturated. Yep
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:43.860]   Uh, you know if you look at paul tharot's instagram. He's been posting
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:49.060]   uh pictures using his wife's uh samsung galaxy s 20
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:56.340]   And uh, they really look good there. It's a good camera for what he's using it for which is yeah kind of he's he's in
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:59.460]   Mexico and he's just going around taking pictures of food and stuff
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:05.060]   Yeah, and it's it's great. I mean these are these are beautiful images. They're not aunt prue it beautiful
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:09.140]   Oh, it looks great. They're nice, right? Yeah, I totally agree. Yeah
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:16.020]   So that's I think that's the market and the camera and uh in the galaxy is going to be similar
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:19.780]   I think just as good but what's neat about the galaxy i have to admit for this
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:23.460]   This is the case for the fold you get a great big viewfinder
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:29.860]   And when I was shooting pictures when I wasn't worried about dropping the thing it was really nice to be able to see an image
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:35.620]   Mm-hmm at the size of a print right? Yeah, that's that's cool inside of light room
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.100]   That's pretty nice. Yeah
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:42.580]   I've been lately. I've been using my ipad for doing photo editing because it's nice and see it
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:47.380]   You know on a beautiful screen at just about that much on it. You gotta do something with it. I know
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:51.140]   Okay, that's that's actually that's actually the truth
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:57.860]   That's that's the real reason I'm I gotta have something I gotta do more than slack on this thing. Oh, man
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:09.060]   Uh our strongest aluminum frame yet. It's super strong yet like 10% stronger tempers is like a suit of armor
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:16.580]   But what is the suit of armor protect the interior parts of the hinge they're really protected
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:24.660]   I don't know. All right. We get we don't get good. Do they recognize that problem though with the hinge? Um, yeah, I did enjoy that little
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:29.540]   Motion gravity that they put up to show how they've addressed that problem because that's cool
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:35.940]   He's been that much money and a drop of water getting there and ruin it. That's oh or sand people were getting grit
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:38.100]   Oh, yeah, early funds
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.420]   So I would I maybe I should get a flip
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:43.060]   What do you think this one?
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:51.540]   If you I think it's cute. Yeah, this is for you. It's slick. This is this is to go in your small pockets your pocket book
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:54.660]   No, well, I don't have a pocket book
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:09:00.900]   A pocket board does anybody have a pocket book anymore? That's where I keep my checkbook
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.380]   Mother
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:08.820]   Yeah, mother they want to do it rest women and they decided to make it precise because all the men decided that's what they should do
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.820]   A precise cheese
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:16.100]   So this is what I don't like about the flip is it's uh, it looks like a clothespin on the side
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:19.780]   There's this gap. Oh the air gap microsoft did the same thing
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:22.740]   I don't like that. Ah, it bugs me
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:29.380]   It should fall flat. That's so CD so well. It's so the screen doesn't yeah, that's definitely I agree. Yeah
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:39.060]   All right, I'm not gonna buy it. I just I just got completely turned off. All right, it's fine
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.740]   I don't want to spend a thousand dollars on that phone
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:48.260]   No, but I would do it for like 750 well with trade in I fact there's somebody in our discord who's getting it
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:52.900]   I think we're 400 or something with trade in so oh nice. Yeah, but I've only got a pixel
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.460]   Yeah, you'd have to have a good trade in
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.100]   Did you notice them?
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:06.660]   Previously they wouldn't even mention and draw your never said nations. Yeah, but now with wear o s uh it was sort of
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.740]   jarring to hear them even mention where o s
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:14.980]   teaming up with the thizin version, right
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.060]   I'm actually I think this has been this is good for both google and
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:24.180]   Samsung finally Samsung admits that yeah, we're using right. Yeah, you got a problem with that
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:27.940]   and and I actually i'm going to buy this watch because
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:34.500]   The problem with the wear watch all along was google specified the hardware platform
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.620]   And it was a really anemic Qualcomm processor
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:42.500]   That had poor battery life now they're going to use a much more modern Samsung processor
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.580]   That's what google got out of this thizin deal
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:52.020]   So I actually ordered a uh a galaxy watch for classic because it's got that I really
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:57.380]   Have you ever used one of these with a spinning bezel the bezel that will be the route I wanted to go. Yeah, um
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:04.740]   I always like their original gear for watches and i'm saying sounds like somebody's phone is ringing here in the house
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:10.660]   They won't pick up but I've always liked the larger watch faces just because I have larger hands
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.980]   So it makes me had to have a galaxy phone and all of that stuff with it
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:18.340]   But now I like this option i'm thinking this and the pixel six
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:23.940]   And uh, and maybe this is my answer to apples privacy the privacy issue is just
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.220]   Go to a privacy folk much more privacy centric
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:32.820]   The device I don't know I didn't buy the lte version because I don't want it to be always
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:35.540]   connected to the network
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:39.060]   I don't know we'll see i'll get it. I'll let you know i'll give you a review
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.500]   I'm sure Jason will have a review of both the flip and the fold
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:46.180]   I pray to god he's not buying it with my credit card
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:51.300]   Oh god
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:58.020]   Uh, what was what was the story you wanted to bring up stacey now that we've covered that I was excited about google's uh work on
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.580]   protecting teens and
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:05.780]   There were a couple good things that I thought was worth talking about just probably because I have a teenager
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.340]   But like you know, I've complained a long time about like
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:13.620]   Most of the policies are addressed to like kids at the age of 13. They're like, oh 13
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:18.020]   You're an adult now according to the DCMA and or not the DCMA your own
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:21.940]   CPPA yeah or daca or whatever it is I can never have all these
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:26.180]   Not daca, but yes, I dream of being 18 someday
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:31.300]   So yeah, basically you're on your own. Here's the whole wide world of the internet
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.940]   You're like 13 year old really isn't ready for that
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.220]   Um, so google's done some good things. They they've talked about
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:42.020]   Not advertising certain classes to them, but I really thought it was great that it lets
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:50.180]   Kids pull their images before the age of 13. Yes, and that's so key because you know
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:55.140]   One your parents we didn't do this to our kid, but parents put up images that
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.780]   Kids may not want we have this I wish you
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.940]   Everybody could do this
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.940]   Well, yeah
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.980]   I would love google to pull but this is not the right to be forgotten
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.100]   This is well, it is but it's the right to be forgotten for it under eight
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:13.620]   It's the right to be stupid when you're a kid and not have that haunt you for the rest of your life
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:18.340]   So yeah, so uh, Mindy brooks general manager of google kids and families
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.540]   wrote wrote up a blog post
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:28.500]   If you are under 18 you or your parent or guardian can request the removal of your image from google image results
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:34.980]   That's not gonna remove it from the web obviously, but if you can't find it on google it pretty much is pretty much doesn't exist
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.820]   Um, I have to think that gosh if I were in high school today
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:44.980]   Does this remove it from facebook? No, it's still on facebook, but at least it doesn't show up in search right
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:47.940]   Right. It's not if someone searches for your name
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:51.380]   Like if you search for my name you get all kinds of images
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:55.540]   But you know they aren't because people didn't have smartphones when I was a kid
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:00.260]   You're not gonna find the I feel so bad images of me smoking a cigarette, right, right?
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.820]   while robbie seedy
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:06.420]   Who did she only would do it while robbing liquor stores? It wasn't
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:13.460]   Yeah, yeah, it wasn't like all the theater kid occasionally like I remember because we used to have to get our photos developed
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.620]   And so like I would give them to my parents and they would take them to like wall greens develop them
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:22.500]   And then I remember getting in so much trouble because one of my friends was taking a cigarette and one of the pictures
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:26.100]   And my parents saw
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:34.820]   I mean, yeah, so those are the things you're you're you're why did I was not a lot of
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.500]   Smoking
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.500]   Yes, I wasn't allowed to hang out with them anymore
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.380]   What and this by the way, this is this is apple
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:46.260]   Uh, this is the kid in the photo mark becomes the equivalent of apple
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.580]   Yeah, that's worse, isn't it?
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:52.980]   Actually, that's a good point. Our pictures weren't private when we had to get to all
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:59.380]   Oh, there were a bunch of cases about that you can I mean if you want to look up child porn and photo development you go right ahead
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:02.340]   I'm not going to give your kid a bath and take a picture of it got people
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:07.220]   Yeah, and trouble big trouble. Yeah, that's actually a really good point
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.140]   Oh, finally we said it earlier
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:17.460]   Anyway, I just thought this was really good and worth like i'm glad and it's because of and I should point this out
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:22.660]   It's because of google's doing this because of new regulations being introduced in other countries
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:28.420]   Which to me is a signal that regulations can be helpful in driving
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:31.300]   companies to do better because clearly
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.460]   Google really didn't care about this until that point. I completely agree with you
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:38.500]   Well, I'd say it's another way to look at it is
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:46.660]   The way right to be forgotten exists. I have a lot of objections too, but it does it does take somebody sitting down and saying hmm
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:50.820]   Forget regulation forget courts forget all of that
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:58.340]   What power should an individual have of their own stuff? Yeah, is an interesting question to that explore which is what google's done in essence. Yeah
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:02.660]   Yeah, i'm glad you put that up regulations. That's a good one
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.820]   Yeah
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:10.820]   And then we'll and we'll do it in the changelog, but there's other things google is doing to give kids and families a better experience
[01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:11.700]   online
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:17.540]   Oh, yeah, like turning off auto play by default for kids under 18. We've talked about really it. How will luya?
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:23.700]   And they get break reminders, which I don't know about y'all, but when i'm in tiktok and they give me the break reminders
[01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.620]   Are they tell you?
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:31.220]   Well, I feel bad about them. I'm like, oh, you know what? They're probably right, but then i'm like
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:35.780]   This abdicting me so watch my two more videos and then I go off
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:42.180]   Yeah, just to show my independence i'm gonna watch two more and then i'll take it off
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.380]   I'll show you algorithm also
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:48.580]   For kids under 18
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:55.620]   Uh the default upload setting will be private for our youtube videos, which I think is a good safeguard
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:58.900]   Absolutely, you could make it public, but it'll be private by default
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.900]   Um, there's also location history and other changes
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:09.140]   Uh, but we'll talk about that in the cool changelog, which is still to come
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:15.060]   Marjorie Taylor green strike for you know baseball
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:17.780]   The face only get three
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:22.500]   Yeah, uh, she's got four one more though you get five strikes on twitter
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:28.900]   One more and uh she might get banned forever. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna go out on a limb here
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:35.860]   Make a prediction that that's her goal and you will have a fizz strike coming up to bat as we speak
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.940]   Yes and swing it away
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.980]   Uh last month
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:45.540]   Last month twitter instituted a five strikes policy
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:50.100]   Uh, she has been banned now four times for tweets saying the coronavirus
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.660]   Not dangerous if you're under 65
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:55.380]   And not fat
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:00.980]   Actually, who's gonna ban joe rogan for saying all you got to do is eat right and and not get fat. You'll be fine
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.620]   Who's gonna ban joe rogan for though?
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:08.740]   His his company should spot if i ought to be saying something yes, they ought to be
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:13.540]   You know, that's the problem with misinformation. You can't you can't shut it down. You can't
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:16.660]   um
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.420]   The tweet was labeled as well. There was an example today leo of
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:24.340]   Uh, what was it? I don't think i put it on the rundown a
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:31.780]   Somebody at facebook or twitter or so I took down russian disinformation that uh, the vaccination turns you into a monkey
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:38.900]   You know and at some point has anybody wait a minute, but i'm just curious has anybody been turned into a monkey
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:42.500]   Just check. Well, that's the thing asking for anybody's gonna believe that
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:49.060]   You give people no agency at all you think that they're so stupid at some point
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.860]   Maybe you'll let the stupidity out
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:56.180]   I I think it just shows yet why cover for them
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:19:01.460]   I don't know I you know, I have mixed feelings because of course people who do believe
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:04.180]   uh, people like representative green
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:08.580]   And might in fact get influenced by that and get sick and die
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:14.100]   You know, she's spreading bad information. Let's save some lives but
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:20.580]   On this hand no data on what the actual impact of these kinds of lives is we scream about how they're out there
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:28.900]   And my god every single morning now mica on morning. Joe is screaming about facebook being the source of all evil in the world
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.460]   Yeah, and I repeat if we turn it off
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:37.620]   Uh, they can fix anything. Yeah, um, I hope we will later get to the story about the super about
[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:40.420]   Do you think she should have been banned or no?
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:48.500]   Sure, sir. I think they should do more than they've just taken down the fending tweets and I think they should I think she's awful
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.180]   And they should she's not getting the message. Obviously. She wants to garden party rule
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:54.260]   Yeah, well, they this is their garden party
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:54.820]   Yeah
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:59.380]   If you can if she came to my god forbid if she came to my garden party and said what she said
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:04.420]   I would tell her to leave because it's my garden party. This is dinner's garden party
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:07.300]   bron paul
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:10.900]   banned from youtube for seven days starting yesterday
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:17.380]   He posted a video claiming that cloth masks are not effective now that he's more hazardous because a he's a doctor
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.100]   He's a physician
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:28.980]   Um sorts. Oh, yeah. Well, he's with an ophthalmologist, right? I mean, it's not exactly his specialty, but he he get a get an mb to do that
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:32.500]   Um, the other problem is it's not true
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:39.940]   And it might discourage people from using from cloth masks. He says the most of the masks you get over the counter don't work
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:43.220]   Um
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:45.700]   Of course, bran paul immediately went
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:52.580]   And paul ran and I said run daddy ros like daddy runs big daddy's so broad the son big boy ran
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:56.500]   uh paul took twitter to express his disagreement with youtube's decision
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:03.460]   Quote a badge of honor left wing creeks at youtube banning me for seven days for a video
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:08.020]   That quotes two peer reviewed articles saying cloth masks don't work
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:12.020]   And then you have glenn reynwald who's it's own band appears to
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:18.900]   Screaming about how how this is awful and evil that they would get rid of a us senator and they shouldn't do this and
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:27.540]   It's a tough one. We did that. We did that um survey that twitter survey shows how hard it is to make these decisions
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.620]   Yes, I think
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.860]   You know, and so there's a lot of things you could say that would be untrue that would not get you banned from twitter
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:39.540]   Or youtube but that there are things that are dangerous to public health
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:44.740]   That you know, you probably don't want people to say especially wrong state authority
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:50.500]   Yeah, I think that's the wrong standard. I think that because we don't really know the danger
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:56.420]   I would argue we don't we don't know how much people really are influenced by this and this alone and again
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:00.020]   We're gonna get I'm gonna run with since we get to the story later about about
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:04.020]   youtube and political revitalization and the study thereof
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:05.780]   um
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:07.780]   So I think the standard is not that in this case
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:10.020]   I think the standard is the garden party standard of saying
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:13.300]   We just don't want you telling what whatever the effect is
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.620]   We just don't want this here on our place and it's our right not to have it and we're gonna tell you get off
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:22.900]   No, I think that's the way to to do it and and that requires them to set standards
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:26.900]   And they're scared of that but I would like to see them start to set standards of their own
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.540]   View of what should be on and off their platforms
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:32.740]   Let's do that youtube story
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:37.300]   Um, is that did you put that in here somewhere? I'm looking for I did I said I'm dry
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:40.180]   Would it be under youtube could it be under there? I don't know
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:42.180]   I don't know what the other there
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:50.180]   This is uh study probably it is line 68. I know you don't like the line number no no I love line
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:54.660]   youtube's algorithm is apparently according to a study
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:59.700]   Um by a bunch of people with Arab names, but okay
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:06.900]   No, no, no, no, no, no including. Yes, david roth's child and don't can watch well, you know the roth child's
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:09.780]   Okay, I'm just i'm bad
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.980]   I'm sorry. I am so sorry. Don't forget. I even said this
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:17.380]   Examining the consumption of radical content on youtube is a study from stanford
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:21.780]   Oh, no, I'm sorry. It's edited by stanford. It is a study from
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.660]   university of pennsylvania harvard temple
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:27.860]   collard uc boulder
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:30.820]   My son's alma mater san of fe institute
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:36.820]   Microsoft research and the anenberg school of communications. Okay. I guess those are okay
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.380]   prestigious
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:43.380]   I don't see yale in there, but okay. I'll take harvard news a reason why
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:51.460]   Daily share of news consumption on youtube is social media platform bubble blah
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:56.580]   Uh, we identify several distinct communities of news consumers including
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.860]   Pick the one you think jeffson far right
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:02.740]   anti woke
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:08.740]   Far right is small and not increasing in size over the observation period while anti woke
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:14.020]   Four year period from 2016 and both grow in consumption per user
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:21.540]   but yet the anti woke is very interesting because it it is a huge growing part and it's not just you know
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:26.980]   It's the harper's letter. It's the intellectual dark web people. It's the
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:32.180]   New York times op ed columnist who complained about cancel culture
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:38.660]   And they don't realize how much they are being used by the far right, which is what comes out of the study
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:43.780]   Is it the the the sites who think of themselves as anti woke don't think they're necessarily far right
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:50.020]   But their viewers are far right and their messages are being used on the far right and it's a really interesting
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.140]   Pickup that I haven't seen anywhere on this kind of new
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:55.540]   school of
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:59.620]   Thought so anyway keep going representative panel 300,000 americans
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:06.420]   Looking at their individual level browsing behavior on and off youtube january 2016 through january
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.980]   2019
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:15.300]   We found news. Oh, sorry to 720 news consumption on youtube is dominated by mainstream and largely centrist
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:23.460]   Sources consumers are far right content while more engaged and average represent average or was it a small and stable percentage of news consumers
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.580]   But consumption of anti woke content
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:34.580]   Uh, grew steadily in popularity and is correlated with consumption of far right off content off platform
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:40.660]   However, this is the point you wanted to make there's no evidence that engagement with far right content is caused
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.300]   By youtube recommendations, right?
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:47.620]   And so I I you can't get access to it because i'm a professor
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.860]   I got access to the whole paper and read it all
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:54.740]   And um, thank you my library nor they also looked at the pathways
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:26:00.260]   Nor is there clear evidence that anti woke channels serve as a gateway to the far right or right right?
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:08.260]   So the the pathways they looked at and they said the pathways by which users reach far right videos are diverse and only a fraction can
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:14.580]   Possibly can plausibly be attributed to platform recommendations. Where are those platforms primarily?
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:20.260]   50 percent of far right and right videos and more than 30 percent of anti woke videos are begun
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:26.500]   After visiting a right or far right news domains such as fox news bright barre com or info wars.com
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:31.460]   And what they're saying is this ain't just an algorithm on youtube. It ain't just youtube
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:36.500]   It's over arching not just the web. It's also over arching media
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:40.260]   And and that that's what we have to to watch here
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:44.180]   And and understand and so I think it was it was a good sensible report
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:48.020]   Now the problem is because they only put out the summary people started reacting to that
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:55.460]   And and if you read the whole report, it's very good now some researchers say the problem here is they couldn't see what was being recommended to people
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:00.020]   And that's right. We want youtube to release more data here so we can get a better sense of this
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:05.220]   But they had what's important about this study is that they could see not just their youtube behavior
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:10.980]   Which is so often the case with these things because they used the nilsen panel. They saw their behavior across multiple
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:18.020]   uh domain but multiple media and multiple domains among media, which is really important zenep to ficki who is also a
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:19.620]   professor
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:23.700]   Yes, and so got to read this said you got my hopes up
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:34.100]   But the independent research said they didn't have the recommendation they they didn't have the recommendation so
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:40.980]   But they acknowledge that fully in the paper. They need they need data from youtube is what they need you always need more data. Yes
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:47.860]   Um, so I think this is a good preliminary study. I think it isn't you can't all this it is you shouldn't defend every study
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:51.620]   Yeah, but it's maybe premature to derive a hard
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:56.500]   uh conclusion from this but it's interesting and um and we need to know more
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:01.380]   What the hell was that what was that?
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:05.380]   You know, stacy you need a waffle is your stomach talking to you
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:08.660]   Oh, no, it's a dog. It's not me
[01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:11.380]   Kind of as a sleep. Oh, he's dreaming
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.900]   He's dreaming
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:20.820]   He's chasing something in his dreams if you had a little camera. I'd have you move it so we can see but you can't
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:26.180]   So cute. He has it you didn't remove his vocal cords or anything. He's he can bark normally, right?
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:28.260]   Oh, yeah, he he can definitely bark
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.140]   Okay, but he's just in his dreams. He barks like a
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:38.900]   Dream now. He sounds like a small dog when he's not I do have a close-up picture provided by matthew in our discord chat
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:47.300]   Yeah, add about another 90 pounds to that dog
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:51.220]   And you have kylo, I feel so
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:54.660]   He's dreaming of biting rand paul says see
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:58.820]   Got him worked up. Oh, that's why i sound like
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.700]   Uh
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:05.860]   Let's see let's have some more hold on sec though. We'll take a little break here so we can breathe
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:08.820]   Because I think the temperature is increasing
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:11.140]   *sigh*
[01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:19.300]   You know, I'm one of those jerks when they come at meetings and they say let's have an icebreaker
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:25.220]   I you hate that I hate it and then what's gets me more is oh, that's all breathe
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:28.260]   I'm gonna hold my breath
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:32.900]   I don't like breathing. I don't want to breathe. I'm not breathing. I'm not breathing
[01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:36.500]   Come on
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:40.020]   Jeff you were just like me when I refused to listen to the tiktok people
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:45.460]   Listen to the tiktok people that feels like that should be a song
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:52.020]   Um now you're motivating me to find some more tiktok people to put on the rundown next time. Oh, I love the tiktok people
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:56.740]   All right, I'll do all right. I'll do in fact my son who now has 50,000 followers on tiktok
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:30:00.100]   as well he shows and feels that he is on his way
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:03.940]   To tiktok fame and fortune. He just wants to make
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.660]   a living on tiktok
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:09.060]   Yeah, if he in you by the way, you can
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:11.060]   Yeah, why not?
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:15.220]   He should and and he wants to go to Asia and be able to just kind of go around Asia
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:17.860]   Enjoy himself going around Asia
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:24.100]   Doing travel and food videos and if he gets he says he still needs you know, maybe a hundred thousand
[01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:29.060]   But he's got very good engagement and all he does is do pictures of things being cooked
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:32.900]   But boy, they sure look good. They do man
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:38.500]   He does one takaritos every day. This is today's yeah, look at that
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:42.100]   Starts with tomatillos
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:46.740]   And then you blend them up in the queasian art you make some takmatao sauce
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:51.060]   You cook up some chicken with some paprika and shredded you put in the takmatao sauce
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:56.820]   You roll that up a little tortilla and you fry that then you put some avocado and some takmatao sauce
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:01.300]   And you pour it over the top of a little sour cream fully self-taught. Yeah, I think yeah
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:05.540]   I said look if you want to go to the culinary academy, just tell me
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:09.060]   I will sponsor you because I want you to cook this for meat
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.820]   Yeah
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:13.380]   Meat he's like I don't need this kind of pressure
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:20.580]   122,000 likes on this one. That's pretty good. This is yeah, let's get in there
[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:26.020]   Put up this morning at 9 a.m. So it's funny all those people should be following him
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:32.340]   Yeah, follow him those 70 people housing who aren't yet following him follow follow hank salt
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.740]   underscore hank follow the man
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:41.460]   Follow the man 60,000 followers. I don't think I could follow him just because I look at that and I'm like
[01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:45.460]   I need fun. I know that's not
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:50.660]   Hungry look at that and not you know like tonight. I'm making like chicken and broccoli that is
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:53.060]   I know it really puts you to shame doesn't it
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:59.220]   And then I said but Hank because he doesn't put the uh, I said you need to do because I see this with other shicktakers
[01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:06.100]   Captions he's a no, no, no man. It spoils the spoils the flow. He says I put the captions on instagram
[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.420]   So he has a multi
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.300]   Foreign
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:10.660]   approach
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.820]   So the recipe is on instagram
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:16.020]   And I said well, you know, also you can't need to post on youtube
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:23.780]   And so that's that's his trick smart. Isn't that smart? I said that's good because you don't want to be dependent on any one platform
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:26.100]   That much i've learned
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:30.180]   My co-loan does it so that one that he made there he makes one every day so i'm gonna make it
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:36.420]   I guess a few hours. He's a very good editor now. So I don't know exactly but he says he does one every day. So
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:39.620]   It is his full-time job apparently
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:48.660]   No, actually no dream i am i am not uh, i'm not gonna say that it's not fair
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:54.100]   He he takes gigs doing he shoots weddings do like four or five weddings this month. He shoots weddings
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:58.580]   He does drone stuff. He does other stuff, but it's all gig. You know, I feel like this generation
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:03.860]   What about your son? Is it is it all is it gig work yet or is he wanted to have a nine to five
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:10.500]   Well gig would be Jake the problem. Jake is gonna sell yourself constantly. It's hard work much harder work
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:15.060]   And you and you tempted to work more than 40 hour weeks
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:19.140]   You don't want to turn down anything because you don't want to come in next or not come in next sure
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:26.180]   Yeah, I don't know. What do you think? What do you think your boys will do take a nine to five or become gig workers?
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:33.220]   I think they're going to start out nine to five, but they both seem to have an entrepreneurial spirit
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:35.540]   And want to do their own
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:36.820]   generation
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:42.980]   But they want to they but I mean they also understand you know what I need to build up to that right so
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:47.780]   My kids just said build up schmilled up. I'm just i'm going straight in
[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:51.940]   I'll build up on dad's my dad's dime
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:59.700]   Well, see I think the being able to build up to it is is beneficial because you could learn from you got to work
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:07.220]   Of the degree. It's great to learn from mistakes that you make. I can agree. I learned my work ethic working at mcdonald's. I mean it really
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:09.620]   You know it
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.620]   Have to having to show up at a job
[01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:15.540]   Having a boss all that stuff is not fun necessarily, but you do learn a lot
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:20.340]   When I used to work in a bird seed plant and do roofing
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:25.140]   I learned that I didn't want to do that the rest of my life. Yeah, that's the other thing you learn
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:30.660]   Roofing the worst anything having commercial hot and hard
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:33.700]   Well, not just hot tar, but
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:35.940]   You can fall
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.860]   Yeah, this was commercial buildings. Um
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:42.740]   The biggest project that I did was firm and university. Oh nice
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.900]   They're um, they're
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:50.260]   At the time new basketball arena was being resurfaced and I was upon that
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:52.980]   With the team
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.140]   Yeah, I didn't want to do that the rest of my life
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:35:00.020]   That's he it's funny that jeff should have focused on that because i'm much more interested in the bird seed job
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:02.260]   Were you in charge of more than i wasn't
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:07.140]   Wasn't a shop. It was an actual plant where making our second
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:12.420]   Yeah, we they had all of these big silos and and everything gets mixed together and
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:19.460]   And dropped in the bags and I was stacking 50 pound bags of seed all day long onto pallets
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:24.740]   That was it grab it off the line to stack it onto a pallet forklift comes and pick it up
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:31.140]   That's it just 50 pounds over and over. I wanted you to say no, I was the millet man. I was in charge
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:38.260]   I was working my way up to sunflower seeds millet and fissile someday someday I hope to do a suit
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.900]   But uh right now i'm working on my millet
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:46.260]   Millet thistle and corn those are the big ones you did timmons arena
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:49.860]   No, it was audubon friends audubon
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:53.060]   Yeah, I think it's called audubon friends and firmer
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.900]   And beautiful. I want to say he got ended up buying them out
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:00.100]   Uh, long people I think scott's ended up buying them out
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:06.740]   You know I went to the the firman paladins.com site and they said you running an ad blocker
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:15.540]   Like wait a minute you kidding me. Yeah, no ad blockers loud. Oh man. I had a white list them
[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:20.420]   Uh-huh big I thought really good takedown
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:26.980]   Cory doctor. I had two count him two links to his plural pluralistic.net blog today
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:32.020]   This is the other one end of the line for uber. I thought this was really
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:34.740]   Good. He says uber is a bezel
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:41.060]   Bezizie le it's a term I wasn't familiar with he defines it as the magical interview interval
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:44.820]   When a confidence trickster knows he has the money
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:48.980]   But the victim does not yet understand he has lost it
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:51.220]   Oh
[01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:54.260]   And he makes a very strong case and quotes
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.820]   uh a um
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:01.060]   A blog that has been for the last several years
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:09.380]   Talking about this, you know google. I mean uh uber's naked capitalism.com. Hubert horen 26
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:13.380]   analysis 26 analyses of uber
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.860]   and their uh
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:17.860]   quarterly results
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:22.500]   And the conclusion Hubert comes up with Hubert comes up with as well as Cory is
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:30.740]   This was never designed to make money. You know we all think oh yeah uber's gonna make money someday maybe when self-driving vehicles
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:39.300]   Never it was a set of Amazon as well and it's day. Yeah, but there is no there is no path to profit
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.460]   for uber
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:46.500]   Um, he said the pretense that self-driving cars would eliminate their labor costs. They knew this would never happen
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.980]   They spelled spent billions on a doomed effort
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:55.300]   Then had to bribe another company with a 400 million dollar investment to take its window dressing away. They sold it
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:58.740]   Uh uber didn't need self-driving cars
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:02.020]   It needed us to think it would have self-driving cars
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:06.740]   That way the company's Saudi owners could raise investment capital from subsequent
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:13.860]   Investors also known as suckers says Cory all the way up to the IPO cash out and walk away whistling
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:16.100]   innocently
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:20.180]   he says uber's almost out of cash at this point and uh
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:26.980]   You know uber loses as we've mentioned many times before a lot of money billions, but it claims it's making money
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:28.980]   He says how does it do this? Well it lies
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:36.180]   Simply uber choose boring old generally accepted accounting practices
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:38.740]   Stacy knows that is gap
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:46.740]   Yep gap and invents fast and fanciful new forms of mathematics. We're losing money is good actually good stuff
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:52.340]   Yeah, every quarter it releases new lies laid out like a profit and loss statement in every quarter
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:55.140]   Hubert horen shows it's losing money
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:01.780]   Uh, it's mid 2021. Cory says now and it uber is going broke
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:08.260]   Uh uber bailed or got kicked out of russia china indian southeast asia
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.820]   Um
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:17.060]   It so interesting a true accounting of the last quarter has uber losing 38 cents and every dollar it took in
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:24.100]   3.7 billion of its assets are actually worthless paper from failing overseas ride hale companies
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:29.780]   uber's cash reserve declined 4.7 billion dollars in 2020
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:33.540]   and 937 million more in the first half of this year
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:40.500]   They've got 6.7 billion in the bank down from 14.6 in 2019 in other words at this rate
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:44.580]   Uh
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:47.380]   They're gonna have a problem. So I just interesting
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:50.180]   Can you say the same for lift?
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:51.620]   Yeah, probably
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:54.900]   the point yeah the point Cory's making is
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.020]   while uber
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:02.740]   The problem with uber he says wasn't just that it was a rapey crimey crooked grift the other problem
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:07.300]   How is that the other problem with uber? I love cori doctor. Oh, he's the best writer ever
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:14.660]   The other problem with uber is also super smart and analytic the other problem with uber is that it's doomed and only exists today because of accounting fraud
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:18.420]   And the real problem is it's ruined cities
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:24.740]   because they've deferred investment in uh public transit public transit
[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:30.660]   And it is made it impossible both uber and lift took out all of the competition and there's
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:35.860]   Like we see this actually on bainbridge island. There's an argument to be made for local
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:38.900]   services to arise. Yeah
[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:43.140]   Um, so yeah, it's also given work
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:46.420]   And every time i've talked to a uber driver
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:50.020]   Um, they're not making a lot of money, but they love the freedom of it
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:54.180]   Right. I'm not saying that that's a bad thing and it
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:57.220]   Yes, but
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:41:02.020]   It might help that small segment of uber drivers and I don't think it helps all the uber drivers
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:05.700]   I think there's probably a segment of uber drivers who really who it works for them
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:08.260]   the rest are there because
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.780]   They have to be and it is an option or
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:18.020]   They try it and it they realize it doesn't work for them like I get really mad because my brother is
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:20.740]   Uh, he's a door dash driver
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:27.060]   And he's like, you know, I really want to buy a different car because I don't want my car to have all these miles on it
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:31.780]   And i'm like you are just subsidizing their business. That's exactly exactly the back of a
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:34.180]   Person who is not
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:36.180]   financially savvy. He's
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:38.020]   based he's
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.020]   very poor. I mean
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.020]   It drives it makes me very angry
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:48.580]   You could make the point and kori does that uber has victimized drivers. They've also victimized restaurants
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:50.260]   uh
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:52.020]   because
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:56.500]   Uh using seo to trick people into thinking they were ordering from restaurants directly
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:58.340]   Remember uber would set up
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:00.500]   Fake websites with that restaurant's name
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:06.980]   Non-consentually opting restaurants into its delivery service subsidizing meals to set prices below break even
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:10.420]   Once uber had diverted a restaurant's customers into relying on its service
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:14.180]   But the screws to restaurants forcing them to pay quote marketing fees
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:18.740]   On pain of having searches for their business diverted to uber-affiliated ghost kitchens
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:22.420]   Thousands of locally owned restaurants will not survive the pandemic
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:24.980]   Thanks to this parasitic conduct
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:28.100]   like doormen in hotels
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:32.500]   And uh uber is you know uber one prop 22 in california
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:36.580]   They spent more than 200 million dollars to get it to pass. I voted for it. I'm
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:40.260]   Having some second thoughts it formalizes. He says worker
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:43.460]   Misclassification allowing employers to fire union workers
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:48.820]   We hire them as independent contractors and take away their pay benefits and rights
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:52.500]   Uh horen by the way as a transportation analyst
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:56.260]   Um, so he has some you know knowledge in this
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:43:02.260]   I you know and by the way massachusetts I think is now going to have uh its own prop 22
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.260]   They're going to vote on the same
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.260]   uh the same thing
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:09.860]   So I think his point is uber is going to go away
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.020]   They're going to run out of money the con is done
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:19.620]   You know they everybody got rich through the ipos and so forth and of course the investors are going to be the ones that lose their shirts
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:22.340]   But they're also going to leave behind them a wreckage of
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:26.020]   Bad city infrastructure lack of mass transit
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:30.580]   Restaurants out of business and underpaid workers who now have cars
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:34.980]   with a lot of mileage on it and no and uh no job
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:38.740]   Well, and I would also say in addition to all of this
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:40.340]   We can't just look at uber
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:46.180]   We have to look at the people who funded them and recognize that this is a pattern that plays out across the industry
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:48.660]   in terms of saying
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:52.980]   We're going to fund winners. We're going to prop these people up with as much money
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:59.940]   Let them out spend their competition and then suddenly we're going to pull the rug out from everybody and they're going to look up and be like
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:02.660]   Oh, shoot
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:03.460]   Yeah
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.420]   Nothing exists
[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:08.100]   Well, and he even blames the wall street journal, which basically republished uber
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:10.980]   Press releases as news stories
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:17.220]   Uh uncritically, so there is a always do that. Yeah, there's a there's a you know, there's a system
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:20.660]   It's called capitalism. It's called late stage capitalism
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:27.300]   I am really distressed about late stage capitalism right now when it comes to the launch of the smart like
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:31.220]   Smart surveillance technologies and the need that we have
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:35.140]   Like iot could totally help us do so many awesome things
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:44.180]   Uh, like track pollution it could help create circular economies where we're actually smartly like fertilizing our plants and all that good stuff
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:47.460]   Right, but we can't believe any of this because
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:54.820]   The companies that are trying to sell us these things they just green wash or say that this is happening, right? But a lot of their
[01:44:54.820 --> 01:45:01.220]   The services they're building just feel like they're trying to nickel and die must to death
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:03.220]   And it's such a frustrating dynamic
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:09.300]   Let us wishful thinking to call it late state capitalism. I don't think it's late stage at all
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:17.700]   It's just capitalism plain old capitalism. Yeah. Yeah, it's unregular. You know what it is. It's unregulated cap unfettered capitalism
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:21.060]   I believe in cap letters. I think I think
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:26.500]   The market has brought us a lot of innovation. Not everything should be in the market health care is a good example
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:29.860]   Uh for profit health care clearly doesn't deliver good results
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:36.420]   But you know in general, it's a great engine for innovation and it's done very well by us
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:39.940]   But there there are problems with it and if it's unfettered
[01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:44.660]   It becomes predatory and I think this is a good example of predatory capitalism
[01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:49.780]   So maybe it's not late stage. Maybe it's just you know, maybe it started with tulip bulbs. I don't know
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:52.900]   Uh, let's play some drums and do
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:55.780]   the google change
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:57.860]   the google change log
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:04.740]   I love that guy. I gotta find out whose voice that is. He's the voice sounded different to me. Just them. I don't know why
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:07.860]   It did it was around john
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:14.500]   Didn't it? It's the same exact one we've always played you agree. That sounded different. It sounded different. Yeah, it did sound different
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:21.140]   I don't know john you've been doing something funny to us. He put he put some EQ on it or something
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:24.100]   Well, google change log
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:29.700]   I'm glad i'm not crazy. All three of us said it sounds. Yeah, that's I think you're all three crazies
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:34.820]   The only logical way to play it again john play it again sam
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:40.580]   The google change log
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:44.420]   It did
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:50.980]   I think it's EQ in zoom or something. I think somebody kidnapped the google change log guy
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:57.540]   You know, he was out there smoking a cigarette just a few minutes ago. I thought I saw i mean came running in
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:01.700]   I looked like this maybe it's maybe it's the mask makes it sound different. I don't know
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:07.860]   All right, he does have to wear a mask now the pixel 5a coming soon
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:13.220]   Um just in time for you not to get me the pixel six say
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:16.420]   Yeah, 450 dollars
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:18.500]   uh google has uh
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:25.940]   Has uh apparently confirmed it the device at the launch in two markets the us and japan on thursday
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:30.100]   This is a this part is the rumor on thursday august 26th
[01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:37.700]   For purchase online or in google stores. No carriers apparently with 6.4 inch display 60 hertz
[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:42.980]   I guess you could force 90, but you have to force it snapdragon 765 g
[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:49.460]   A 4650 milli amp hour battery no wireless charging six gigs of ram same camera as the pixel 5
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:51.940]   ip 67 rating
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:54.420]   It will have a headphone jack
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:58.420]   Please google put a headphone jack in the six
[01:47:58.420 --> 01:48:01.540]   I'll buy two of these that will be no
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:04.340]   Please
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:06.340]   Yeah, would you like a headphone jack?
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:11.140]   I would because it definitely sounds better, but at the same time
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:16.500]   I'm sort of used to having earbuds for phone calls. I know I really like headphones
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:20.260]   I actually bought an expensive hundred fifteen dollar
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:28.420]   Dac converter. Oh nice. It's plug into my phones. Yeah, so I could plug in headphones. It sounds better. It's a good dac
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.540]   Yeah
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:32.980]   Um, but jeez you shouldn't have to buy a hundred fifty dollar accessory
[01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:41.380]   But okay, mr. Laport you're gonna make me ask so you put a dac on your phone
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:47.940]   Wouldn't you rather listen to that music in your home and you're much bigger nice. Yeah, speaker
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:55.540]   Sometimes you you know like you're in an airplane or whatever you you want to have okay good quality use those sanheiser i 300s
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:57.620]   Which are really or yeah
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:01.300]   Your buds sounds so much better than a bluetooth
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:08.420]   Solution I agree. So my daughter when I play music fully in the home
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:13.540]   She hates it because it doesn't sound like this sound right she prefers
[01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:17.860]   crappy audio so she wants the tinny sound
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:23.380]   Or even the phone she's like I rather I'd like listening to music on my phone
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:28.340]   I was like like out loud on the speaker. She's like yeah, I think it sounds good. I'm not just her
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:30.980]   it's not just her
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:33.220]   michaels friends 18 years old
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:36.900]   They're listening they're playing the Beatles on his phone
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:43.540]   I said I have bluetooth speakers if you want or we can put it on the stereo and really send no no no we like it this way
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:52.980]   Kids today what's wrong with them?
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:55.380]   Vital
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.420]   Vital was no no we're not going that far but really
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:06.740]   False speakers not the best which I was like I was like really my generation and jeff's too probably
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:12.820]   I mean we listen to transistor radios right all of our original music with big antennae and that's by the way true
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:16.900]   I remember reading about Keith rittian and Keith rittches autobiography talks about
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:20.740]   Listening you know to pirate radio on the bbc and a little tiny
[01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:27.540]   Tinney speaker, but that's you know, that's what he heard and he loved it still so maybe I don't know
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:35.780]   Yikes, anyway the pixels launching with a headphone jack. That's the story. Hey, here's a great story. I love this
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:42.900]   Google is launching a program microsoft's done this others other some banks do this to hire more people with autism
[01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:48.260]   They're teaming up with stanford to make its workforce more neuro diverse
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:55.060]   Uh, this is fantastic. I have friends who have autistic kids who are great workers
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:51:00.100]   They're honest. They're hard workers because of their neuro diversity
[01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:04.020]   There's some things that they don't handle well like sometimes interactions with people
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:08.180]   But they are really good at doing the jobs they're assigned
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:17.380]   Google's autocle Google cloud's autism career program will work with experts from the stanford neuro diversity project to train as many as 500
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:24.420]   Google cloud managers and others who are integral in the hiring process to work more effectively with candidates who have autism
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:28.260]   I would say there's probably a lot of people on the spectrum in google already
[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:34.020]   Oh, I would imagine. Yes, but this is this is this is a really important. I think very very good
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:39.300]   I think this is a big step in general and and you know wesley flopner's been our shows talking about this
[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:43.940]   Uh, he's actually he gave a great speech about uh, neuro diversity
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:48.100]   That we should we have these notions that everybody should be like the same
[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:53.380]   And if we can if we can embrace neuro diversity sometimes that's where genius comes from worst pressure
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:52:00.260]   I think on all of us and especially on our kids today is the the idea of normal normal terrible idea
[01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:03.220]   No one is normal. There isn't such a thing as normal
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:08.900]   It's it's it's a construct that holds them to something so that when they all feel abnormal because we all are
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:10.980]   Because there isn't a normal
[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:14.660]   Uh, it puts terrible pressure on i've had that same conversation with my kids
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:19.780]   And that's the problem in a way with social media because everybody puts that best picture the best face forward
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:23.700]   Aren't I having a great life and that's not even normal? That's that's
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.340]   I compare yourself to a lot of
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:31.460]   Kids and I see a lot of like tiktok and other social media videos that celebrate
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:33.780]   people who they're like just like
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:40.820]   I have ADHD. This is what I do. I think we're moving in that direction. Yeah, I think it's weird. Yeah
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:43.620]   Good to see because i'm not seeing that. Yeah
[01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:49.540]   Oh, maybe it's maybe again. It's part of my weird algorithm. They're like stacyly ex-boofy people
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:52.420]   And more tiktok and more tiktok
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:53:00.740]   Well, no, I take I take that back from an instagram standpoint instagram is doing much better with eliminating selfies and things like that to me
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.580]   um
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:08.500]   But it was a lot of the whole braggadocious time. I really don't like the influencer thing
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:12.980]   But I know we're getting I hope we're getting away from that because it's a stupid business model
[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:19.140]   Well, and frankly there's lots of influencers doing different things like I following a bunch of curly haired influencers
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:23.300]   Because I have curly hair and i'm like, oh, I will totally buy that thing. You said i love curly hair
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:25.300]   He's curly hair's the best hair
[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:27.140]   uh
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:32.740]   Our daughter is nothing's my wife my wife to let her go with the curls. Yeah, please we're all very happy. Yes
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:33.940]   But this is nothing new
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:38.660]   I mean magazines with photoshopped or retouched photos on the cover have been in the problem for years causing
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:43.620]   image issues and so forth. So this is nothing new but uh, yeah, I'm really glad
[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:46.260]   In fact, maybe in the long run this is what jeff's been saying
[01:53:46.260 --> 01:53:53.700]   Is this is going to be a positive trend because neuro diversity will be celebrated on social net media and people will feel a little bit like oh
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:57.860]   I guess I guess i'm not so weird. I think it happens and and
[01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:01.460]   Data boy has always been great about this talking about her own childhood
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:06.980]   Is it the internet allowed her to find that she wasn't the only person in the world like this?
[01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:08.100]   Yeah
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:11.460]   There wasn't western of normal it was just a question of finding others who shared
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:14.340]   her view of herself
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:18.820]   And and how valuable that was and and and how how saving that is
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:24.100]   And so to me that's one of the greatest things but the internet and facebook has screwed it up
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:29.540]   No doubt, but but what are the advantages of being able to find people like here?
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:33.140]   This is not echo chambers. It's being able to say i'm not alone
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:34.820]   and
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:38.260]   And to find people you can share with and that has tremendous value
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.740]   And this is why I extol
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:46.740]   The courage and value of sharing and being open is because you can't connect with somebody until you share that by yourself
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:52.980]   I would submit that we exist because of that especially back in the late 90s tech tv started
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:56.580]   You know, we made it cool to be geeky and and people would watch it
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:02.180]   I could hear from people all the time as teenagers who felt alone in their kind of passion for technology and geekiness
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:06.100]   And they found tech tv and they said oh this is great. I'm not alone
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:10.980]   So even geeks have felt ostracized a little less so these days because
[01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:13.700]   Technologies everywhere tell me leo
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:16.420]   Be honest now
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:19.860]   Were you really a geek? Oh, yeah high school. Oh, yeah
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:23.940]   I was like huge states. I was a little bit of a drama nerd. I wanted to be an actor
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:30.260]   Um, oh I can see that yeah, and I got in a radio because of that right that was the performing
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:33.780]   Part of it. So I then college I was in radio, but I was always
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:37.460]   I was a chess nerd
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:41.780]   Oh, wow. Okay. All right. All right sold and then I've all played a lot of tournaments. In fact
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:45.380]   The the day before my wedding I played in the us open
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:52.660]   Which my future wife was not crazy about but uh, no, I was very serious chess player
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:56.740]   And then I found computers and that that was transformative. That was though remember
[01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:02.580]   I'm old enough that that was the personal computers were only in my by the time I was in my early 20s
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:06.420]   Well, I got my first personal computer, but boy, that's a guy. I just donated
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:12.020]   I went to the magnificence I give them a plug but magnificent museum of printing in haverhill mass
[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:17.780]   I've been there a couple times now. Um, uh, frank roman. I was the founder of it. He just turned 80 years old
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:19.780]   He's he's a wonder of nature
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:25.780]   And they have a line of type there and and all these machines that I absolutely love and I wonder a line of type nerd
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:31.780]   That's what you are. I am a line of type. Sure. And so I just donated he said, you know, I'm looking for a uh,
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:36.580]   Osborne one and I have this out about a experience like jeff how much does it matter to you?
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:40.820]   Versus the good it will do for frank. So I donated my Osborne one and my morrow
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:47.860]   Yeah, those are the museum of printing in haverhill mass. No, the pivot was a piece of crap. Well, but we wanted one
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:51.300]   Yes, it was a cheap it was a cheap Osborne. That's why
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:54.420]   Uh, we had an Osborne for a while all the rubber had decayed
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:58.340]   We had it in our museum here in the the old studio, but all the rubber had decayed
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:02.740]   It was kind of falling apart. But boy when those came out. I wanted one so bad
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:06.980]   It has screen this literally this big and green and black
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:12.660]   But it came with words to our it came with all the apps you needed right words start on floppies because it had
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:16.740]   Two floppies and one for the program and one for the size of a sewing machine
[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:21.060]   Uh, you had to load the the the operating system and load the program
[01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:27.780]   It was doss. Yeah, and they cost me I think it was 1795. Yep. Was the retail cost of it
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:31.060]   Which I bought and then my printer I know it's like a Samsung foldable phone
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:36.340]   Yes, exactly exactly except that that was also the cost at the time of a Toyota Corolla
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:40.100]   But maybe that is a man. It was very expensive. It was very expensive
[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:42.580]   And then I bought a an impact printer
[01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:48.180]   Because editors wouldn't take the stock matrix crap. That was 2300. Those are so expensive
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:52.500]   I bought the first apple laser writer when it came out in '86. Oh my god
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:57.460]   I think and that was 3000 something like that was very expensive, but man was that cool
[01:57:57.940 --> 01:58:04.340]   I had a friend they were so expensive and so rare. I had a friend who made his living driving a van with a laser printer in it
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:10.980]   And a mac going around doing mobile desktop publishing for people people up in the vans and all right give me
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:14.100]   Let's call sharpie or not
[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:16.740]   Without that newsletter
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:22.740]   Google change floppy bring your floppies floppies got your floppies here bring your floppies
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:30.420]   Desktop publishing. I've got sans. I've got serif. I've got them all come on laser printed while you wait
[01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:36.820]   I got serif. I got serif. I got sans. I can do it all
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:43.460]   CNBC reported that google has been buying up land in northern san jose
[01:58:43.460 --> 01:58:49.780]   389 million dollars on what they plan to make a hardware
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:57.060]   Research and development center they call it midpoint campus because it's midpoint between google's mountain view headquarters in that
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:01.380]   Beautiful new mixed-use campus. They just built in san jose it'll have five office buildings
[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:05.220]   Uh that will serve as a hub for the hardware division including nest
[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:07.300]   smart home
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:09.300]   products
[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:10.180]   Um
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:17.620]   That's a that's you know important because it means google is committed to continuing in hardware. That's a serious business. Interesting. Yeah
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:24.740]   Did you hear anything about google buying or going into the old birchenstock building in the vato?
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:31.860]   Uh, yeah, that building which you and I drive by all the time. Mm-hmm is actually
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:37.380]   I've been around long enough to remember it isn't just it used to be a schoolbook

[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:46.500]   used to be the hooten mifflin building and then birchenstock bought it
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:52.260]   And it just shows you how times have changed print books sandals

[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:16.500]   If those crocs get a little smelly a little dirty just put them in the dishwasher run a regular cycle man. They are
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:19.300]   As a wiske
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:24.500]   Google sorry stacey google fiber ending tv service in Austin
[02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:33.620]   Oh, that's okay. Yeah, who cares and Atlanta and Atlanta, but they're still doing the internet and internet's going somewhere. I think someday
[02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:40.740]   Google we mentioned this earlier, but uh, this is the completion of the google changing things
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:46.180]   Uh on youtube and so forth. They're gonna restrict I think we've mentioned this before but they're gonna restrict
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.420]   um ad
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:50.500]   tracking for kids under 18
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:54.580]   Among the other things we didn't mention that one so i'll throw that one
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:57.140]   uh in there
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:58.660]   uh
[02:01:58.660 --> 02:02:01.620]   According to changes in ad targeting google also says
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:07.220]   Uh, it's expanding safeguards to stop age sensitive ad categories
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:12.660]   Whatever those are for being shown to teens teens under 16
[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:22.420]   Uh or will not be you can't add target them based on interests or activity only on age gender and location. Oh, well, that's a relief
[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:26.900]   Yeah
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:34.820]   New i would like for y'all to know that the crocs charms are called jibbitz jibbitz. Oh, thank you

[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:45.620]   How much how many how many uh lozah that you had to buy stacy for your daughter
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:50.100]   Oh, I haven't had to buy any I was just looking for something for you because if I could find you a printing press
[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:52.100]   I'm gonna do it. It's kind of interesting
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:54.580]   it's kind of an interesting choice
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:57.380]   of a name jibbitz because um
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:00.420]   you may remember that in the
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:04.900]   17th and 18th century jibbitz were any instrument of public execution
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:11.220]   Including guillotine executioners block impalement stake hanging gallows or related scaffold
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:13.940]   Yeah, but it's pronounced the same
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:16.900]   I didn't know that I always thought it was a gibbet. Maybe it's a gibbet
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:18.100]   jibbiting
[02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:23.940]   Is it a gift for a jiff jibbiting refers to the use of a gallows type structure from which dead or dying bodies of criminals were
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:28.900]   Hung on public display. Well, the show is certainly taking a friendly turn. No, no, no
[02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:33.220]   I'm trying to so the jibbet in your shoe is related to the jibbet
[02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:38.420]   They used to hang prisoners on so that you wouldn't commit crime now you hang it on your shoes
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:41.220]   So you don't commit grime
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:44.260]   Okay

[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:06.260]   Yeah, I guess that's not quite the same as a jibbitz right here
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:09.060]   jibbitz
[02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:13.780]   Desktop printing serif sand serif jibbitz
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:19.620]   Oh, look all these we still live of change log. I forget. Yeah. Yeah, I'm so sorry
[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:23.060]   Delighted by just having rocks
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:28.580]   Discursive. Yeah. Yeah, you should you're the one to complain jeff you meant you're the one who brought up your podiatrist
[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:34.180]   Yeah, I did it. I thought google is adding air quality info the nest hub and hub max
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:37.780]   That's just in time for a while
[02:04:38.420 --> 02:04:44.020]   Yeah, yeah, good stuff. I actually went out and bought two purple air sensors one indoors one outdoors last time
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:47.140]   So we were oh y'all are gonna love my pick this week
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:51.620]   Oh, I even made uh my own little web page
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:54.820]   For the air quality in my neighborhood
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:59.780]   So that I could quickly load this on my website and find out what the air quality is
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:05.220]   Nearby and in our home. You are such a nerd. Yeah home outside home inside
[02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:10.180]   Meadow school corona creek school. It seems like only schools in our area have it
[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:18.180]   But notice there's a nice uh confluence of all the numbers. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Good stuff. It's like a second double check
[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:23.780]   Google is rolling out now. Oh, I got to do this beta four for the pixel phone
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:28.580]   For the public beta. They had the developer edition rolled out yesterday. Now you can get beta
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:32.420]   For I guess we're getting close to uh android 12
[02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:38.820]   This is the platform stability release. So in other words
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:44.900]   Uh, they're now shifting their focus from bug fixes to polish
[02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:51.220]   platform stability milestone sees app facing behaviors and non sdk interface restrictions
[02:05:51.220 --> 02:05:55.060]   finalized api level 31 is locked
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:59.140]   We're in final compatibility testing getting close
[02:05:59.780 --> 02:06:01.780]   Let me just I've been using it on my pixel
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:04.020]   Let's see
[02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:09.460]   It's not you know, I do like the theming thing that the that's the only thing I can really see that's different
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:12.020]   Let me see if I have it
[02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:18.580]   Here I just did a system update. Yep system update available android 12 s pb 4 dot
[02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:22.260]   2 107 1 5 dot 0 1 1
[02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:26.340]   All right, I'll install it right now installing system update
[02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:32.340]   Uh google adds an interactive periodic table of the elements
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:36.180]   How many times have you wondered?
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:39.540]   What is the atomic number of lead?
[02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:45.460]   Uh, well now all you have to do is search and here you go
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:48.260]   This is from the um
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:52.100]   Art and serenments with google.com pb you're right very good
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:59.220]   Hup-a-bravo. This is exciting. Yes. There's there's some trivia about my various of the of the elements. Yeah
[02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:08.020]   So I own a book that is dedicated to the elements and I bought my daughter elements flashcards. The chemistry is so awesome. Yeah
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:13.780]   Um, that was one of the early iPad apps. It was so cool as elements in it. Oh, yeah
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:16.260]   Yeah
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:17.940]   Yeah, this is kind of neat. Thank you google
[02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:22.740]   But in the escape room, I actually had to use the molecular weight for lithium as part of my career
[02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:29.060]   How did you find it? Do you were you allowed to use a browser? There was a periodic table on the um, uh
[02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:35.220]   Board, but I remembered it from chemistry. We had to memorize. No, you remember the atomic weight of lithium
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:40.420]   Just lithium and like hydrogen and oxygen. I mean like just the basics
[02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:43.060]   What is I don't know you don't want not any of the
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:48.500]   You might remember the number like this number three because it's hydrogen and helium lithium
[02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:51.380]   but the atomic weight
[02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:54.420]   Atomic mass is 6.94
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:58.820]   Yeah, you know I have to say nine three. Well, that's close enough
[02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:05.620]   Wow not for the escape room. Oh you would not have escaped. What's the boiling point of lithium?
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:09.380]   I don't know the boiling one thousand three hundred thirty degrees
[02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:11.380]   Celsius
[02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:12.820]   That's hot
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:16.020]   It doesn't melt till 180. What's the boiling point of lead?
[02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:20.340]   Mmm, where is pb on this thing here?
[02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:21.540]   I
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:22.660]   There it is
[02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:24.980]   82 the boiling point of lead is
[02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:28.660]   1,749 degrees, but it will melt at 327
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:34.500]   That's why you could make lead soldiers on your stove as I have mentioned before and that's why that's why
[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:37.860]   Gutenberg used it. I got it. Oh because he could melt it
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:41.220]   Oh, of course, that's cool
[02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:44.100]   Oh, there's quite a
[02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:46.660]   It's hot says John
[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:50.740]   All right, where are we going?
[02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:53.220]   I'm going back through
[02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:56.260]   I think it's about done. Well, it is but
[02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:00.900]   There's also scooter X's change log. Oh, right. Yes
[02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:07.380]   His change log is quite good. I'm not coming. He is he is really good google home 2.42 ads
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:15.460]   Nest cam doorbell support and preps. I think this is exciting setting per device on dns
[02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:20.500]   and I guess when they say adt is what is that what is that support for
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:27.060]   Adt the alarm cable did a deal with adt for their gear and so now you can get
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:30.100]   Yes, it's part of yeah
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:36.180]   Uh, this is cool. So you can use google's public dns server instead of the routers provided dns
[02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:38.740]   for your device
[02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:42.820]   I guess my nest device is only yeah per device dns
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:45.380]   Hmm
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:50.660]   Don't be the advantage of that is that just to like a bit late lower latency prevent ads. I mean
[02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:55.940]   Yeah, it seems weird for dedicated devices. It's for google say hey, you know, you could just use
[02:09:55.940 --> 02:09:58.500]   Our dns then we know what you are up to
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:02.500]   Yeah, maybe okay
[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:05.380]   Anyway, lots of new features coming
[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:08.100]   to the google line
[02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:12.100]   This is the scooter x
[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:17.300]   Change log it's his voice for hearing you to be stuck in
[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:22.500]   Yeah, I don't know what I've met him, but I don't know what it sounds like. I can't remember
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.180]   What do you sound like scooter x?
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:29.220]   Yo tope for android now lets you skip video chapters with a two finger double tap
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:34.100]   Well, the name like scooter x you should sound like that. I know it probably sounds like rocky
[02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:37.220]   not that rocky
[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:41.780]   You know, uh, hillmary rock. I did not like the suicide squad movie, but
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:47.380]   Sylvester saloon plays a giant rubber shark and that's pretty fun
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:51.460]   Oh boy
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:57.620]   Okay, that is that is in our cue to watch though because she liked the original one and I told her the original movie was bad too
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:01.220]   It's not Mike. It's merely not my cup of tea
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:05.620]   Uh, that's all I'm saying here. Let me see if I can uh
[02:11:05.620 --> 02:11:09.300]   find you a little a little something to uh
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:12.740]   Get our show taken down
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:17.060]   Shark
[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:22.580]   I'm smart
[02:11:22.580 --> 02:11:26.260]   Jammel B says it's this great. He loved it a lot of people loved it
[02:11:26.260 --> 02:11:32.420]   It's not my cup of tea. I'm not a comic book nerd. I it didn't it just didn't resonate for me
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:34.820]   But you know, I think a lot of people enjoy it
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:37.780]   uh and that
[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:41.060]   Is scooter x is changel
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:46.500]   Well done scooter x
[02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:51.060]   One weakness
[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:55.940]   Just looking just looking at this google actually should have had this to change like google tv will now be
[02:11:56.420 --> 02:12:02.900]   On the new tcl six and five series tv's they're still going to do roku on some tv's but they've added google tv
[02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:08.180]   And actually that's pretty cool. I think that's a good thing. Are people trusting tcl televisions now?
[02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:10.820]   Do we not trust them?
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:12.900]   I thought at one point there were
[02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:21.700]   Uh controversial because of the whole china connection. Well, o s have an exploit. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure they're they're spying on us like every other
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:26.020]   Smart tv. That's why they're all righty then. Yeah, that's why they're smart
[02:12:26.580 --> 02:12:29.540]   Um, you know, yeah, yeah, I mean
[02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:34.420]   I like I like the tcl brand at least they put a lot of things out there that are
[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:40.340]   Friendly and they work the six series is everybody agrees fan
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:42.260]   Tastic
[02:12:42.260 --> 02:12:44.260]   uh 120 hertz 4k
[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:46.260]   Um
[02:12:46.260 --> 02:12:51.860]   It's and they also offer and it's inexpensive for big sizes and they also I think you're going to do an 8k
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:55.460]   Uh, if not already the soon man
[02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:59.540]   Yeah, here's a six series with google tv 65 inches
[02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:05.540]   1,299 if you don't have a big tv yet. It's mini led
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:12.500]   uses qled 4k uhd smart tv with google belt and belt and i'm not bad
[02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:17.700]   I got my mom. I got my mom two of them because that's the steel
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:21.220]   I have one in her bedroom one in her living room so that the chinese can see what she's up to
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:24.500]   Don't get back to you. Yeah, let me know
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:26.900]   uh
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:32.500]   I think unless you guys jeff i've been giving you some time to refer me to any line
[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:35.620]   Oh
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:37.620]   I'm about twitter
[02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:45.700]   twitter space is introduces co host feature twitter ai bias contest shows beauty figures hood wink the algorithm
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:50.740]   I'm going to save this one for a pic because this looks pretty cool. Well, we could do it now
[02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:53.300]   tweet shelf who found this
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:55.300]   That's
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:14:02.980]   Said on on I put it in there. Um, I forget who was on twitter said. Oh, I miss nuzzled terribly, but tweet shelf is almost there
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:07.460]   So the the whole idea of nuzzle was it would go through your
[02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:11.060]   Uh, your tweets the people you follow and give you
[02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:15.940]   News based on what your friends were tweeting and friends of friends were tweeting and so forth
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:20.180]   This is doing the same thing. I just logged in so it's it's actually going through all my uh
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:24.340]   My feed right now and building it says this might take a few minutes
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:30.020]   There's also a pro version so I I couldn't get like the links off my lists which I value
[02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:35.060]   Oh, I would love to have the list and my book history. Yeah list. So what is the uh,
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:37.300]   599 a month is a little pricey
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:40.340]   God everything costs money these days
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:45.780]   Yep, blacks because the original benefit or the original internet was not tenable
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:49.060]   If you don't want to give up our data this information is free
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:55.140]   You can get that anywhere everywhere on some but if you would like to pay seven dollars a month
[02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:57.300]   We wouldn't turn it down
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:01.940]   And being a member of club very good cause is really a good thing
[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:06.580]   Club to it is uh, something we set up because people told us they didn't want to hear any more ads
[02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:10.500]   And they want to hear the tracking and then advertisers told us they didn't want to buy any more ads
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:14.980]   So it was a perfect time to introduce an ad free version of our shows
[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:17.540]   But you know what when there's no ads in the shows
[02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:24.900]   There's no money to be made so we're you know, I mean it costs us a lot of money to run this studio and that we 20 employees etc
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:25.300]   etc
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:27.860]   So we set up club to it as a way to support twit
[02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:31.460]   Uh, which should make you feel great sure don't make makes us feel great
[02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:34.740]   But you also get ad free versions of all of our shows audio and video
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:39.060]   You get access to our fantastic discord, which is a heck of a lot of fun
[02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:41.220]   And you get twit plus
[02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:46.900]   Content that no one else gets in a special feed just for you things like pre-show
[02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:51.380]   Conversations that gives fizz the untitled Linux show and a whole lot more
[02:15:51.380 --> 02:15:53.860]   Um
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:56.740]   And we'll have a big announcement for the club soon
[02:15:56.740 --> 02:15:59.620]   Oh
[02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:02.420]   Oh
[02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:05.220]   But I won't say anything it's I don't know if it's uh public yet
[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:07.140]   Uh
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:08.420]   Okay
[02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:14.020]   Oh, here's my stories view my stories. Welcome back. So this is tweet shelf.com. This is the free version
[02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:20.580]   That's you know, I think uh, I'm thrilled because I really miss nuzzle. It's a little more bare bones and nuzzle
[02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:23.540]   But it's looks more like a feed, which is nice
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:27.380]   This is good and it has a link to the tweets
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:31.300]   All the stories is articles websites
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:34.180]   Books, I kind of like this
[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:43.220]   So it looks like your rs. Oh school rss reader. It's like sumi.news. Yeah, it is it is basically that's what the premise of nuzzle was
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:48.820]   Is kind of like a feed crude derived from your twitter. This is much more like a real rss feed. I like this
[02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:51.540]   Oh
[02:16:51.540 --> 02:16:53.940]   I might have to go premium on yeah
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:17:01.620]   Well, we we saved you for buying a $2,000 phone today. So you can afford it. Yeah at that price. I can afford 10 years of this
[02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:06.180]   All right, let's uh, hold on hold on hold on
[02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:09.380]   The twitter ai one. I thought that was a
[02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:15.620]   A good kudos for okay twitter. Let me finish though. Uh, I forgot to say if you wanted
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:20.580]   I forgot the payoff if you want a join club twit twit
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:25.380]   Pluthed out there figured out waiting how to hear this skimmish take my money
[02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:28.900]   Twit. We really appreciate it. Actually. We have some great members
[02:17:28.900 --> 02:17:33.780]   I said I don't know what the number is so far, but it's uh, I think it's around three or four thousand and I really
[02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:38.340]   It's wonderful to have you all thank you all. Thank you. I'm really thank you every one of you bless you
[02:17:38.980 --> 02:17:40.980]   You keep this show afloat
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:44.820]   Uh, because we only had one ad so that gave you some idea
[02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:51.380]   twitter ai bias contest shows beauty filters hood wink the algorithm
[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:54.180]   What does that mean and explain?
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:57.780]   Well, they put on a contest to um
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:04.740]   See how images and things are are being pushed into twitter feed even down to how twitter crops
[02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:07.300]   some some images out and
[02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:10.340]   They did this contest because
[02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:15.380]   They wanted to make their ai better and two people figured out. Okay. This is what's happening
[02:18:15.380 --> 02:18:18.740]   And this is why this is happening and coo in twitter said, you know what?
[02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:22.900]   Thank you. We need to fix this and get this better and get people a better
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:27.700]   twitter from an image standpoint twitter was it got a little trouble earlier this year because
[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:32.980]   Uh people found out it's cropping at algorithm favorite images of white people over black people
[02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:40.580]   That's not a good album or age or people that were older was cropping out older people. Yeah, so
[02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:45.780]   But wait tell me what I never understood. Where is it cropping that not being a
[02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:51.940]   It's it's in the it's in the app. So you don't see the whole photo. They just crop what it thinks is
[02:18:51.940 --> 02:18:56.340]   Right and it tries to find the most important part. Uh, which is
[02:18:56.980 --> 02:19:03.060]   Find from the ai standpoint to try to you know, make the subject stand out in it in the image
[02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:04.820]   But at the same time. Oh, I see
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:08.580]   So here's an example. I'm looking at a tweet
[02:19:08.580 --> 02:19:12.260]   And the picture isn't the whole picture. This is when I click on the picture
[02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:18.580]   I get the much more of the picture, but they've decided to center it on on that I get people people
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:24.740]   Yeah, yeah, that that'd be my bet is that's going and if and white people over black people
[02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:30.660]   Which is not so good and effect over women. Yeah, in fact, uh, this researcher bogged on uh, collin itch
[02:19:30.660 --> 02:19:36.980]   Found lighter skinned younger and slimmer of variations. They post they posted
[02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:41.220]   the same photo in a variety of different ways to see
[02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:44.100]   Uh
[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:50.180]   How it would be cropped if you if you got skinnier lighter and younger it increased your
[02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:56.340]   Your salient score by 35 28 and 29 respect percent respectively
[02:19:56.340 --> 02:19:59.140]   So big difference, you know
[02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:06.660]   I just like the fact that we we we've talked about ai and the bias and ai for the last year and a half and
[02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:11.540]   Said these these companies. They need to do better and they need to hire people that look more like
[02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:12.820]   me
[02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:17.220]   Um to help get this better and here's twitter saying, you know what we got to get this right
[02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:21.860]   So how about someone help us out and thank you for helping us out. Let's get this in action
[02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:24.340]   Yeah, and credit to twitter because they
[02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:28.180]   Yeah, sponsor the contest. The prize was $3,500. This is like a body bounty
[02:20:28.180 --> 02:20:31.780]   Yeah, called it a body for algorithmic bias. That's good for them
[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:35.780]   And uh one by a researcher from switzerland
[02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:39.220]   That is a good one. Thank you aunt
[02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:43.700]   Thank you didn't know that's what you meant or I would have gone straight to it
[02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:47.140]   He said twitter ai
[02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:49.140]   Oh, god
[02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:51.140]   Twitter
[02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:54.420]   And now we're gonna take a break and come back with uh picks of the week
[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:56.420]   next
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:21:03.380]   Stacey hickenbotham kicks off our picks of the week as she always does with something we like to call stacey's thing
[02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:10.740]   Okay, so the thing I have for you is the 3m fill treat air filters
[02:21:11.380 --> 02:21:15.940]   I got two of them and since we were talking about air quality sensors, I thought this was a fun
[02:21:15.940 --> 02:21:18.820]   device um
[02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:21.780]   I can take you to show it to you. I have two versions
[02:21:21.780 --> 02:21:26.900]   I have a big version that's designed for like a big room and then I have a smaller version that is designed for like a
[02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:35.300]   Like a bedroom fill rate. Um, and f i l t r e t e fill rate. Yes. And so it's Wi-Fi connected. Here's the app
[02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:37.780]   Oh a Wi-Fi connected air filter
[02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:44.340]   Yeah, so what it's telling me is it's telling me two things one. I can just go in and i'm like
[02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:49.060]   Oh, this is it's not on right now. Uh, but it's telling me my air quality is
[02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:52.740]   Really good right now in my family room and it tells me my filter life
[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:58.180]   Yeah, I should compare this timers. I should compare this to the purple
[02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:04.180]   So in this is where it gets fun. I can also add my outdoor. So right here
[02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:09.780]   It's taking generic a qi's from the area, but I can add a purple sensor
[02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:17.460]   To this app and then it'll just pull directly from my purple sensor to tell me exactly what the air is outside my home. That is so cool
[02:22:17.460 --> 02:22:20.820]   And so this is
[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:25.060]   Again as we head into wildfire, I'm really interested to see what happens because right now
[02:22:25.060 --> 02:22:30.980]   It's clear that the filter is degrading by one percentage point each day. It's kind of nice to know that. Yeah
[02:22:30.980 --> 02:22:33.940]   You just guessed normally
[02:22:34.660 --> 02:22:37.460]   Well, you usually it'll it'll tell you at some point
[02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:42.580]   Um, and it'll give you your actual parts per million. Let's see pull this back some
[02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:49.060]   I don't know if you can see that it's the 2.5 and it's nice. It's parts per million for 2.5
[02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:54.740]   Micron particles 10 micron particles. So they've got a little chip in there
[02:22:54.740 --> 02:22:57.860]   That's pretty neat. Yes
[02:22:57.860 --> 02:23:02.740]   It's tracking your particulates what it isn't tracking though is vocs
[02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:10.260]   So if you're familiar with air quality monitors, there's like the aware that tracks carbon dioxide and vocs. This does not do that
[02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:17.300]   This particular one for their air quality index they are giving us goes from zero to
[02:23:17.300 --> 02:23:20.420]   I want to say like 200 and something
[02:23:20.420 --> 02:23:26.180]   Um, this is great. I need to order filters. So I'm going to order these. That's really are they much more expensive
[02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:34.020]   You would ask that question, which is a totally I can't find a price on the website
[02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:38.980]   They just send you here. I'll click a link and I probably send me to hold on. I'm sorry. I'm like
[02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:41.780]   smart mpr
[02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:44.260]   they
[02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:46.420]   Oh, that's the filters. I want the
[02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:49.940]   Pick your size. Oh my gosh air purifiers. Here we go
[02:23:49.940 --> 02:23:54.500]   I'm going to get a 20 by 20, which is pretty darn big. In fact, it's bigger than mine
[02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:57.300]   And let's see best buy has them in stock
[02:23:58.180 --> 02:24:00.180]   for
[02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:06.740]   Oh, lord, it's always so many clicks 21.99. That's not bad. I mean, I'm sure that's more than a
[02:24:06.740 --> 02:24:08.980]   non smart
[02:24:08.980 --> 02:24:10.980]   Filter would be but still
[02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:14.100]   It's not through the roots not 1799
[02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:23.380]   Oh my god. I can't get to the price. This is crazy. Oh, I got one 21.99 for the 20 by 20 history. Yeah, you have the ladies menu
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:28.580]   with the ladies menu. Oh, that's the ladies menu
[02:24:28.580 --> 02:24:35.620]   Oh, that's the menu that give to women with no prices on it. Yes, is anybody still that's hysterical
[02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:40.340]   I've never seen that do they do not actually see that. Oh, I was I used to see it. Yeah, really
[02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:42.420]   Wow
[02:24:42.420 --> 02:24:44.420]   New York ladies menu
[02:24:44.420 --> 02:24:46.500]   Oh, man
[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:50.740]   Oh, don't get it on Amazon same one on Amazon is 43 98
[02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:54.900]   So shop around kids you can be paying twice
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:25:02.100]   I feel like that is not the cost of this. I'm gonna just do best by said 21.99. Let's see what Walmart
[02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:06.020]   This got to be for the filter not the wall mart 1650
[02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:09.060]   wait, that is
[02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:11.140]   That has to be for
[02:25:11.140 --> 02:25:16.900]   The filters what else is there not the purifier? It's a purifier
[02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:20.340]   Oh, I thought you were talking about the filtreat filters for your air conditioning
[02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:22.900]   Which do the same thing by the way
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:32.100]   They they have a chip in that one for two capable. No these this this does too. See it's got an app and everything
[02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:40.980]   Oh, it's an air filter for your you know, straight in Stacy your your furnace filter
[02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:48.260]   No, filtreat is or 3m is frustrating Stacy. I'm just trying to okay. The purifier is like 80 bucks
[02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:52.980]   So they have an air purifier as well, but they also you can buy these
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:57.780]   Inserts as you know you change when you have filter furnaces you have filters for the intake
[02:25:57.780 --> 02:26:04.100]   Yeah, and you can change those but you could get these instead and it has a sensor in it and it would tell you
[02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:07.060]   How does it get the power to tell you?
[02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:08.420]   magic
[02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:10.740]   There's a there's a bluetooth sensor in the
[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:17.700]   It's a battery powered bluetooth sensor. They're only designed to last for three months. Oh, so they're not worried
[02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:21.380]   There's battery in it interesting
[02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:25.140]   So then you're supposed to land
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:27.780]   Cycle it and obsolescence with it
[02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:35.300]   Well, it's it's a filter y'all. That's one of the things like three m's filters. They do their particulate filtration by
[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:37.220]   hydro
[02:26:37.220 --> 02:26:42.100]   Statically charging it or something. So over time the the charge dissipates
[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:44.820]   I don't know if it dissipates at a rate of
[02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:49.460]   1% of the overall efficacy per day like they seem to indicate but
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:55.460]   Yeah, anyway, that's a terrible pick because I don't know how much it costs and I'm very fresh to myself
[02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:58.420]   I don't know but we found the filters, which is pretty cool
[02:26:58.420 --> 02:27:06.340]   So this is a good example of twitter
[02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:09.140]   bias in the clapping algorithm
[02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:13.460]   Here's a a tweet of 90s audition polaroids from casting director
[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:19.540]   It features juliet lewis vince von jason priestly, but oh my there's benicio del toro
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:22.740]   Elijah wood ben stiller cropped way out of that
[02:27:22.740 --> 02:27:25.460]   So I think there's a ben stiller filter
[02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:29.940]   That's gonna say those those are all white folks though. Now they are all white folks
[02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:32.980]   Billy bob look at billy bob
[02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:34.980]   Man, woody harrelson
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:40.900]   Anyway, okay. I'm sorry. Thank you stacey. That was really interesting. Yeah, sorry
[02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:43.060]   I
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:47.220]   Should have gone with my other pick I feel bad now
[02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:51.220]   I was excited by the earlier filter
[02:27:51.220 --> 02:27:55.060]   I didn't we're going to show the purifiers because I showed the filters
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:28:01.780]   Here's the purifiers and we'll just edit that in because leo did it wrong. Yeah, those are the ones that i'm testing
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:04.740]   Yeah, and which I can't find them in their pricing
[02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:07.460]   Well, you got to go to where to buy
[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:09.860]   And then you got to say by now
[02:28:10.820 --> 02:28:12.820]   And then you get the ladies menu
[02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:18.820]   251. All right, that's that makes more sense. Yes, there you go. Not $16
[02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:23.220]   Well, yeah, would you I was like no, I love it. You got the ladies
[02:28:23.220 --> 02:28:31.300]   What is that like you get that at 21 right at the stork club? I mean, I don't I'm sorry the
[02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:33.780]   French find places. Yeah, yeah fancy
[02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:38.900]   Watch mr. No menu jeff javis. You're numero
[02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:42.740]   Amen. This is this is oh
[02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:48.260]   Completely nonsensical, but I what I loved it. I saw the headline
[02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:50.900]   I jumped on it. I love this not the kind of the same reaction
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:56.260]   Pompeii's fast food joint on earth in 2019 opens to public
[02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:59.300]   And did you see what they're serving?
[02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:03.380]   Yeah, I'm thinking we can get this stuff. I think we're doing
[02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:06.180]   So they found um, this is 2019 story
[02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:08.180]   We've seen it, but they're gonna open it so people can go to it
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:09.940]   Which is really neat because it has pictures of chickens
[02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:12.820]   They're gonna they're gonna serve the the weird food
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:15.380]   No, they're not
[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:19.220]   Molten chocolate
[02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:25.220]   Do it what a great business they but no, they're just gonna open it so you can see it
[02:29:25.220 --> 02:29:27.620]   But yes, they found
[02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:32.100]   Remnants of duck bones pigs goats fish and snails and earth-aware pots
[02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:35.460]   The researchers believe the world edition of the menu was a type of paella
[02:29:35.460 --> 02:29:38.020]   Dozens of
[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:39.780]   Thermopolia
[02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:44.820]   Have been found through the park to snack bars were mostly used by poor residents of ancient pombe
[02:29:44.820 --> 02:29:47.060]   Who rarely had a kitchen in their homes?
[02:29:47.060 --> 02:29:52.660]   Typical menus included coarse bread with salty fish baked cheese lentils and spicy wine
[02:29:52.660 --> 02:29:58.660]   I think that sounds quite nice doesn't sound bad at all. Not sure. I'm peppy. Please too. Yeah, it's Italy
[02:29:59.060 --> 02:30:06.660]   So the because the pictures on the counters were so vivid they they hypothesized that that was a menu for the illiterate
[02:30:06.660 --> 02:30:13.780]   Customers or just decorations are nice decorations for a restaurant. Yeah, it's kind of cool. Yeah
[02:30:13.780 --> 02:30:15.620]   Yeah
[02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:19.540]   Thank you, Jeff has nothing to do with google has nothing to do with technology. No, but
[02:30:19.540 --> 02:30:22.820]   We talked about this shit. Honestly. This show has nothing to do with google. So
[02:30:22.820 --> 02:30:28.420]   We talk about food all the time. What are you talking about? They sold waffles. It would be on brand. We could call this
[02:30:28.980 --> 02:30:32.100]   Not your Pepe hour. They see the waffler
[02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:35.380]   Anthony
[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:38.820]   Would you like to do a pic?
[02:30:38.820 --> 02:30:48.100]   My pic uh shout out to adobe as they're trying to um recognize some photographers out there and giving them some some
[02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:51.380]   uh a little bit of press in their playing as they
[02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:54.340]   Brand them their rise and stars of photography
[02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:59.860]   And they featured a couple different people from around the world and if you click on their instagram accounts
[02:30:59.860 --> 02:31:05.460]   They're not big accounts, but they're just as talented and I just wanted to say yeah kudos
[02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:12.340]   Y'all don't be for doing that because there's so many good photographers after they don't get recognized, but yeah
[02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:16.820]   Yeah, this is um pretty good list and thank you biscuit for agreeing
[02:31:16.820 --> 02:31:21.780]   You woke up
[02:31:21.860 --> 02:31:27.300]   Oh, that was kylo that was a sleep. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. No, that's that's biscuit. That's the the tiny bark
[02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:32.260]   Yeah, uh next I just thought I'd have some fun and just say that my amazon
[02:31:32.260 --> 02:31:35.860]   Drivers bet it in yours. So I put a little link in there of
[02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:41.860]   A recent amazon you really you got one of these cameras and you now post in video all the time
[02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:45.060]   From your driveway cam. It's hysterical
[02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:50.660]   Here's your amazon driver on wheelies wheelies on wheelies
[02:31:51.540 --> 02:31:53.540]   That's pretty cool
[02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:57.460]   There's also one. I don't know where you posted it of you walking out topless
[02:31:57.460 --> 02:32:03.380]   Oh, yeah, that's on instagram. Is that to show your is that to show your man lee physique?
[02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:05.380]   Uh
[02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:07.380]   No, not quite
