[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. I'm back. Jeff and Gene here here in Newcomb as well to talk about the latest litigation in Europe in Australia.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Try to shut Google down. We'll also talk about the UN taking over regulation of the internet. New features for Android. Yes, now with December. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   This is Twig. This week in Google. Episode 174. Recorded November 28th, 2012. Reg A. Jeff.

[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Yes, I'm back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   But I do thank our great hosts for struggling through without me.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you for hosting while I was gone. Gina deserves all of the kudos. Gina did a spectacular job and heavier looking than I did.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   But you did as well. Am I wrong? Yeah, we both did. You both did.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We shared this with our Kumbaya culture of Twig. We shared the Gina suggestion. We shared the hosting.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   That's good. I like it. Did you use git to keep track of the notes? That would have been cool. Yeah. A little code sharing. Gina is at Smarterweird.org. That's where she blocked. She's also the author of Think Up and founding editor at Life Hacker.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Jeff is of course a blogger at Buzzmachine.com, the author of Public Parts and a professor of journalism at the City University of New York also with us Aaron Nukem who bidet slaves at Oracle.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But is also the host of a great open source podcast. That's the best darn open source show. No, that's something else. That darn open source show.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   The open source show. The source show.org. I'm close. I'm working on it. Nice to have you back. Thank you. We were in here earlier for TNT. I guess this is my Twitter. I was here for Floss Weekly this morning. That's right. Wednesday's Floss Weekly.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yeah. And so then I stuck around for TNT. I was just about to leave. Chad says, "Yes." He got the big book. And he said, "Aww." Aaron came from Sudden. I said, "Absolutely, I'll stay." Did you see our interview with Jonathan Schwartz? Oh, no, I missed it.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   He actually is really good. He gets a lot of flack. But if you've actually talked to him or if you know him, he's actually really, really good.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   We always liked it when he was CEO of Oracle because he was always outspoken and said stuff. In fact, the way he left Oracle was a haiku on Twitter. Yeah, exactly. It was very funny.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Exactly. But he talked about the patent stuff a little bit. It's pretty interesting. Was that on triangulation? Yeah.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Oh, so you'll back a couple episodes. Check it out if you missed it because I bet that was really good. He's a good talker, a very smart guy.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I think he did the best he could to keep son of float given. He talked a lot about what happened at Son and why ultimately they had to sell and how hard they worked to find the right buyer and so forth.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   So, yeah, that was fun. Anyway, and is Java your big stuff? What do you work on there at the Oracle? Mostly storage. Storage. Yep.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Storage for the cloud, storage for virtual environments, big data, things like that. ZFS.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yep. ZFS. That's what I tell them around. I know you came in on Floss Weekly and talked about ZFS.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   That was my first appearance, I think, on the Twitter. The file system that goes with... Does it go with this? Does it still? I mean, is there even a Solaris anymore?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. In fact, well, no, there's actually Solaris is still being developed quite heavily. And Spark is still around.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Okay. Spark anniversary down at the Computer History Museum, which was really fun. That's the original workstation from Son. Not the original, but it's a workstation from Son.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Yeah, it's a server now, but sorry, that was a workstation. And of course, all the old guys were there. Oh, yeah, I call them the old guys about the same age, probably.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Talking about the old guys now. The old guys now. The old guys now. But Bill Joy and all those folks talking about the development of the Spark platform. It was really fun.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I really like ZFS. It's a very modern file system as opposed to the ones that we are saddled with on both Windows and Macintosh and to a lesser degree on Linux.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And I would love to see it more widespread for a while. Didn't Apple say they were going to do ZFS? They did. And then they backed out. I mean, I don't know what happened there, but you can still run it on BSD. If you're interested, I'm running it right now in free BSD. I just set up a free BSD system at home.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   So were you running on this Mac? I am not. This is Ubuntu for the time being. But I actually switched from Ubuntu server at home to free BSD just to try it out.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   BSD is in many ways a true Unix. It's really probably. It is. It's a little bit more similar to a Unix system. Yep. Yeah. There's more attention. Anyway, we digress. We do because this shows about Google.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   But I like a little geek tuck thrown in on the side there. So I guess we should probably start with a changelog since I'm sure there's all sorts of exciting new developments in Google Land.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, we like trumpets. We give you the trumpets. The Google change log.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Now, Gina Travani with the latest features from Google.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Biggest change this week is that Google Tuesday announced that you can insert Google Drive files into your Gmail up to 10 gigabytes. Yeah. Yeah, which is a lot.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's just very large files. So in your Gmail compose window in the attachment area where you detach a file. There's a new button that says insert files using drive.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   So you can send giant files. So they're really pushing on Drive wanting you to store store big files and share them through Gmail now.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I wonder how this impacts the file sharing services like our sponsor share file. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Maybe 10 gigabytes is pretty darn big. Throwing down the gauntlet for sure. For sure. Free. Free. Exactly. Exactly.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   We talked last week. I think about how the jelly bean update, the new version of jelly bean had a little bug in it where the month of December was missing and the people's app people app.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   So if you want to the people app and you tried to enter a date, there just wasn't a December. November, January. November to January. Google is returning the month of December to jelly bean and a 4.2.1 over the air update.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I just got mine on the Nexus 7 and I believe it's coming to the other Nexus devices which also got that jelly bean update. Have you guys gotten this update? I probably have. I haven't looked at my Nexus 7.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   No, I haven't got it on my 7 or my brand new thanks to you. I opened it next is for. But wait a minute. Is the four have the same problem? Yeah, this is all the all devices that jelly bean.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Wait a minute. That's so how would that be? So I here's my Galaxy Note 2. This is running jelly bean. Oh, I did get an update from Samsung recently.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   So open the P is it the four dot one jelly bean or the four dot two jelly beans? Yeah, there's two jelly beans. There's four dot one and two. And it's only the four two that's the problem. Right. And the four two is on the Nexus 7, the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 10, the Nexus 4. So it's so I mean truthfully not a lot of devices had the new jelly beans so they didn't have this problem.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   But it was kind of kind of a funny. It's a great headline. It's a great taking taking a page from Apple's book, Google downgrades and removes features taking December out of jelly bean.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Screwed. That's a now you're a programmer. That's a weird bug. How would that why would that happen? Is this somebody writing a ray and just leave it out?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I cannot. I honestly cannot imagine how that would happen. I mean, normally you would iterate through a list of months, you know, kind of a pre populated list of months. I mean, generally not going to program or typing out the months, right? And like forget December.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   So I must be what happened. Yeah, there's must be a line of code somewhere. There's an array. Someone put a comment in front of a line of code where they shouldn't have. And then that's maybe they could.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   They said zero to 11 instead of zero to 10 instead of zero. That would make sense. That would make sense. This is the 12 months. Yeah, right. The 12 month they might have just forgotten.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   So that update is going out and I just I just confirmed to my next seven that December is now back in the people out. That makes perfect sense of that then it because you don't cut hard code that the names of the month.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   But you might hard code, but you would hard code how many months they're hard, but who's checking this stuff? Well, you'd think that would have been caught. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's fascinating that their test. We didn't catch this, that their QA. I mean, you know, this is a really big box. So it's kind of funny that it got out there. So here's what the change. The actual change log says, according to Biggity Bong in the chat room. Quote, revert number picker should adjust men and Max when displayed values are set. AKA Santa is back.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It was a number picker. It was a number picker. It's been a max. Yeah, that sounds like somebody cut the ray off one month too soon.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The plus of occasion of everything continues a pace. This time it's in Google Play. Google Play reviews. Now when you leave a review on Google, the Google Play Store, it prompts you to use your Google Plus account and use your full name.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And your prior reviews will just be from a Google user. And the new next new reviews will now have your picture next to it. Right. So your picture and your full name go next to your Google Play Store.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I don't think that's a bad thing. I know some people said, well, we should be able to review. We should be able to pan things anonymously. But that's, I think that having your picture and name really makes put you on the spot to be honest.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   As a developer, I'm thrilled. Yeah. Well, exactly. No more tried by trolls reviews. Yeah. I mean, I can get to something. I can contact someone. I'll know who they are.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Yeah. Oh, that could be bad. See, no. Okay. Now there's the other side of it though. So let's say you get a piece of junk software. You're at a bad review and the developer harasses you.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Well, I'm not harasses. I just, you know, you would do that. But some crazed developer.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And might. But Gina certainly would not. No. But so, no, I wouldn't. I'm not accusing you of doing that. But understand. Yeah. No, I totally understand. I think it's, I think it's a good thing. Yeah. Look, if you're going to post in public something about something,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   especially if it's strong opinion, I like the idea of kind of owning a word and at least giving the developer. The Play Store has some other tools for developers to respond to reviews.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   But I think generally it's a good thing. Yeah. Just don't ever give a bad review of a John McCaffee software.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Google Maps is now giving out profile badges to helpful community members. There's that map maker tool that let people report errors in Google Maps.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Google Maps is just, it just announced that they're going to set up kind of a reward system. So the people who get the most edits get kind of badges to show off that they've, that they've contributed back to.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   It's so cool. Which is cool. I want to see more of this. I want to see more of this sort of gamifying contributing back to the system and making it better, you know, kind of for everyone.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And we talked about this a little bit last week with when we talked about Ingress. Yeah. And so I'm looking in here in my area.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   There are a number of things have closed or gone away. And so people will fix that, you know, establish working hours added, phone deleted, address changed geometry change.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   So now you'll get a little, can you use that on your Google Plus profile? I wonder where this shows up. It must show up on your, let's see.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   You get like a special little map maker badge. I like it. I like it too.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   I would be great if it showed up on your Google Plus profile. At the very least it shows up in them to the other map makers.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Neat. Yeah.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   After Sandy, I wanted to get our neighbors together because we asked her to do a group buy of a whole house generators, among other things.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   And so I use the new service next door.com, which sounds neat because you can delineate what your neighborhood is, but then they yelled at me and said my neighbor wasn't big enough.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And the next thing that happened was that they had all kinds of addresses. This is a 40 year old development. They didn't have any addresses in there.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And what's amazing was they didn't have the structure to let us fix it. We had to appeal on every address to get them to fix it, which just shows the different way to think.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   If you're really in platform think, you make something and you realize people are going to make it better with you. If you're like Microsoft, you say, no, no, no, we control that.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Yeah, I've used that service to next door and I thought the same thing. I thought it should be, you know, really open for people. Some things were.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   But I agree. I think it should have been. It could be a great service if you were allowed to go in and do some more things, but it is. It's kind of tightly controlled.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And I don't know whether that's because of privacy concerns or.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   No, I think it's just the map data they had. And I said, listen, you know, these these addresses are on Google Maps.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Yeah. Hello. Yeah. But but thinking that way and that's where Google just culturally shows the difference is that it is that it's opening up those opportunities to fix things.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And then it's rewarding people for doing it, which just shows a different attitude from my colleagues in media.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Mm hmm. Those old timers in media. You know, nothing off our lawn because it doesn't exist.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Last change log item. You can now edit sheets, Google sheets on the go on your iPad, iOS device or Android device. You can edit Google Docs, but Google sheets, which is their Google Spreadsheets project.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Product are now editable as well. Every time I think I hear that, I think you're going to get the stains out of them and then set them out to dry.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I know Google sheets does hang out the sheets. You can edit your sheets right on the line up your view.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Well, if you're crazy like me and you have a holiday spreadsheet going, you can.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   No. Yeah, but not for gifts for the meal. For the meal.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Well, that's even worse. Jesus, menu planning in the spreadsheet.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I saw somebody who had a spreadsheet for for a seating plan at the wedding.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   This is the thing. My mom makes a seven course fish dinner, which is a traditional kind of Sicilian Christmas Eve dinner.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And she had it all in her head. Oh, wow.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And she's getting older now. My sister and I kind of wanted to take over. So last year we spent the whole like time sort of and my mom has like the whole schedule in her head too.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   You know, like when you stuff the clams and when you, you know, shell the shrimp and all this stuff, right? So we actually we made a Google spreadsheet.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So I love the Italian. Oh, I am. I think that's so cool. I just love that. Man. So it's in a spreadsheet.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   It is. It's a spreadsheet. I thought maybe you had done a Google poll.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Who's going to bring one? I mean, there's a lot of applications for this.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   He uses Google Maps and Street View for the dining room table. There's an ad. There's a Google ad in here for sure.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Yeah. And that's all I got for the change log. The change log is now complete.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I think that's just like TNT is bleeding over into this show.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I'm so jealous. You got you got posters. Gina has an intro on an outro. We got posters for you.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Isn't Jeff on the posters? No, I wasn't in the posters. No, I think so. How do you get left out?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I wasn't every host. Even my dog is in the posters. I know. What do you think? How about it? I think it makes me feel.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Huh? What is this? What posters? You know, the posters. The posters from what's his name?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   D Martin? What is his name? Let me see if I can find them. It's all really nice.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Oh, it's really nice. Give me a chat room. You got a link to the posters. They're on Google+.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   We have a graphic artist who... MD-T-A-U-K. Oh, that's a common name. It turns out.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Search Google+ for that. Huh? I didn't mean to get off on this.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   No, I want to show... She hasn't seen her poster. Martin Anderson is his name.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Let's see, Martin. I'm going to go look through his posters. He's actually doing other people.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   There's a Tic-Tic-Tic-Tic-Bartolo. Look at that. Can you see that? Can you see my dog?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   There we go. There we go. Nice Tic-Tic-Tic-Bartolo. There's my dog.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   There's some guy named Javier, but nobody named Jeff Jarvis. I'm sorry.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   There's Scott Wilkinson. Oh, cute. Oh, yeah. He did a little bit better.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   These are great. He just has some technique. They look like they're almost like the silk-screened letterpress.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   What is the technique? Andrew Maine? Is there a gimp filter for this? Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Maybe he's just pushing a button. I don't know. I think he's pretty good, actually.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Yeah, I do too. Yeah, look at that. That's him. That's him, yeah.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Now, if I go far enough down, I didn't realize he was doing so many now.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   This is somebody in our chat room. And none for us.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   But there is one with all of the Twitch hosts except, apparently Jeff Jarvis.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Alex Gumpel. I thought that was good. Our Flowmaster Studio Engineer. Looking sharp in his Tic-Sita.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   He rented that once, but he's got a lot of mileage. Tony Wang, edit this out.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Some guy with a horse. Ozzie is very cute. Yeah, I thought Ozzie's was great.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Anyway, thank you, Martin. And just... Yeah, thank you a lot, Martin.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   If you could just throw one in for Jeff.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Let's get a good shot of Jeff. He's not pink today.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Let's get a good shot of... Okay, ready? Freeze.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Nice.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Okay. Wait, wait, wait for it.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   And bam, bam. We got it. Okay, there we go.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Now Martin has got... That was good. Martin has got it and he will be, I'm sure, soon offering that for us.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And there's a lot of... I saw the comments on those. A lot of people want to order them.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I want to order them. He's sending me the originals, the Raws.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   That's great. The one of me... Okay, actually Jeff, I just want to point out that you not getting one isn't so bad.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   It could look like that.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   I look angry about something. It says, "King Leo."
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I don't know, Tony Soprano, that's what just leaves to mind there. Do I actually look like that?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Maybe that's just me.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Anyway, for those listening on audio, this is meaningless.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   So nowhere in here is a Jeff Jarvis.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I don't know if Gina's in there either.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I don't see a Gina or a Jeff.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   That's okay.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   All right.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Father Robert Ballester looking a lot like Si.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   That's Robert Gangnam style.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   What is that style? There's our producer Chad Johnson.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   OMG Chad. What is that style? Is there a name for that?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   I mean, it's like vector-based, you know, cell shading.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Vector-based cell shading. That's what it is.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   No, no, that's a real thing or not.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Friction stir welding.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   It's friction stir welding. It's a very, very good technique used for many of the...
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Martin, for Martin's course, for Martin.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   No, that I'm used to it. On Twitter, he says, "I guess I should add Jeff and Gina."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I'm not saying anything.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   It's a thing he's done for free for all of us.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   He's done a lot of people, so thank you, Martin.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   That's a great one.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   I'm asking this poor guy. He does really good work.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   I love these.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   He's going to send me the originals. I'm getting them printed out.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Oh, Peter, what is the technique called?
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   What's the button you push?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I still have to pass on.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   The problem with having a conversation with Twitter is it's not instant.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Yes.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Let's move on. We're going to take a break, come back, and talk about an interesting article
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   about Google and Apple and why...
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Well, Apple's big problem. Google is getting better at design faster than Apple is getting better at the Internet.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And the solution, according to Patrick Gibson, by Twitter.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   We'll talk about it in just a second, but first, a word from Squarespace,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   the secret behind exceptional websites and new Squarespace is here.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   And man, is it fantabulous? Everything you need to create an exceptional website.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   It's hosting plus the best software, but best hosting too.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Squarespace hosting never goes down. If you've got a Squarespace site, you could throw people at it.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   They've got some magic sauce that when their bandwidth is needed, it's there.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   And so it's just really beautifully done.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   And then the software is absolutely the best content management software out there.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Everything you want, including something very modern, they call it mobile responsive design.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You don't have a mobile site that's different from your desktop.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   You have one site that works great no matter what platform.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Everything with a 27-inch screen to a 3.5-inch iPhone 3GS, it looks fabulous.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And that's what Squarespace does so well.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   What's good about this is you get to use the designer templates.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You get to customize it. They handle the back end, so it automatically scales.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   For instance, when you upload an image to a blog post or a portfolio,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   it automatically makes seven thumbnails, one of each size, so it can choose the right image to display,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   depending on the screen capabilities of the device looking at it.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   This stuff is very, very cool.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   It integrates Twitter, Flickr, LinkedIn, Facebook, all everything.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So you can make this a live site for yourself.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   It would be great for a basic personal homepage, a blog, but also if you're a photographer, an artist,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   this is the greatest.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Look at the templates. They've got some great portfolio templates.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   And you could try this right now for free.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   For 14 days, you don't need a credit card. Just name your site, give it a password.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And you've got the run of the place for 14 days.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Now what's nice about that is you can really see how it looks.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   They've got importers for TypePad, WordPress, Blogger.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   All the stuff goes in, including all the images, all the links, all the comments, everything is preserved,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   so you can try something, see how it looks.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   And then if it looks good, look, this is Q-Birt.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I like this. This is a Pinterest-y style portfolio site,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   sophisticated portfolio template with a masonry style.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   That's what they call that, the masonry style layout.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Designers and photographers choose it for its contemporary style.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Anyway, once you try it, and by the way, you could try every single template.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   It's just a click of the button.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Remember CSS Zen Garden and how the content never changed,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   but the templates would change and it would just be completely looking.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   That's what they're doing here with CSS, HTML5, JavaScript.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   You don't have to know that stuff. It does it automatically.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Although, I should point out because we have a sophisticated audience,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   if you do know it, they've got a code editor that does automatic syntax,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   color, I mean, they've got all the features for JavaScript, CSS,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   you know, programmer to get involved with.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Once you decide, yeah, this is for me, check out the prices.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   This is where it really goes. It's just crazy.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   This is for hosting, plus the software, plus everything,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   always up to date, always secure because they're maintaining the code for you.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   The standard is $8 a month when you buy an annual plan,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   but the one you should look at is the unlimited plan.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   When you buy a year's worth and you can buy more and save even more,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   $16 a month for unlimited galleries, unlimited pages,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   unlimited bandwidth.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   So even if suddenly, you know, your site is mentioned on the Super Bowl
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   and a million people hit it, no problem.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Unlimited bandwidth, won't cost you a penny.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Unlimited storage, unlimited, I mean, this is so great.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   When you buy an annual plan, they also will give free domain registration
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   and get a custom domain, link it up, do all that stuff too.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I just think Squarespace is so cool.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   I want you to try it.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Do remember if you decide to buy that we've got a deal,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Twig 11 is the offer code.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   So you don't need that just to try it.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   But when you decide to buy, there'll be an offer code on that page.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   TWIG11 will get you 10% off that first purchase.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Make it a year's purchase.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   You'll save even more.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Twig11, the offer code.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Squarespace.com.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Did you guys read this?
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Now, this is old.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Did you talk about this last week?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Patrick Gibson's blog.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   He says the problem Google is getting better at design.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   In other words, Google, traditionally Google were the engineers.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   They understood the web and Apple was the design genius as they understood product.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And there was a difference.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   But the problem, according to this blog post, Google is getting better at design
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   faster.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   And that's obvious that Apple is getting it web services.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And he uses some examples.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Apple still can't update its online store without taking it offline.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Web objects.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And that's the problem.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Oh, I thought that was stick.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   I didn't think it was technical reasons.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   No!
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   It's because their framework, Web objects which Apple relies on, is 20 years old.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Wow.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Gina, you knew it.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Yeah, I mean also the iTunes, like the developer portal for iTunes Connect,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   which is where you update same thing.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Part of it.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Remember when Game Center was down?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Because everybody was playing...
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Lutter process.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Brought Game Center down.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   One game.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   He says, "I love this.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I message for Mac lives in an alternate dimension in which time has no ordered sequence."
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Because these messages come in randomly.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Everything Apple does which involves the Internet is a mess as Patrick.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Patrick used to use it, work at Apple.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   So I think he kind of has an insider's perspective.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Except for Safari, which is awesome.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   WebKit is awesome.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Meanwhile, Google has been steadily improving its entire platform.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And I think everybody will agree with Jelly Bean, especially with 4.2.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Yes.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Google's...
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I mean, for all intents and purposes, caught up.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   It's smooth, it's elegant, it's simple.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Yeah, I mean I'm happy to...
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   We didn't talk about this before.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   But it's true, I agree that Apple's sort of a mess when it comes to Web Services.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   And I do agree that Google's getting better at design.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   But...
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   There's still not Apple.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   They're not...
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Oh, they're not Apple.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And the problem that Google has, and I criticize because I love, and the more I use the new Android 4.2, the more I'm convinced,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   it's just settings overload.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Yes.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   The two different shades.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   I mean, I went to go take a picture of my daughter with the Galaxy Nexus, and I hadn't taken a picture with it.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I've been using the iPhone because the camera is just so fast and it's just better for babies.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   But I grabbed the Galaxy Nexus, I went to go take a picture, and I put my finger down on the kind of viewfinder,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   and I was talking about this with Kevin.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   This like radial orb shows up.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And it's, you know, there's like the white balance and like the flash, and there's just all these crazy settings.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   And I happened, my finger happened to move and I missed the picture.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Like the picture was just this kind of blur because my daughter had spit up, you know, by the time I had figured out that I had just adjusted the white balance.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   But I was like, why am I adjusting the white?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Like I'm trying to take, you know, snap a photo of my daughter.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And I just, I worry that Google is stuffing like power user features into more or less like that photo sphere and the sliding keyboard.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Really cool.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   I love it.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   I just, I just question whether or not those should be in the core operating system.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   And the window shade, the window shade thing, I'm not happy about the fact that there's two different window shades now.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   You know, there's like the user one and then there's the notifications one.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   So I worry that Google stuff.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   How do you, okay.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   So I don't have that yet.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   What did, so when I pull down from the top on four one, I get notifications.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   There's a single window shade.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   There's two different things.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   This one, the boxy one is going to pull down what, you know, my Wi-Fi.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Well, work, work right now.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   So I think Google is getting better at typography and color and that kind of thing and smoothness.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I don't think they're getting better at simplicity.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   I think they're getting worse.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Kind of like windows.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   It was kind of like the windows versus Mac thing.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Windows was always that way.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   8,000 settings.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Four different ways to do any given thing.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Yep.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Yep.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   So, so I think this is a good post.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I just thought it was interesting that he, Patrick Gibson bullet pointed the ways that Apple isn't good at web services, but didn't, but didn't quite.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   But didn't bullet point all the ways that Google is like, you know, is getting better at design.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   I do agree that I think Google is getting better at design, but again, I think it's more about looking feeling less about simplicity.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I feel like there's so many settings buttons everywhere.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And you see it in the web apps too.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Well, they did take, they did take the, for example, developer options out of the settings menu in 4.2.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   So, I mean, I, so, but I agree, there are a lot of other things that, that window shade thing drove my, my mom's like, where did my settings go?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   I don't know where my settings are anymore.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   And I was like, oh yeah, you just have to pull down on this other part of the screen, mom.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And so, I agree.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   There are some things that they can clean up.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And those, but I think those are iterative things.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   I mean, I think that'll get better and better.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   I think that they've shown that, that they are paying more attention to design.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   And they're hiring designers.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   I mean, they've hired a lot of, you know, top designers to work on user interface, which they've never done in the past.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   It seemed like.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Remember, the premise is not that Google is now better at design, but they're getting better faster than Apple.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   That Apple is making progress in on web services.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And what's going to be more important in the long run?
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   If you can, if you can have decent design and your web services work, which is where Google is right now, he points out Google now, which is just, it's, the more I use it.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I'm in Australia.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   It knows and I'm in Australia.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   I'm so frustrated with Google now.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   It won't, it's supposed to give you the weather every single time it doesn't give it to me.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   It doesn't give me information.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   You're now is broken.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   I don't understand why your now does not work.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   It's my work's great.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I get nothing.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And when, and for instance, there's a card on my now that is, that came by default, but I, but I like it that said, whenever a stock in your portfolio changes by more than 1% flag it.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   So Google is up 12, almost 13 bucks today.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   So I see that.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   That's, that's what you want, right?
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Here's my weather.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Here's my next appointment.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   When the, when the Niners play, I will see the Niners going to play tomorrow.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Then after the game, I will see the scores.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Actually during the game, I'll see the school.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And this is mostly based on stuff I've searched on.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And then I, you can refine it.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   There's a menu on all of them.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   So that you can, I think this is a really good example.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I think the Google voice has gotten better than faster than Siri, right?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Am I, am I not right?
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Google voice search is great.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Google voice search is fantastic.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And it seems like Google's really trying to, to work on this, right?
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I mean, they're actually calling people.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   We talked about this on TNT this morning.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   I think there's an article in the thing about how to get on Google's trying to find the un-Googleable.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Where they're actually calling people saying, whoa, what kind of things, you know, were you
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   thinking about today?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   What kind of things might you have searched for but didn't actually type into the search engine?
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   And so they're trying to broaden this out to capture more of this stuff and bring it into,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   well, theoretically anyway, bring it into the mobile platform, bring it into Google now,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   so that it can offer you more and more information that will be useful to you,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   so that it keeps you in the locked into the Google verse.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Which is the point I've made in the show before and it's now become fully true with me,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   is that as I've said in the show before, that it's the services that led me to the hardware.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   The hardware and the design are good enough to make me happy.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   So I have not picked up my iPhone.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Good enough.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Well, that's what the project, what he's saying is, it's passed.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   There's a critical mass point.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   It's passed.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   It's no longer so geeky you can't bear it.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   It's the design has gotten so much better that I can now say this is pretty nice.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And the hardware is, you know, they're having some sense with hardware too.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Surprisingly, who would think?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   So I'm now, you know, we're talking about this a little later I guess,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   but I'm now fully in the Google world.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   I'm my second-
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   How's your Chromebook going?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   It's great, in fact, because one thing Google is really, really bad at is running stores.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Radio Shack would do a better job running the store than Google does.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   So I went nuts.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   It was like the time we were buying something, I forgot what it was, Leo on the show,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   and we were all trying to buy it before.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   So I couldn't get the 16 gig and I went nuts and I finally got the 8 gig.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   That's the Nexus 4 you're waving there.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   That's the Nexus 4, right?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And I debated whether to even open it and Gina said, "How could you not open it?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   You got a box there, open it, you fools."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   You know what, you can't get it now.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   You're good, you got it.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   No, you can't.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   No, you can't.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   It's back up and so you can get it.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   You have a few weeks, you got to wait weeks, but you can get it now.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   But they couldn't even do that.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   They, you know, is on and off in minutes and gone and then the same for the Chromebook.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   So all you could get in the Chromebook, which I had to go through, you know, all kinds of hoops to get the non-wife,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   the non-3G version.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   So I opened that, started using it, and then a friend once it for his daughter because the 3G version,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   I think, arrived today with UPS at my home, which I had ordered on Amazon ages ago.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And then suddenly I don't know where they said it's going to be in December before you get this on the...
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I got it.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Wow.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   You can't get that.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   You can't get the Chromebook.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Now, having said all that, the report so far on this is that it works magnificently.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   I mean, it's the Chromebook hardware is not the greatest, and we'll talk about, you know, some other advances in a second on that.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   The trackpad's a little bit sluggish.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   It doesn't have a caps lock key and so on.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   But the truth is that I am living 100% in Android and Chrome, and I have not had any need to do anything else.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   The two times that I've almost fallen off the wagon were both stupid and wrong.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   The first was I was writing a piece for a German newspaper that wanted a character count, not a word count.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   I couldn't get that in Gmail, and I should of course go on to Docs.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Instead I thought I got open up with a word.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   I was wrong, Docs had it even better.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   The second time today was I was trying to get a new book out of Columbia and NYU that's in the EPUB format
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   and I was into my damn Kindle software and I couldn't do it.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   I finally got that worked out, but I thought I had to download an app outside of Chrome.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I was wrong in both cases.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   So far, three weeks I have been living purely inside Chrome and inside Android and been pleased as punch.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   It had no reason, none, to go outside.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   You're on Skype right now, right?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   That's the only thing.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   The irony here is that this show is the only thing that's causing me to go out.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Chad and I are going to do an experiment.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Are we going to call him on Google Talk?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   All right, let's do it right now.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Do you want to?
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Are you set up Jeff to do that?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   You probably can't use your mic and all that stuff.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Maybe you can.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   No, you can.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   So let me walk through what Jeff is going to have to do.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   You're going to have to add me to your chat contact list on your Gmail window.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   And then I'm going to start up the Google Talk within the browser.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Sounds like you've done this before.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Yeah, not on air, not on Twitch.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Just in general.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Just in general.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Okay.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   So it's 200...
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Now, you can't get it anymore.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Unfortunately, because the Acer that they're selling now is not as well-bayed.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   It's cheaper.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   There's a story coming out.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   We might as well jump to it right now.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   A story in the rundown that Google is reportedly working on its own branded Google hardware.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Or the Chromebook with a touchscreen.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Although the Samsung, everybody agrees this is very nicely made, right?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It's very nicely made.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   I like it quite a bit.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   It's as late as an error.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   It fits in the same...
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Do you think you'd be as happy or maybe even happier if it were Android instead?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Part of my question is why does Google have two...
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   You said this, I think, era.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Two OS's.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   What's the point?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   The difference was always keyboard.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   You know, that Chrome OS was for keyboard and Android was for touchscreen.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But you can use Android with a keyboard as Asus and many other devices.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   There's a file system on Android.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Not very good.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   It's pretty crappy.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   And I just went through it today trying to get this ePub thing in and it's real pain.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And so that's one second.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Is there a file system on Chrome OS?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Is it exposed?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   That's a good question.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   It's a good question.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   I don't know if it's exposed.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   When you upload, yeah.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   If you put a camera card or at least on older versions, you put, like, say, an SD card, you could...
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Open a file and browse folders.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Right, Jeff?
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   I think that's pretty much it.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   What do I get in here?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   You calling me?
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Sorry.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   That hit your phone.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   It's supposed to hit your Gmail.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   I tell you, the multitasking Jeff Jarvis is doing right now is quite impressive.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   I'm very sorry.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Because as he's delivering a story, he's apparently setting up G-Talk.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Oh, I'm not doing crap.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   And I'm...
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   So I'll talk.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   I'll talk.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   You work.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   China Times reports Google intends to launch Chrome OS netbooks with touch screens.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Now that I'm intrigued by Compaul, which is in a Taiwan-based manufacturer talked or is
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.360]   tasked with the manufacturing according to this report, China Times.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.440]   And it's not Acer.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   It's not Asus.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.400]   It's Google placing the order itself.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:14.720]   Internal components begin shipping to Compaul this month, which means the product itself
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.000]   will probably not ship according to the China Times for 2013.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.040]   Chrome OS is not a touch operating system though.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.520]   I mean, when you think about the way that the tap to zoom and gestures, none of that
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.520]   stuff is in there.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.520]   When you think about what the point is...
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.520]   Maybe it's an Android notebook.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.240]   Yeah, I just don't feel like Chrome OS with a touch screen would make any sense because
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.000]   it just wasn't ever designed for a touch screen.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I really want Android.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   That would be...
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Now we're talking.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Now we're cooking with gas.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.600]   You know the thing about the Chromebook is when I've shown it to people, I've shown it
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.520]   to parents and parents go nuts for it.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:56.120]   In fact, Ms. Howell has one for her kid because her school is entirely Google Docs.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.720]   So parents of kids say this is the perfect first laptop for them, so I'm uncontrollable
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.720]   and so on and so forth.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.920]   And then I showed it out on the media companies I work with and my first thought was local
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.560]   correspondents and reporters and then the head of the business came in and said, "Oh
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.120]   hell, sales per people.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   Jesus.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   It's $39.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.760]   I only get this for all my salespeople."
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.760]   And so it's...
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.920]   Again, it's a good enough thing.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.080]   It's credible to people.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.720]   People aren't looking at it and saying, "Oh, that's a toy.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   Oh, it's nothing."
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.640]   They're saying, "Yeah, I live in the browser.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   Yeah, $249.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.640]   Yeah."
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.320]   And I'm not even upset that Google make up with a new machine next year because the price
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.320]   is so reasonable.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.320]   Fine.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.080]   I can buy eight of these for the price of a loaded MacBook Air.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.640]   I'm buying a...
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.000]   I wonder if the acceptance is the netbook factor.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   There's a price factor and people will get by the couple of months ago, "Oh, this was
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.680]   a mistake," as they did with netbooks or if there really is genuinely something going.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.120]   You think this is better made than the netbooks that you saw this time.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.880]   I mean, it's still a bit plasticky.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.240]   The cover can rub a little bit.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.200]   As I say, the trackpad is sluggish.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.560]   It's good for kids and dogs.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.800]   But it starts up like that, of course.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   And it's simple.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.640]   And I get a new machine tonight.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.040]   I already wiped the old machine.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.040]   What did I do to wipe the old machine?
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040]   I hit one button and it's wiped.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.040]   Tonight I'm on a machine.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.360]   I'm going to put in two screens, put it in my language and password and then boom,
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.680]   it is fully loaded with everything that I need.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.840]   It automatically downloads all of my Google Docs to the machine.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.960]   I use the Gmail app so I get all my mail offline.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.520]   I mean, I've got to push some things.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.040]   I've got to try a web video and things like that.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.960]   But it's just so incredibly easy.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:41.240]   I think it's also the ideal grandma machine.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.240]   And it's fourth.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   Really?
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.920]   As opposed to say an iPad?
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   To install.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.320]   There's nothing to do.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.320]   Grandma, you use a browser?
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   Yes, I do.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   Okay, grandma, here's a machine.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.320]   It's all it does.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.320]   Oh, thanks.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   What about photos?
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.160]   What about photos of the grandkids?
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.160]   Right?
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.160]   Like...
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.160]   The Casa Web.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.400]   But that right.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.920]   So like, my mother-in-law needs a new computer.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.360]   But photos is a big thing for her.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.000]   So she would just have to upload everything to the Casa Web, basically.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.040]   Yeah, or you would.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   Or I would.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.040]   We're...
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.880]   Chad thinks I have the Chromebook with me.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.400]   I don't have the Chromebook with me because I wiped it for the people I'm selling it.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.400]   I thought you liked it.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   You're selling it?
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.040]   Because I got the higher-end version.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.040]   Ah.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.760]   So you don't have anything with you?
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.840]   Oh, I don't have it with me.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.840]   So I'm sorry, Chad.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.720]   Oh, no problem.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.320]   So we're not going to do this then.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.640]   We could have gone through the crisis.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.960]   I also use that.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.480]   We could call you on Google talk.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   No, but there's no point in the line.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.200]   And we'd be able to use it on the Chromebook.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   Right.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   We'll try it by the next show.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   Next show, you'll have a Chromebook.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.360]   Yeah, let's schedule the time to test.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.360]   Okay.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.360]   There's no ethernet port though, right?
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.360]   Uh, Jeff?
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.360]   No.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.360]   Just wireless.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.960]   Oh, the weird thing is it has a HDMI port.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.440]   And it has two USB-1-FAP.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.640]   So you could hook it up to a big screen.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.240]   So Padre-SJ raises the specter.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.240]   And by the way, you know, I was on this cruise, Sal Sigoyan, who works at Apple.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.800]   He's the Apple script guy and the automated guy at Apple and is a great guy.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.240]   He's a lecturer.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:18.480]   And his nephew, I think, Chris Sigoyan is a very outspoken security expert who I think
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.400]   has raised Sal's consciousness.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.640]   And Padre-SJ and Sal have both said the same thing, which is the problem with cloud services
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.160]   is that enterprises are very nervous that by putting your data in the cloud, you're
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.720]   essentially giving it to the government or who knows, but the government at the very
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:43.520]   least because of this precedent of search warrantless access to this data.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.520]   That's a big change.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.400]   And also it's an issue across borders.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.160]   So one of the stories in the rundown today is that Google is now allowing European ventures
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:56.520]   to decree that their data shall be stored on a European server.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:01.240]   So a lot of people, even in Canada, Canadians can't stand the idea of their data being on
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.680]   American servers because of our terrorism laws.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:12.880]   That's the basis of so much of the privacy talk out of both the EU and Canada is American
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.560]   anti-terrorism and Google, and your data on Facebook and Google being here.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.600]   So Google just changed this today where European companies can say, nope, they wonder what
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.080]   country they're in, but they'll know they're in the warm confines of the EU.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.680]   We should explain that Padre-SJ is Father Robert Ballister, who's the host of our enterprise
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.600]   show this weekend enterprise tech.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:37.240]   So Robert, he's in the chat room right now, but Robert, do you, when you talk to enterprises,
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:42.520]   our enterprises leery of using third party cloud services for this reason because they're
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:47.160]   afraid that it in effect, I understand if you're in Canada that you'd be, but what if
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.360]   you're a US enterprise?
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.520]   I guess he says the problem is that the problematic precedent is the mega upload case where the
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:00.320]   Department of Justice said, well, we didn't see his data, we see servers that happen to
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.840]   have data on it.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:07.840]   Therefore, we didn't need a search warrant for the user's data that was on mega upload.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:13.280]   So he says it means as an enterprise user, I have to worry about every user on the servers
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.720]   that I share.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:21.400]   So if, in other words, if you're on a, you know, if a Google Doc server is subpoenaed by the
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:30.200]   DOJ, because of one bad actor on that server, and your data is on there, the DOJ's position
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.920]   is, well, you know, we got the server and we can look at anything that's on there.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.760]   That seems terrifying to big business, any business.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.400]   There's also compliance issues in general.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.560]   And violate government regulations.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.560]   Right.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.040]   I mean, it may or it may not, depending on how you define it, but certainly companies
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   that I talk to are worried mostly about compliance issues.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.160]   If they have, if you're a financial company, you know, Citibank, something like that, you're
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:58.480]   probably big enough to run your own cloud services inside your corporate network anyway.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.000]   And even if you, even if you wanted to go out, you probably couldn't just because you'd
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.200]   be worried about the compliance issues.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.200]   Right.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.200]   Well, and that's what Chris Seguayan was arguing is that really, you really, if you're going
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.760]   to use the cloud, it should be your cloud.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.360]   You need to control those servers.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.240]   You can't, you can't let some third parties cloud.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.000]   But I guess you couldn't encrypt and then upload.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   You could encrypt it.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.600]   It breaks a lot of the features though of some of these services because they can't look
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   into the data.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.000]   Well, not only that, but if you encrypt before you, you know, there are algorithms and things
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.600]   in the, in the networking that, that compress the data, right?
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   Right.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.720]   So if you encrypt on your end, slows it down and then you, you can't compress it because
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.880]   all the numbers are jumbled up.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.960]   So it's so you can't compress.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:39.080]   So it ruins your, your throughput usually up to the cloud.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.200]   So there's other issues as well.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.600]   Interesting.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:49.560]   I presume Google wants to address this that they're certainly making an outreach to enterprise.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:54.720]   I guess one way to let companies have their servers in the international look.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.400]   Is that a setting or is that you have to call my Google representative to change that?
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   I don't know.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   The story is in there.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.640]   It's under, I put together, oh, it was changed.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.280]   I had a whole bunch of things together.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:10.080]   Here is ZDNet story.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.680]   Google Cloud lets customers park their data in Europe, Jack Clark for CloudWatch.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:21.640]   Now, so on Monday along with a range of other improvements to the company's cloud services,
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:27.800]   if you're using App Engine, cloud storage, Google Cloud SQL and soon Google Compute Engine,
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:33.800]   you can deploy your applications data and virtual machines to European data centers.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:40.960]   Customers will not be able to select where in Europe, just somewhere in Europe.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.160]   I guess if you're in the EU, you're in the EU, right?
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:49.760]   Unless you're required by law to keep your data in the country that you are coming from.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.080]   Right, which is part of it.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:56.200]   There's also the privacy stuff coming up is that one of the proposals is that European's
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.280]   data must be held under EU standards anywhere in the world.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.800]   One easy way to do that and firewall off the higher or difficult standards of Europe is
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   to say, "Okay, we're going to store European's data in Europe and we can do whatever we
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   want elsewhere."
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:16.320]   Very interesting.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:24.840]   Let's see, what else is going on?
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:29.680]   According to Tom's hardware, a Nexus Chromebook for first quarter of next year, is that the
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.840]   same one that China times?
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:31.840]   It's the same one.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:32.840]   Okay.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.840]   Maybe the Nexus brand is going to be the next.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.760]   The Nexus then is going to be their Google's hardware brand.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.360]   I think it is, right?
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:45.680]   By the way, this stupid thing, when I did open up the Nexus 4, here's my confession.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.000]   I'm thinking, "Well, it just doesn't feel quite the same, quite as good in the hand."
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   There's this sharp edge here.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   I know this whole thing about how they were...
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   You can take the plastic cover off the edges.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.600]   Yeah, well, that was the plastic top of the bottom off.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.680]   There were little tiny plastic slivers along the aluminum here on the side.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.360]   I didn't even know where they were there.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.360]   This is so strange.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.680]   It's going to get dirty and I don't like that.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.680]   I'm stupid.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.680]   Now, I'm...
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.560]   Finally, I messed it up and I said, "Oh, it's not broken.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.560]   It's the plastic.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.920]   It took it all off and it feels pretty good now."
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.920]   We've been trying to get one.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:21.040]   Now, if you want the 8-gigabyte version, it's 8 to 9 weeks in the Play Store as I speak.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.560]   The 16-gigabyte says 4 to 5 weeks.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.280]   I know we were seeing some people say, "Oh, no, it's available now."
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.080]   We rushed over yesterday.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.960]   Supposedly, it was available now, but I guess that's...
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.960]   There, yesterday, it was...
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   They sold out again.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.960]   Yeah, they had all kinds of trouble yesterday.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.960]   How did they work?
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.320]   Yeah, by available, it was available to buy, not...
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.600]   But nobody was able to buy it.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.400]   Well, no, we were able to purchase it.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.240]   You couldn't even purchase it in place at order before.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.880]   So available means you can get it in 4 to 5 weeks of it.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:51.880]   Exactly.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.880]   And Tony already got one.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.200]   Tony's the spot one.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   Oh, he's already...
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.760]   So I won't buy one.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:01.320]   I like it that they're taking a page from the Apple book and they're spending a $20 bumper.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.920]   Yeah, I know.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.920]   They're calling it...
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   I noticed that.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   They're calling it the same thing that Apple called it.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.120]   Well, that's all profit, baby.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.960]   That's a nickel worth of plastic right there.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.960]   Unbelievable.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:17.600]   If you've made it to supposedly be, "Oh, so hand can be," then why would you put the
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   rubber bumper around that?
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.600]   It kind of makes me feel like they must have an antenna problem.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.160]   No, no, no, the problem is it's plastic.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.320]   So smart ass.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.320]   So...
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.320]   Well...
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   It's so bad.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.040]   Without the bumper.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.040]   Sold out.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.440]   Sold out, $20.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.560]   I like the look of that back, but I don't understand why they put a glass.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   I don't either.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   I mean, you already have a liability with the front being glass and then you add glass
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   to the back.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   How could you be sold out of a piece of plastic?
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.560]   I don't know.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:50.200]   I could call somebody in China right now and have a million of those ready by next week.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.800]   Yeah, I swear to God.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.440]   Let's kickstart it.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.160]   How could you be sold out?
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.160]   That is...
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.640]   I'm missing something.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.320]   This sounds a little bit like a marketing ploy.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.760]   How could you be sold out of a molded piece of plastic?
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   I...
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.760]   This is where the...
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.560]   They don't know how to take orders in advance and they don't know how to do inventory.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.360]   There's a lot they don't know about retail.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.360]   There's all that.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.200]   I'd call somebody in China.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.360]   You know, just call Tim Cook and ask him.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:21.160]   Tim, if you wanted to make a million bumpers by next week, what would you do?
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.520]   They probably made 10 of them.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   Not to be mean.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.600]   I feel like I'm being really critical of Google to show, but you know, between the
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.280]   Q and the Chromebook.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   I mean, they've done...
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   They really don't get it.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   ...that's inter-inventory.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:36.520]   I've not had the problem of being assolled out really so far.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.880]   So, you know, they're getting there.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.880]   I think getting there.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.400]   They're getting to the good part.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   Sold out.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.880]   Well, I don't know.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.920]   I mean, I'm really happy with the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.080]   I am really, really happy with this.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.680]   So I don't feel too much of an urge.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.680]   What did you do in Australia?
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   Did you get a little...
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.680]   I brought this.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.680]   I brought...
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.680]   You know, I wish I had.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   And in fact, I found out later I talked to a Telstra rep.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.600]   He said, "Oh yeah, this works at sea for like miles.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.480]   I could have used it much of the trip."
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:07.760]   But then we went to New Caledonia, which is part of the French protectorate or something.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:10.160]   And I don't know what I would have done there.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.160]   So I just...
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.720]   I paid a lot of money for...
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.000]   Every time I think of New Dalek, Caledonia, I think of Michael's Navy.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Michael's Navy.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Everybody does.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.600]   Well, not our fellow hosts on the show.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.160]   Only us aged people.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.440]   Our well-aged people.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   We know.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.600]   And Wikipedia as fast as I can.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.240]   She doesn't even know what Michael's Navy is.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.240]   No, I do.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.240]   Have you heard of her earlier?
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.240]   Her or not?
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240]   Captain Binghamton.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.240]   Aaron, help her.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:41.720]   I had this problem last time with Eugene with Battlestar Galer.
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.720]   Or with...
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.720]   Well, she's heard of that.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.720]   Not Battlestar Galactica.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.720]   It was Buck Rogers.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.720]   And Twiggy.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.920]   Remember, I was saying, "No, don't you remember Twiggy?"
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   Because somebody was doing baby.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.280]   And I was like, "Oh, that's Twiggy."
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.520]   I can see why you don't know this.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:57.520]   This ran from 1962 to 1966.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.520]   Oh my God.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   Is it the show?
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   Is it the show?
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.720]   I wasn't born yet.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.040]   Yeah, I saw it reruns, but I never saw the show.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:13.200]   But the idea was that the Captain Binghamton, their boss, was stationed in New Meya, New
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.200]   Caledonia.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:19.840]   But that's because the entire United States fleet for the South Pacific was based there.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.840]   That was the...
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:25.080]   That may be the worst detour I've ever caused on this show.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.640]   I love Joel McCarry.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   Okay.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:33.920]   Did you know that Fred Astaire introduced television audiences to the McHale character?
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.440]   Did you know that?
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.880]   Because it was part of Alcoa Presents in 1962.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.080]   He was in a non-existent island, Taratupa.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.640]   Actually, that's a funny...
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.840]   There is a Google tie in there.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:50.400]   Because after I get back, there's a story that Google Maps has an island that doesn't
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.080]   exist in New Caledonia.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.280]   Apparently, we sailed right through it.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.520]   There's no island there.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.680]   And they can't quite figure out why.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.480]   All the maps have this island.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.440]   It's called Sandy Bar, Sand Bar, something like that.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.440]   Doesn't exist.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:11.880]   I thought I was just there.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:12.880]   That's cool.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:14.880]   And I didn't see it.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.160]   I looked.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.400]   We did see a total eclipse.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   That is cool.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.640]   If you ever get to see a total eclipse.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.480]   In this day and age, where everything could go on YouTube and watch a total eclipse, it's
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.440]   not the same kids.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:31.160]   You can't...a total eclipse on the TV, on the YouTube, it's on the Twitter.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.520]   It's not the same.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.960]   Because you're standing there.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.480]   It's almost 6 a.m.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.560]   You're standing there.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.400]   It's getting a little dark.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.920]   And then all of a sudden, it was funny because there's so much power from the sun.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.160]   Even a sliver of the sun, it's still a daytime.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:49.560]   Then all of a sudden, it's like somebody turned the lights out.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:53.520]   It is actually kind of a creepy, like something's wrong feeling.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.400]   You can see why primitive peoples went crazy.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.920]   Somebody turned out the lights.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.840]   And you don't know if it's going to come back or not.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.840]   I mean, I knew.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.080]   It's the same for us when the internet goes out.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.120]   Yes, and that was another thing.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.560]   There's no internet at sea.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.600]   Now there is, but it's very slow.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.600]   Might as well not be any.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.400]   Well, sorry, you're going to pay like 60 cents a minute or something.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.400]   It's a ridiculous rate.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.400]   It's a 25 cents a minute.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.760]   You don't pay by the...
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.120]   And the reason they charge you by the minute is because it's so damn slow that it takes
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.360]   an hour to get an email.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.520]   So they really got you.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.520]   They got you.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.520]   It's fine.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.520]   It was a very good experience for me.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:31.680]   But I'll tell you, you realize and I think the Chromebook would have been pretty useless
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:38.800]   that without internet connectivity, even a normal computer kind of is reduced to useless.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.560]   It was predicted that you would say that, Leo.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.560]   Yes.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.200]   But a cloud computer.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.520]   Not so good.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:50.080]   So while I was down there, there was a case going on.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:55:02.080]   The Australian courts, Google is being sued in a libel case and lost.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.880]   The stupidity of governments and courts, we're going to get to Germany in a minute again.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:06.880]   Shocking.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:07.880]   It's just astounding.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:11.720]   The lack of understanding of how this works and what this is.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.720]   They're holding it.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.560]   Google is responsible for anything bad that Google points to, which means that Google
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:19.920]   can point to nothing.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:25.560]   The little rod, Tricula is a music promoter.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:30.160]   He was, there's somewhere somebody put a website up that linked him with criminal figures in
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.160]   Melbourne.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:36.880]   He's never been involved in criminal activity, but he did get shot in a restaurant in 2004.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:42.160]   His lawyers wrote to Google in 2009 asking for the article, which included a number of
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.040]   images to be removed.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.520]   Google said in line with our policies on content removal, you should contact the owners
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:52.240]   of the website because we can't remove it.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.440]   So he sued Google.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   Jury, jury, there's the problem.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:05.360]   Jury concluded the search engine was the publisher of the images of Tricula and related
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.440]   information.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.880]   And Google's defense was innocent dissemination.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.120]   How many times have I said that?
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:23.200]   But it only, I'm sorry, I still have the mind of a 12 year old, I'm sorry.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.040]   I'll stop before I disseminate.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.920]   Said that protected them only.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.040]   That's right.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.920]   Only until they were put on notice that there was defamatory content.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.880]   At that point, the jury said you should have taken it down.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:41.880]   Now this guy had already won a quarter of a million dollars against Yahoo, which did
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:47.760]   actually host the site and Google had to pay $200,000.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.840]   I presume they will appeal.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:54.160]   It's kind of stunning.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.160]   It really is.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:02.120]   The idiocy is spreading all around and Google is constantly the bad guy and all this stuff.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.840]   Well, because they're the number one search engine.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:11.440]   I wonder if they argued the cash that Google was hosting it because it was caching images.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:15.640]   I think they'll be sophisticated for them, Gina.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.640]   It worked more like this.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:22.480]   I searched for his name and pictures of him showed up on the results.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   So it's Google's fault.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.200]   Should have done that in an Australian accent.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   You know, you move it up.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.200]   I did.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.200]   And I'm not going back.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   Okay.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.200]   Thank you.
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.440]   So now we fast forward to Germany.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:45.980]   We're out in Zufund, Finland, Vasto, Jewish, Eli Stung's Schutzrecht is being read in the
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.080]   in the Bundestag tomorrow.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.600]   First reading it by all accounts will go toward and become law.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.300]   This is the ancillary copyright that says the Google must pay publishers Google and
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.300]   others.
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.480]   Unknown others could be bloggers have to pay.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:03.900]   There's no fair use fair comment legislation on the books there.
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:08.820]   And so the for the privilege of sending someone traffic by quoting them and linking them,
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.700]   you're going to have to pay.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:16.180]   This is a, you know, a horrible mashup of dying media companies.
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.500]   And I know a lot of people who are doing this with government.
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:26.740]   Now Google finally, finally, finally, finally decided to speak back.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:31.300]   And there's a video you may want to show with no sound necessarily on the shows what
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.300]   they're doing.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:37.780]   And our net for your vertig diga dinettes.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:42.860]   We can cut the music on this, but this is showing people searching the net.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:49.700]   And in my post, I, I translate what it says at the end with only some reliability, of
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:54.940]   course, where they say, come on up, come on, come on post.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:59.020]   Why do I get these redirect messages out of sheets?
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.020]   Very upsetting.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:03.460]   You didn't hang them up properly.
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:04.660]   Between the sheets.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:07.660]   My recommendation is a little bit of bleach.
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:09.020]   I need some more stuff.
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:14.340]   And of course, that's, we hear that that's the way business plan needs more, more starch
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.340]   in their sheets.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:20.260]   I put it in here, says Google, anytime you want, you can find what moves you.
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.140]   A planned law will now change that.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.140]   Do you want that?
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.140]   Take action.
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.140]   Defend your net.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.300]   Continue to find what you seek.
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:33.580]   And a petition, which they say I think they've gotten 25,000 signatures on.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:38.340]   But then a friend of mine in German, the German market said that this was actually a PR blunder
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:43.740]   on Google's behalf, because what the publishers are doing now and the lawmakers are doing
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:49.780]   now is that anybody who's against this stupid law is now, well, you're a Google friend.
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:53.220]   That's a bad thing to be in Germany, because Google's big and capitalistic and American
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.860]   and technological.
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:57.420]   And I know all the Germans are going to come out from me and get mad at me, but fun.
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.620]   Prove it by getting rid of this stupid ass law.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.660]   That's because you're a Google front, you little shaker.
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.260]   It's been Google.
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.460]   And Google front.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.220]   What's wrong with being a Google friend, by the way?
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.220]   Is friends fanboy?
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.620]   Is that the same as fanboy?
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:17.820]   Well, it just means that you're, you're, you know, you like this big capitalistic American
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.820]   enterprise.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.420]   And I know people are going to get mad at me for saying this, but every time I go there,
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.660]   I get, well, Google makes too much money.
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.660]   Google has too much power.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.660]   Google's to this.
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:26.660]   Google's to that.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.740]   And, and this law is stupid and your publishers are taking you for a ride.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.100]   They're taking free speech for a ride.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.300]   They're taking the net for a ride.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.620]   They're going to devalue the link.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:38.860]   They're going to make Germany into a backwoods of technological innovation because no technology
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.140]   company is going to want to develop their damage.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:45.540]   So if you think I'm wrong, fine, get this law defeated, tech people rise up.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.540]   That's not what's happening.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:50.860]   So go try and do nothing on, on this and on the ITU on both.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.740]   And this is really interesting to me that finally this week, Google is fighting back
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:01:00.340]   on a few fronts on calling alarm on the ITU, which we'll talk about in a second, on, on
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.940]   the Leistroogne Schutzrecht in Germany.
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:09.580]   By the way, did you know that there was a, a reggae made of me saying that on this show?
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:10.580]   What?
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:11.580]   Wait a minute.
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.580]   I got a search for reggae.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.580]   Jeff.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.580]   Sorry.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.580]   We got to see this.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:19.180]   I want you to continue, but we got to see the reggae.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.060]   Stop the show.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.060]   Stop the show.
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:24.860]   Everybody pause.
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.860]   Why reggae?
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.860]   Here it is.
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:27.860]   Reggae.
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.860]   I got it.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:29.860]   I got it.
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:30.860]   Let me find it here.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:34.620]   You tweeted it.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.620]   Reggae me.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:38.620]   This is YouTube.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.860]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.860]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.860]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.260]   We're trying to hear that.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.180]   Oh, skip the commercial.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.260]   In three, two, one.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:54.220]   Now we're probably going to get pulled from the internet because of this, but go ahead.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.700]   YouTube blocked, YouTube blocked a show of ours.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.700]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:03.700]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.620]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:11.060]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.060]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.460]   Why reggae?
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.460]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.460]   It's actually work.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.460]   It really works.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.460]   It does work.
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.460]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.460]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:26.100]   Let's just come up today.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.460]   The pinkest reggae artist in the world.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.460]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:36.460]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.460]   October 6th.
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.460]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.460]   I love the chat as the lights go in.
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.460]   Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.460]   I need a spleaf.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.460]   Give me a blood band.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.460]   Schutzrecht.
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.460]   Beautiful.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.460]   Beautiful.
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.460]   Beautiful.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:54.460]   The Leistroogne Schutzrecht.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:59.460]   Done by a German.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.460]   Yes.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.460]   What is like to Schutzrecht stand?
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.460]   That's the copyright law.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.460]   That's the law.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.460]   They don't even try to say it.
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.460]   They just say LSR.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:09.460]   That's funny.
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.460]   Okay.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:11.460]   Thank you.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.460]   That made my...
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:13.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:14.460]   That's a good thing.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.460]   That's good.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:18.460]   That's when you know you're Internet famous.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.460]   That beats a fake Twitter account.
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:22.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.460]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.460]   No doubt.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.460]   Absolutely.
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:26.460]   Right.
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.460]   So you got this thing going on.
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.460]   It's spreading to France.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.460]   It's spreading elsewhere in the world, shall we say, where you have publishers saying, "Hey,
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.460]   they're doing it in Germany.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:38.460]   Let's go after Google and stop them from linking to us."
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.460]   Which, of course, any publisher can do today.
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:44.460]   But they're trying to go and say, "No, Google linked to us and pay us.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.460]   It's like cable must carry."
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:50.460]   Now, if every publisher left Google, Google's no worse off.
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.460]   Google's news is nobody.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.460]   They like other sources of news.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:54.460]   They'll be fine.
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:55.460]   But the publishers won't hurt themselves.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.460]   But worse, they're going to hurt the Internet.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.460]   They're going to hurt the link.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.460]   And God...
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:03.460]   [imitates a noises]
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:04.460]   I want out of it.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.460]   Or else either that or I want a nice hit on some drugs and...
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.460]   It just seems obviously wrong.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.460]   It's just amazing.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.460]   But it's...
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:16.460]   It's spreading in quarters, I can't say, but it's spreading in quarters that surprise
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.460]   me.
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.460]   And it's dangerous.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.460]   And it's the same with Google calling the alarm over the ITU.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.460]   They are now saying, "Watch out your Internet's at risk."
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.460]   And yes, the ITU has to be...
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.460]   We showed a video last week, Leo, of what is the ITU?
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.460]   The meeting is happening, I think, next week.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.460]   Actually, this week, I think.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.460]   This week.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.460]   Governments, telephone companies...
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.460]   The International Telecommunications Union.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:46.460]   And because it's a UN chartered group, people are saying, "Watch out the UN wants to take
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:47.460]   over the Internet."
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:51.460]   Actually, Russia has been kind of pushing this among others.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:57.460]   This is an email leaked with kind of a secret strategy for what to do here.
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.460]   It's a step at a time.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.460]   No, out of this meeting, we won't lose the Internet.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:06.460]   But it's a step at a time where our Internet needs to be defended people from these dangers.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:10.460]   And yeah, we don't want to raise the battle arm, the bat signal, every single time, to the
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:14.460]   same level of alert and fear.
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:19.460]   But if we ignore too many of these things, then just one by one, it's going to happen.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:25.460]   Now, I don't know if you probably didn't talk about this because Michael Geist, who is one of the really smart guys,
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:32.460]   he's in Canada on this subject, wrote an article in the Toronto Star that says, "The ITU meeting
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:37.460]   is actually, there is more at stake here than who's in charge of the Internet.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:47.460]   It really is the issue of the European Union ISPs asking for a reframing of how the Internet works.
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.460]   They're promoting something called sender pay.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:53.460]   This is something that's come up before and it's actually come up in the Google context.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:58.460]   I think it was, it was Verizon or AT&T who said, "You know, Google really ought to pay for all the Internet
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:00.460]   bandwidth that they're using."
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.460]   Even though, of course, they already do pay.
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:06.460]   They do pay just as you pay for your access to the superhighway.
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.460]   They pay for their access to the superhighway.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:16.460]   But what is happening is big ISPs, let's say Comcast for Verizon, AT&T, would like Google to pay them for
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.460]   access to their customers.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:23.460]   And that's what sender pay is really double dipping and saying, "Yeah, you pay to get on the Internet,
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:28.460]   but if you want to talk to a Leo who's a Comcast user, then you're going to have to pay us extra.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:31.460]   Otherwise, you're going to be on a secondary channel."
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.460]   Which is the essence of net neutrality.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:39.460]   The essence is you have some net neutrality in the US of some sort that's being challenged as well,
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.460]   but in Europe they basically don't.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.460]   And so the telecoms see an opportunity here.
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:48.460]   So right, so they may not, you know, Russia may not take over the Internet and change what can go over it.
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:56.460]   But bit by bit, piece by piece, bits, if every bit is created equal, and if any bit is detoured, stopped,
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:00.460]   terrified, anything, then no bit can be presumed to be free.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.460]   That's the essence of what makes the net the net.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.460]   Yeah, this is against an open Internet.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:08.460]   It's the European Telecommunications Network Operators Association, or net no.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:18.460]   They're 41 European telecoms, and they want their members to receive "fair compensation" for things like YouTube and Netflix.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:19.460]   Don't you love that word?
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.460]   Fair.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:25.460]   The UK has been going after Google on, of you don't pay your fair taxes.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.460]   Well, we pay what's legal.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.460]   Well, yes, it's legal.
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.460]   You're right, it's legal, but it's immoral.
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.460]   You should pay more.
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:33.460]   Fair, fair is the word like creepy.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:37.460]   Actually, I don't think you should worry about Google or Netflix.
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.460]   They can afford to pay.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:40.460]   I mean, they don't want it, but they could afford to.
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:48.460]   But it really impinges on us companies like ours, where we would like equal access to you so that you can listen to our audio and watch our video and see our streaming.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:58.460]   And if we had to pay Comcast and AT&T and Verizon and Telstra and Orange and everybody down the line for access to you, we'd be out of business.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:03.460]   So a free and open Internet promotes the kinds of stuff you're listening to and watching right now.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.460]   That's important.
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:13.460]   And on the tax end, too, if suddenly you had governments coming after you, you should be so rich as to have them coming after you.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:22.460]   Well, I'm not using the Irish sandwich or the Dutch loop or whatever all these tricky little, I'm not big enough to do that yet.
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:28.460]   But nonetheless, at some point, someone may argue, and I don't want to, you know, want this kind of a bag, that you're making money off people watching you in other countries.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.460]   Ergo, you should pay these other countries money.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.460]   And the Internet just can't operate that way.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.460]   It's precious and it won't.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:42.460]   Should there be some sort of regulatory body, though, that's outside of all government, you know, purview that can be used to be a big deal.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.460]   Per view that kind of oversees this kind of thing.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:48.460]   Well, that's what I wonder, you know, until recently it was the US Commerce Department, right?
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.460]   Right.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:54.460]   And through ICANN and IATA, IANNA before that.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:09:01.460]   But it wasn't, I mean, it was only governance in terms of domain names and IP addresses and who gets what.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:02.460]   Mm-hmm.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.460]   Do we need to govern the Internet?
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.460]   And how would that be?
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.460]   Well, anyone can claim sovereignty over the Internet.
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:08.460]   The Internet is not the Internet.
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.460]   Period done.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.460]   It can't be.
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.460]   I agree.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.460]   It's not an architecture.
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.460]   It's a free and distributed architecture that is protein and will change.
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:18.460]   And if you try to lock it down and believe you know what it is, then you're going to have that problem.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.460]   A lot of this talk is symbolic, right?
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:37.460]   The China People's Daily, in fact, I tried to send this link to you when you were on Twitter on Sunday, was arguing that that, in this ITU thing, that because we in America control all these domains and things, we control the net and it's part of our propaganda war against the world.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.460]   So it's being paid that way.
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:40.460]   But the truth is we don't control it either.
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:46.460]   All we've done so far is to do a surprisingly good job of protecting it from control.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.460]   And that's what our role has been.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.460]   But I can understand if you're another cut.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:55.460]   Now, of course, Russia and China want to control the Internet in a way that actually keeps their people from seeing information.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.460]   I'm sure Egypt and others would like to do the same.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:09.460]   But I can also understand that Great Britain or France or Germany or somebody that wants free Internet access worries about U.S. control of the Internet.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.460]   I mean, we didn't invent the Internet.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:13.460]   We invented TCP/IP.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:18.460]   But, you know, Tim Berners-Lee, a Britain Switzerland invented the worldwide web.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.460]   And this is a global phenomenon.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:20.460]   I bet the U.K.
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.460]   Let's take the U.K. on for a moment.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:25.460]   Number one, people are getting arrested for jokes they make in Twitter there.
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:35.460]   Number two, there's a huge 2,000 page report coming out tomorrow that's going to argue, reportedly, the Levison Commission, out of all the Murdochsons, is going to argue to regulate the press.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.460]   Well, who's the press?
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:38.460]   We're all the press.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:41.460]   So you don't have a First Amendment there.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.460]   You do here.
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.460]   There's a preeminence of speech here.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:49.460]   I've started reading a wonderful book and I'll forget the title of it.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:56.460]   It's a Canadian sociologist who's done field work with geeks in San Francisco.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.460]   And it's kind of wonderfully perfect.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.460]   And she, I'm trying to call it up here if I can get it fast enough.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:08.460]   But she talks about the competition of speech, coding, freedom, ethics and aesthetics of hacking.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:12.460]   I, Gabrielle Coleman, and it's wonderful so far.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:22.460]   But there's a war of speech versus copyright, of speech versus privacy, of speech versus decency, of speech versus government control of things.
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.460]   And the one thing about America is we've got a First Amendment.
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:30.460]   And to me, that's a necessary protection for what the net is.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:33.460]   I agree.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:39.460]   But I also am somewhat sympathetic of other countries who are fear American hegemony.
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:44.460]   Oh, you just got brainwashed when you were out with those odds.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:51.460]   Well, I mean, I'm not impressed with how Australia or Germany or France are handling the Internet either.
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:52.460]   Right.
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:53.460]   So that's the problem.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.460]   I think, no, you need some basic engineering regulation.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.460]   And that's, frankly, that's what the ITU is supposed to do.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.460]   Yep.
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:03.460]   The IEEE, which is some basic engineering regulation.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:07.460]   So you have an agreement about what an IP address is and how that works.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.460]   Stay with, stick with that.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:10.460]   That's it.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.460]   Right.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.460]   I mean, that's kind of what I was talking about.
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:15.460]   It seems like this shouldn't necessarily belong to any one government or anyone.
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.460]   Certainly governments have sovereignty.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.460]   They can shut down things.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.460]   China does that, right?
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.460]   Right.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:27.460]   I think that there needs to be kind of a governing body or an agency or an organization that protects
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.460]   the Internet, right?
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:32.460]   That protects, puts forth standards and says, look, this is what it means.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.460]   And this is, we're going to protect this.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.460]   Should it be the United Nations?
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.460]   But I don't know who else.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.460]   There is no other multinational agency.
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.460]   Right.
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.460]   I don't know.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.460]   Why does it happen?
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:43.460]   Okay.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:48.460]   What's so, so, so, so, back order this, you know, build this from the end.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:53.460]   Is there any regular, besides ICAM, what regulation is needed?
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:56.460]   What's the harm that comes if there isn't a body, right?
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:05.460]   The Internet is a protein beast that manages to work as long as we agree to TCP/IP and DNS.
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.460]   Right.
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:08.460]   So what else do you need?
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:13.960]   Well, I'm thinking there could be some things that come along, you know, if there's hackers
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.460]   or whatever, somebody's taking advantage of something.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:20.460]   You know, there could be something that you want to put in there that says, look, you
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:23.460]   know, it's just like any other community, right?
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:27.460]   I mean, you say, look, community members don't do these things to other community members.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:31.460]   I mean, and so I'm not saying that it should be regulated in that way, but really it should
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.460]   be protected for everyone is kind of how I'm thinking of it.
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:37.460]   And it doesn't even have to be an international, or official international body.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:42.460]   I mean, why can't we set up something with memberships from all over, you know, people from all over
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:47.460]   the place that have, that people agree have goodwill towards getting this done?
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.460]   Yeah, but here's the thing.
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:54.260]   I don't, you know, I call, in public parts, I call for a discussion of principles of what
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:55.260]   we're trying to protect in the net.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:56.820]   I think it's an important discussion to have.
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.980]   I absolutely agree with everything you're saying in that sense.
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:03.900]   But in the end of the day, I never want to have a constitutional convention of the net.
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.940]   I never want to have a constitution of the net.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.620]   I don't want to have a legislature of the net.
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:08.780]   I don't want laws of the net.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.780]   Because we don't need it.
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:10.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:15.580]   And because once you have that, then someone has exerted control over the net.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:19.380]   The fact that the ITU has had control over the net, this is not new.
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:23.860]   So people are saying, oh, the ITU, but they've always had the International Telecommunications
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:24.860]   Union.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:31.300]   They were formed in the 20s, or maybe no, 1890s to regulate the telegraph system.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.460]   They've always had some control.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.460]   That's an engineering tool.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.380]   What role do they have over the net?
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.380]   The internet.
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:39.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.380]   What kind of control?
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.380]   The internet today.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.380]   Telephone system, yes.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.380]   Telephone numbers, yes.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.300]   I think they control protocols.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.780]   No, because I can't.
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.780]   Do they not?
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:48.780]   It's not.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:49.780]   I can't.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.780]   It's not.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.780]   Well, I can't merely assign numbers.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.420]   Signs numbers, right?
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.420]   I know many protocols are determined.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.860]   I don't know what the ITU's role is in the internet.
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:14:59.860]   That's real.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:00.860]   What the...
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:01.860]   What the...
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.780]   That's the ITU.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:07.900]   Part of the problem is that the ITU works in secret.
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.540]   And it's heavily influenced by telecoms.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:13.900]   And so they're probably not the people you want to run the thing.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:22.940]   But so for instance, who says the IEEE or the W3C should have a domain of this?
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.380]   Is it just by convention?
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:28.540]   It's just the other engineers go, "Okay, yeah, let this DCPI thing is good.
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.540]   Let's do that."
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.540]   I think so.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:34.220]   I think a group of people say, "Hey, look, this is great, but we need to organize this
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.220]   somehow.
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.980]   So let's develop this organization."
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:41.980]   So maybe it is a grab of power grab from the ITU.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.340]   It is an attempt to grab indeed.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:52.060]   But again, one other story I read says that the ITUB, the UN body of consensus, that we
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.060]   have the EU.
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.060]   Yeah, it's so as WIPO.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:59.940]   I mean, the problem is that they're heavily influenced by big money incumbents.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:00.940]   Yes.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:05.300]   But we have to constantly try to throw light on them.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.300]   And no one's allowed into these rooms.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.980]   Ironically, Google is a big money incumbent.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.820]   But they're worried about it.
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:18.340]   That was the argument that's being made in Germany right now is that Google is haughty
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.500]   and uppity and acting like it is the internet and protecting the internet.
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:22.500]   And it's not the internet.
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:23.940]   Well, right, it's not.
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:24.940]   I absolutely agree with that.
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:28.420]   But show me somebody who's doing a better job of protecting this point from the likes
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.700]   of you, media in Germany.
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:37.260]   Three days ago, the European Parliament voted in favor of a strongly worded resolution
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:42.540]   that calls upon member states to fight any expansion of international regulations of
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.460]   the US will also veto anything.
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:47.740]   So there's no present danger.
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:54.340]   There is an ongoing danger and right, just well, we should be aware of it.
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:17:00.740]   And we won't know what's happened behind the closed door.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:06.540]   The problem, and we'll see, this December 3rd through 14th in Dubai.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.700]   It's that long?
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.300]   Jesus, what are they have to talk about?
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.660]   That's the world.
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:15.140]   It's the World Conference on International Telecommunications.
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:19.140]   I mean, you've got to have some agreement about how the phone system works.
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.860]   And then similarly, you have to have some agreement.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:24.820]   I would presume about how border gateway protocol works, right?
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:30.340]   I mean, maybe it's the engineers that do that, but in an ad hoc way.
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.340]   It's not broken.
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.260]   Well, here's the other great thing about this.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:36.260]   We talked about this last week.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:40.380]   That now Google is not only making phones, but it's rumored to be in a deal with or talking
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.300]   about a deal with this to become a telephone company.
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:49.460]   Yeah, I don't know if I believe that, but I want to believe it, definitely.
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:52.300]   But we know dish is doing that.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:56.140]   They're creating an LTE based telephony, to net telephony system.
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:58.820]   We don't know if Google is being, it's talking about that being provider.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.780]   But the only point at the end of the day is that the phone becomes the afterthought.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.780]   It's merely avoidance.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:05.860]   It's all VoIP, right?
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:09.820]   So again, the reason the ITU becomes rather irrelevant.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:10.820]   Right.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:16.260]   So when is a, one thing Google's not doing is buying Icoa wireless.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.580]   I was just appointed.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.580]   I wanted to buy it.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.020]   That was this, this is the strangest.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:27.460]   So PR web, which is a press release service, you pay them thousands of dollars to distribute
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:29.420]   your press release.
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:34.700]   And Danny Sullivan has such a great article on search engine land titled, How PR Web Helps
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.860]   Distribute Crap Into Google and Other News Sites.
[01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:42.740]   Yeah, this is a really good piece that made me feel like I never, I don't trust any sort
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:48.100]   of clearly republished news stories ever again.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:52.460]   It's just, I mean, he actually does some searches both on Google and on Bing.
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:57.820]   He uses as an example a press release that comes out every month on PR web.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:01.620]   I've always thought the Google news was wrong to put press releases into the same feed as
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:02.620]   news stories.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:09.180]   Now Google would argue that, that if you don't have access to the press, your company, one
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:11.540]   way you get a message out is by using press releases.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.660]   And they're labeled clearly press releases, aren't they?
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:17.660]   They are, but they kind of show, I mean, you know, the argument is how savvy is the public
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:18.660]   and so on and so forth.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.540]   In this case, it ends up on Google news.
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:21.540]   It ends up going around.
[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:22.540]   They're not necessarily.
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.180]   But here's the interesting point.
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.900]   It's not just Google news.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.340]   The Houston Chronicle.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:28.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:35.340]   Also, publishes this press release and it's business press releases section.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:39.420]   And then it becomes a news source in Google news.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:46.020]   And he's, and Danny shows us very clearly how this Viagra site, this drug site, gets
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.180]   its press releases into Google news searches.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:53.220]   So why is, why is this getting reprinted?
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.980]   Is PR web paying?
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.380]   No, it's a chronicle apparently.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.380]   What it is.
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.380]   Go ahead.
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:04.180]   That, that, you know, a newspaper site basically doesn't have a business section anymore.
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.820]   PR, what becomes a long, says, you know, we've got all this stuff.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:07.820]   People can search for it.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:08.820]   It's there.
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:12.940]   It's announcements from companies, you know, put it up and it's good for PR web or PR wire
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:16.860]   or any of these, these companies because they want distribution of the PR.
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:21.060]   The PR entity, you know, any old company that hires a PR person or writes a press release,
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:25.180]   which is 99.9% of this says we want audience for this.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:26.180]   The newspaper wants some content.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:27.500]   Yeah, it's supposed to be clearly labeled.
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.500]   It's labeled.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.140]   And it's just more stuff in a section.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:31.140]   That's all.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.380]   So there's no, in permitture from the Houston Chronicle saying, oh, we've checked this.
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.940]   No, it says press release.
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:36.940]   It's pressure.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:39.460]   Nevertheless, Google news then runs it because it's from the Chronicle.
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.460]   I guess they could take it out.
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:43.260]   They could say, well, we're not going to index the press release section.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.780]   So the whole point of this was, it's a choice to do that, Leo.
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:51.260]   And I asked them early on and they said it's just another source of information that's
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:52.620]   out there.
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:57.700]   And you know, companies in an ecosystem of information, legitimate companies are more
[01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:58.900]   and more going to be expected.
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:02.900]   I saw Craig Silverman was was tweeting from some conference in the UK today about this
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:03.900]   kind of communication.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.740]   Companies are going to be more and more expected to put up reliable, timely, accessible information
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.860]   about their stuff and what happens with them.
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:14.380]   And you know, press releases about things like stocks and that kind of stuff.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:15.980]   It's the way they get it out.
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:19.340]   So you know, as a journalist, I of course looked down my nose at press releases and
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:25.620]   flax, but if you just talk about information out there in the sphere, it's not necessarily
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:26.620]   noxious.
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:29.420]   It could be, here's a product, you know, we don't have this show all the time.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:33.460]   We want to see the original company's product release information or other stuff.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.460]   It's okay.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:36.540]   It's when somebody games the system.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:42.060]   Well, in this case, it was stock market manipulators who wanted the stock of this company to go
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:47.620]   up by the phony news that Google had just bought it for $400 million.
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:52.060]   So they had incentive and they were willing to pay the thousand or $2,000 to get this
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:53.060]   onto PR web.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:57.220]   The question is, can't you back up to that money source and go after the money?
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.580]   Oh, I'm sure you could be.
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.580]   That's the problem.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:01.380]   They're PR was probably protecting them.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:06.100]   PR web's response is that they follow an internal process designed to maintain the integrity
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.380]   of the releases.
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:13.620]   But even with safeguards and any theft occurs, so they remove the fraudulent release.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:19.140]   But as Danny Sullivan points out, they apparently don't mind running this Viagra press release
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:24.260]   monthly from this fake online drugstore.
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.740]   So it really is interesting.
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:32.060]   Now in our chatroom, TV's Egon says that you can fix this.
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:37.620]   You can go to Google News and adjust the sources and take out a PR news wire and PR web and
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:40.900]   any other PR source from your Google news.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:41.940]   Just do it.
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:44.860]   So I don't know how to do that.
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.700]   Maybe he will tell us a whole.
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:50.220]   Yeah, maybe there's a way besides just doing the minus PR web.
[01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.540]   Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.540]   Just doing a minus.
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:54.940]   But that's not permanent, right?
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.980]   It's not permanent though.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:03.060]   Just sources, just the frequency settings, is that where it is?
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.980]   You know, but the fact is that he blocked it.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:05.980]   None.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.660]   Press releases right there.
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:08.660]   Personalize Google News.
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.900]   Reflect your taste in publishers.
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:11.900]   You have blog.
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:15.300]   There's only two categories you can turn off blogs and publishers.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.860]   Press releases.
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.260]   Hey, yeah.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:22.740]   So I'm going to remove press releases now for my Google news sources.
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.380]   Bada Bing Bada Boom.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:26.380]   Is that?
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:27.380]   Blogs.
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:29.260]   I think it's pretty funny.
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.100]   Those blogs can't trust them.
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.100]   Can't trust them.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.300]   I don't want to see anything from a blog ever.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.940]   You know, they should have a Germany setting where you also don't have any publishers.
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:40.260]   Then it's done.
[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:41.540]   No more lawsuits.
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:43.500]   Let's see.
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:46.900]   Any other stories before we go to our picks of the week?
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.580]   There's lots of patent lawsuits.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.140]   Ignore.
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:53.380]   That what's new.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.900]   You see, everybody's using Twitter now.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:57.780]   The FBI is using Twitter to look for securities fraud.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:02.180]   President Obama tweeted today saying, "Help, put pressure on your congressman to solve
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:05.580]   this physical cliff."
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.580]   I don't know.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:07.580]   I don't know if that's effective.
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.340]   One of the opponents immediately bought the keyword.
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:11.260]   They really bought the hashtag.
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.260]   Good.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:18.100]   Did you see that article that Mike Elgin wrote?
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:19.100]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.780]   Well, Facebook's, of course, in the news because they've changed their probably illegally.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:29.700]   I mean, the FTC, in part of the FTC's judgment was that Facebook had to have an open process
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.060]   on its privacy policy.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.700]   That's when they instituted the voting and all that.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:35.260]   They said, "We're not going to do voting anymore."
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:39.300]   Because only .03% ever showed up.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.340]   And the rule was that they needed 30%.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:43.180]   30%, 300 million people.
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:44.740]   300 million people.
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:46.500]   Come on.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.140]   Most of them are fake anyway.
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:52.580]   And dogs can't vote.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:54.860]   So yeah, understanding Facebook's monopoly.
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.980]   Anti-trust regulators says Mike Elgin are living in the past.
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:05.140]   Here's why Facebook, this is in Datimation, is technology's number one monopoly.
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.140]   I didn't read it.
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:07.140]   What is the thrust of that?
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:09.900]   Well, I haven't got through the whole thing yet, but I got through the first page.
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.100]   It was pretty interesting.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:14.740]   Basically what he's saying is he makes the case for why Facebook is a monopoly.
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:20.660]   And it basically comes down to the fact that Facebook has a monopoly on users because the
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:21.740]   users are there.
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:25.100]   He says, "Everybody's on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook."
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.060]   That's Facebook's monopoly on everybody.
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.060]   Right.
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.100]   And he says, "In the past, it's been for other reasons.
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:34.660]   He goes into document some of the IBM and Microsoft cases and why things were a monopoly
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:35.660]   in the past."
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:43.180]   He says, "In this case, Facebook's a monopoly because even though there's equal types of
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:47.180]   mechanisms out on other social networks, no one is going to go to those other social
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:49.380]   networks as long as Facebook."
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:53.940]   He basically makes the point that everybody hates Facebook.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.340]   Everybody knows their privacy is being violated.
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:00.460]   But he says, "When I suggest switching to a superior alternative, like I'm sure Mike
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:05.900]   is suggesting Google+, the response is always, "What can you do?"
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.580]   We put up with Facebook.
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:08.580]   I think he's got a good point.
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.140]   It is a monopoly.
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:11.140]   It's a de facto monopoly.
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:12.140]   It's a de facto monopoly.
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:15.940]   There are many other choices, which is why it's not actually a monopoly.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:16.940]   And that's the issue.
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:19.660]   They say this and I agree with them, but the law is the law.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:23.540]   You have to fit some legal standards before you can be declared a monopoly.
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:27.660]   And I don't think that those legal standards have caught up with what's really going on.
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:31.540]   There's Pinterest, there's Twitter, there's Google+, there's LinkedIn.
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:33.940]   Those all have significant market share.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:39.060]   So maybe it's spiritually a monopoly, but I don't think it's legally a monopoly.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.060]   It makes a good point.
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:43.980]   I mean, he says, "The highest purpose of antitrust and consumer protection laws is to, well,
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.460]   protect consumers."
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:47.180]   And he makes the case for that.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:52.340]   It's basically what needs to happen here is that consumers could be hurt dramatically
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.900]   if Facebook were to do something.
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:55.900]   We're seeing that though.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:56.900]   I mean, the FTC...
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:02.020]   Now, the real question is, is the FTC going to stand up and say, "Hey, wait a minute.
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:04.380]   You have an agreement with us that you will allow..."
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:05.780]   Actually, FTC tends to do.
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:06.780]   Yes.
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:11.100]   Yeah, because he says, "It's really all its best enforcement mechanisms is we don't care
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.260]   what you promise, but if you promise it and fail it, that promise will come after you."
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.260]   Right.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:16.820]   And then what else they do?
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:21.660]   That's pretty clear that, you know...
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:24.980]   On the other hand, you got to use Facebook because your family and friends are there.
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:26.260]   He's right in that regard.
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:27.260]   Yep.
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:28.260]   You can't not use...
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.260]   I tried, quit.
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:30.260]   I couldn't...
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.340]   I had to come back.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:37.180]   And so the answer to which I often give, and it's kind of flip of, "Hey, you don't like
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.340]   the Facebook privacy violations?
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:41.180]   Don't use Facebook."
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.180]   It's not a good answer.
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:45.180]   It's like saying, "Don't use your credit card."
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.180]   But you can't go after...
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:47.180]   You just have to...
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:53.860]   The FTC has to go after them and say, "You've got to improve your privacy issues."
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:57.180]   They are starting an external advertising network like Google AdSense.
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.180]   That'll be interesting.
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:02.540]   But this one will obviously use the targeting, the opportunities it has out of Facebook.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.540]   Right.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:04.540]   Elsewhere.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:05.540]   But that's not terribly new itself, right?
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:06.860]   The people in the city can creep out.
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:13.500]   When I go to Amazon and I look for, I don't know, a Chromebook, and then I go to sites
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:17.540]   elsewhere on the net, it'll show me laptops because it knows that.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:18.540]   So it's not terribly new.
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.980]   I know we're going to hear a huge cry about this.
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:25.900]   And if you're Google, you should start to worry because Facebook has much better signals
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.900]   in Google does.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:29.260]   Well, let's talk about that, do they?
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.820]   Do they?
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:38.020]   Google, he's waving his Nexus 4 for those of you listening.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:41.340]   Google has Android, which certainly is a signal generator.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:42.900]   Exactly.
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.900]   Google has your searches, which cares about what you care about more in life than things
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.540]   you're actually looking for.
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:51.020]   Google has your maps and knows where you are.
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.020]   Google has your Gmail.
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.020]   Email.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.020]   Yeah, that's a big one.
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:55.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:57.820]   If you started to add up, it would be really interesting story if you could start to estimate
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:02.580]   the data points, the value data points that were held by each company.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:03.740]   I don't know, Leo.
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:05.700]   I think I might still bet that Google has more.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:11.260]   Yeah, but if I'm a, okay, so I'm a guy who's selling toothpaste.
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:13.860]   And I want to buy ads.
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:18.100]   I could go to Google, buy AdWords, and they'll be on a lot of different sites.
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.780]   Or I could go to Facebook.
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:27.060]   Well, let's say to me, well, Leo, we can tell you age, demographic, we can make sure
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:32.380]   that a Facebook user, when they visit these sites, will get your ad.
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:35.260]   Do you think that Facebook has better targeting or Google?
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:37.020]   I think Facebook's got better targeting.
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.460]   Facebook hasn't shown it on its own site much.
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.460]   No, that's true.
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.460]   The Facebook ads are terrible.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.460]   Yeah, that's what I was just going to say.
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.180]   You don't have expertise that they're going to export yet.
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:48.540]   Now, you know, Google had to learn it too.
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:54.980]   But if you're, if you're all, I don't know, Dr. Zuckerberg, the dentist, Mark's father.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:59.780]   Yeah, you can argue, you can advertise on Facebook and find people of a certain age
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.060]   in a certain geographic area.
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.060]   That's true.
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.540]   I think you could pretty much do that with Google too.
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:09.100]   And you can probably find people on Google who are looking up things like dentures.
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:10.100]   Right.
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.100]   Mm hmm.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:13.100]   All right.
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:14.340]   Well, both of them are valuable.
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.340]   Yes.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:16.340]   Yes.
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:21.580]   And both of them are going to annoy the hell out of the rest of us because our dentures.
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.340]   Well, okay.
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:24.340]   Okay.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:27.100]   But how much irrelevance do you see now?
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.100]   Right.
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.660]   At least they'll be relevant.
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.420]   And they'll do it badly at first.
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:35.020]   They'll, and they'll irritate people and they won't be transparent enough and they'll
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:36.020]   be a human crime.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:39.700]   But at some point, they got to get better at it because otherwise it's not going to work.
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.260]   And if all it does is irritate you.
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:44.860]   Well, I guess this is the more park sausages mom argument.
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:46.900]   Another reference is going to mean absolutely.
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.100]   And that even doesn't even mean anything to me.
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:50.940]   It's called in the East Coast.
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:51.940]   This that I know.
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.940]   That I know.
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:53.940]   It's a commercial.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.940]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:55.940]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.740]   And is she annoying?
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:59.580]   Sausages mom.
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.740]   This is horrible, horrible commercial.
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:03.740]   Yes.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:05.260]   Where the kid would just shout it.
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.860]   You wanted to slap this little bastard.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:08.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:09.860]   Sounds good.
[01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:10.860]   Sounds good.
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:11.860]   Okay.
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:16.780]   But anyway, the argument at the time was irritating advertising works.
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:19.620]   Otherwise they wouldn't do it in a sales park sausages.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:20.620]   So yes, I guess I'm wrong.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:23.620]   In the better said, but I still think that when it comes down to trying to have a relationship
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:28.500]   with you of relevance and if all you do is irritate, then that's not going to work.
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.500]   Here we go.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:32.020]   More parks, Sausages mom.
[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:33.020]   That.
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.020]   Yes.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:39.820]   P-A-R-K-S, the please and the sassy.
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:41.820]   That is annoying.
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.820]   Wow.
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:51.220]   Now what if it were Robert Scoble saying it in your chat in your browser?
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:53.100]   That's going to be annoying.
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:32:00.180]   Or park sausages mom.
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:06.660]   I think we have to condition people to say really this to say to like these things.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:09.100]   Not I don't mean we, me.
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:14.100]   But I think if I were advertisers, the goal here is to say, look, you could have random
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:19.900]   ads for hernia things that you don't need or you can have an ad for something you really
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:21.900]   care about like park sausages.
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:22.900]   Right.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:23.900]   Right.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.900]   Which I think, you know, there are services that give you that choice.
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.100]   Number one, number two, it's about compelling creative.
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:33.500]   But you have to convince people that that's not creepy, that that's good.
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:34.740]   Yes, I agree.
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:35.740]   I agree.
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:36.740]   You do.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:41.620]   And the way you do that, I think, and the industry has not done that is by giving you
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.980]   transparency about what's being done, why it's being done, what benefit you get out of it,
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:46.340]   and some control over it.
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:50.700]   The idea to say, hey, I'm kosher enough with the park sausages.
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:53.420]   You know, is it important to control?
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:58.220]   And by the way, only gives park sausages the benefit of not wasting its money on somebody
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:00.340]   who doesn't want to eat meat.
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:04.700]   And instead, companies like Microsoft are throwing fun around about Google saying, you're
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:08.620]   going to get scruggled.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.300]   This is not helping.
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:15.260]   Microsoft is just is even though Microsoft is in exactly the same business with Bing,
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:20.180]   exactly the same business with Bing.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:27.660]   They are there by throwing mud at Google, they're they're ruining for themselves.
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:29.660]   I don't understand why they would do that.
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:33.260]   I think they're latching on to something that people have picked up on, you know, like,
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:36.660]   oh, I don't want to see all these Google+ posts and my search results or whatever it
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.060]   happens to be.
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:41.420]   And I think they're just latching on to that to say, oh, well, come over to Bing.
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:44.100]   Yeah, but then people will go to Bing and the same thing happens.
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.100]   Same thing will happen.
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:49.860]   Except it's from Facebook instead of Google+, and I don't see how they're doing anything
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:52.820]   differently at all.
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:53.820]   Even my own.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:59.500]   Like, even in you're going to get ads in both of them.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:00.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:04.420]   And, and so what they're doing is they're doing the exact opposite of what just said,
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:10.820]   which is educating people to the value of targeted ads versus saying, oh, it's creepy.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:11.820]   It's creepy.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:17.540]   You know, this is not quite the same, but, but, but I've noticed on, on YouTube when
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:23.580]   I'm watching videos and I have the chance to, you know, skip after four seconds or whatever.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:27.180]   More often than not, I'm watching the darn ad.
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:28.180]   I'm surprised at myself.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:32.180]   There's a fact that yeah, and you know, a lot of them, by the way, are Google ads.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:34.460]   You've been, you've been beaten into submission.
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:39.140]   I'd been hit those.
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:44.140]   Somebody sent me a link and I'm, maybe I can find it on my Twitter stream to a study on
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:48.500]   videos showing how impatient people are when they're watching video.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:52.660]   They don't wait more than a second or two and they'll click out of those ads.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.900]   If you've got a pre-roll boom, they're gone.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:58.340]   It was actually very interesting, but I don't know if I can find this.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.540]   Yeah, Conan O'Brien does that.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:02.860]   I don't know if you guys watch, if you go to Conan O'Brien's website to watch anything
[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:08.460]   that he does, boy, I mean, it's the same ad over and over and over in front of every
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:13.740]   three minute clip and it's just, I don't understand how whoever runs his website hasn't gotten
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:18.020]   the feedback that this is awful because people really want to watch the Conan content and
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:19.780]   they'll put up with that abuse.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:24.820]   Well, I think it's, no, I actually think that the problem is that when the web started,
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.660]   there were no frequency controls for ads.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:27.660]   Right.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:28.660]   So you got that.
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:29.660]   And what it meant was advertisers waste their money.
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:32.980]   What it really means is it's a very bad media placement.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:34.620]   That advertiser is wasting a lot of money.
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.620]   They don't want to be seen a hundred times.
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:41.380]   The first, they want a frequency control to be seen and number of times, probably just
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:45.300]   over the bar of irritating, yes, but not to the point of absurdity.
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:48.260]   Actually, this has to do with the quality as well.
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:52.220]   Users are willing to wait for no more than two seconds for a video to start playing with
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:55.420]   each additional second, adding 6% to the abandonment rate.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:56.460]   I like that.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:58.980]   The abandonment rate.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:05.220]   Users with good broadband connectivity expect faster video load times are even more impatient.
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:08.340]   Users who experience video freezing watch fewer minutes of the video than someone, well,
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:11.100]   that makes sense.
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.940]   So this is actually doesn't have to do with advertising, but I would, I think you could
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:17.700]   extrapolate it.
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:24.900]   This is the first large scientific study of how people respond to poor video quality from
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:29.940]   Akamai and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:34.260]   Inferring causality using quasi experimental designs.
[01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:37.500]   Now that's that science right there.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.860]   I wish I spoke science.
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.500]   It's written in the science language.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:44.620]   We're going to take, oh, I guess we don't need to take a break.
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:49.060]   We'll go right to your picks and tips of the week coming up in about seven minutes.
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:54.700]   We're going to talk about a new picture sharing site on triangulation.
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:37:01.860]   Our guest is was a tech crunch disrupt winner and we'll be joining us.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:07.980]   What's the name of the site that I can't remember, but I'll what is it?
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:13.220]   No, ever picks ever picks ever picks ever picks ever picks the founder of ever picks coming
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.300]   up on triangulation.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:19.180]   Let's start with the genus tip of the week.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:21.100]   This one is courtesy of Chad.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:22.100]   Thank you, Chad.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:23.100]   I was scrambling for a tip.
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.100]   You hooked me up.
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:31.660]   Geekmat, geekmat.blogspot.com does a post on how you can bookmark direct links to your
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:33.300]   multiple Google accounts.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:38.540]   So you figured out that there's in the URL, there's a, there's a number that corresponds
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.420]   to the order in which you signed into your account.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:42.700]   So if you've got two Google accounts, I know Jeff does.
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:47.300]   I know that if you was probably do, if you sign into your first one, your second one,
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:53.540]   there are direct links to your Gmail inbox, to your calendar, to Google Drive, which,
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:59.300]   which like for example, Gmail, it's mail.google.com/mail/u/zero for your first user.
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:04.100]   And then for the second user, user at slash one for calendar, it's off user equals zero,
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:06.460]   off user equals one, depending on the order.
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:08.380]   This isn't translating very well over audio.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.940]   You know, we'll have to put the link to this, to this blog post somewhere.
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:15.860]   This is really, this is really useful if you just want to bookmark direct links to your
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:18.540]   drive or your Gmail inbox for multiple accounts.
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:21.980]   The trick is you just sign in the same, in the same order every time you can go direct
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:25.420]   to it instead of switching in the user dropdown.
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:28.020]   So that's Geekmat.blogspot.com.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:30.820]   You can get those, get those links if you use multiple accounts, you want to add them to
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:34.820]   your bookmark, bookmark, bar, or, or save them elsewhere.
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:35.820]   That's kind of cool.
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.820]   It's a little tip.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:38.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:41.420]   So Jeff has a number of the week, Jeff.
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:43.860]   Well, I actually have to do this PR thing.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:48.740]   I had somebody who was saying that there are going to be fewer Nexus' sold than imagine,
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:51.980]   but it's on this site that says it's NASDAQ, but it's all these people who just put up
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:52.980]   their own links.
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:53.980]   So I'm not going to do that one.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.980]   Because we don't know how true it is.
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:56.980]   I'm going to be sensitive about this.
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:00.980]   So instead I'm going to do a one hour.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:05.300]   That's how long it took Martin Anderson to make a poster.
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:06.300]   Thank you, Martin.
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:07.300]   If you look at the right.
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:08.300]   Is there a postal way?
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.780]   You look at the right down in the chat.
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:10.780]   There's a poster.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:13.580]   Martin, you rock and you roll.
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:14.580]   That is awesome.
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:15.580]   Great.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:16.580]   Wow.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:17.580]   Oh, there it is.
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:18.580]   There it is.
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:19.580]   Hey, that's pretty good.
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:20.580]   Wow.
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:21.580]   That's very good.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:22.580]   Jeff Jarvis, Private Parts.
[01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:23.580]   It pumps the book.
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:26.620]   I think it's the book is public parts though.
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:27.620]   That's okay.
[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:28.780]   I'll take the intro.
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:29.780]   You should give that to Howard.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:30.780]   Yeah.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:31.780]   There you go.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:35.620]   The puppy is working on mine right now, which I so appreciate.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:37.180]   Martin, you are so cool.
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.180]   That is beautiful.
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:39.740]   Oh, that's a nice one.
[01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:40.740]   That is great.
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:41.740]   I got to talk to Martin.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:46.500]   He said he's going to send me the originals and a release form, which means we might be
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:47.500]   able to.
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:48.500]   It'd be kind of fun.
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:50.260]   Which means we can use it.
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:51.260]   Oh, cool.
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:53.260]   So we might be able to like make postcards for everybody.
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:55.260]   We could have some sort of.
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:58.300]   And they're vector images so you can blow them up huge.
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:00.420]   I think we should put them on the side of the building.
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:01.420]   Sure.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:02.420]   In every window.
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:05.060]   It'll look like we're a band.
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:08.660]   We are a band of brothers and sisters.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:09.660]   Does that.
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:10.660]   Anyway, I don't know.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:12.140]   My days as a newspaper columnist.
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:16.300]   The best thing to do is to be walking around town and you see your face on the side of
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:17.300]   a truck.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.300]   Feels good, doesn't it?
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.300]   Feels good.
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:25.300]   Actually, we wanted to put pictures of all the hosts in the lobby.
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:26.300]   We've got 20.
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:27.580]   What do at least it just told me 20.
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:29.780]   How many is it 24 outside hosts?
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:31.540]   How many outside hosts do we have?
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:32.540]   28.
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:34.180]   28 outside hosts.
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.140]   We're in house hosts.
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:37.700]   So we could put the eight regulars.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:38.700]   28 regulars.
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.980]   Put 32 pictures in the lobby.
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:42.300]   Just like the ice cream flavors.
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:43.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.300]   32 flavors of hosts.
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:45.300]   Wow.
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:49.100]   I think we each ought to have a handle beneath us with a different flavor of yogurt.
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:50.100]   Yeah.
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:51.100]   That's good.
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.060]   You can just like soft serve come over to our soft serve.
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:56.900]   I want to taste just Chef Jarvis flavor and then Leo flavor.
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:57.900]   Ooh.
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:40:58.900]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:00.900]   Am I going to wear a sweater?
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:01.900]   I think my flavor is sweaty.
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.900]   It's like sweat.
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:04.900]   Flops.
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:07.620]   I was about to say Gina would be mint.
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:08.620]   That's all right.
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:09.620]   She's mint.
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:11.220]   Jeff tastes like public parts.
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:12.220]   No butternuts.
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:13.220]   Butternuts.
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:14.220]   Butternuts.
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:15.220]   Butternuts.
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:16.220]   Is that even a thing?
[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:18.220]   Butternuts.
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:19.220]   Butterscotch.
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:20.220]   Butternut flavor.
[01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:21.220]   Yes.
[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:22.220]   Yes.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:27.060]   And that sounds pink butternut.
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:28.060]   I'm not going to do a tool.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:32.300]   I'm going to let Aaron take the take the load here and you got a tool of the week for
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:33.300]   us.
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:36.980]   It's called Smart Wi-Fi Toggler and I need to think lights actually came from Life Hacker.
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:39.820]   I saw it this morning in Google+.
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:41.260]   And I thought it was a really good tool.
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:45.060]   There are other tools that will do this but this one's really simple and easy to use.
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:50.300]   So Smart Wi-Fi Toggler basically what it does is it will automatically learn your Wi-Fi
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:53.980]   hotspot locations based on your network location.
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:55.820]   So not your GPS location.
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:42:00.420]   The whole idea here is to only turn on your Wi-Fi when you are near a Wi-Fi spot that you
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:02.020]   want to actually use.
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:05.860]   So it won't actually try to connect to every Starbucks that you pass or every McDonald's
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:08.100]   that you pass on the highway.
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:12.420]   And so it does this automatically and there's just a few simple settings you go through to
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:13.420]   -- That's great.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:18.060]   -- to set this up and then it will automatically start learning which Wi-Fi's you connect to
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.140]   where they're at.
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:24.020]   And then there's some basic settings that you can turn on and off like, you know, start
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:25.900]   -- there's a disconnect timeout for example.
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:31.900]   So when I'm away from this Wi-Fi for more than X amount of time, then turn off my Wi-Fi.
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:32.900]   And it'll do that automatically.
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:36.860]   Same similar thing with it will -- there's a trial timeout.
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:43.340]   So it'll tell how long it should keep Wi-Fi on when it suspects the presence of a nearby
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:44.340]   hotspot.
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:49.140]   So you can adjust that if it takes you longer to connect to your Wi-Fi at home, for example,
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:50.700]   you can adjust that timing and all that.
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:52.900]   So the theory would be to save you power, save you battery.
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.140]   It saves you battery, exactly.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:43:00.100]   And the fact that they did this without using the GPS sensor in your phone is really good
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:02.380]   because that's another big battery drain right there.
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:03.380]   So I don't know.
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.380]   I'm going to try it out.
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:08.980]   I just found this today thanks to Life Hacker and I'm going to try this out and report back
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:10.300]   and see how well it does.
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:12.740]   But I think it's a nice little tool for people to use.
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:15.620]   And this is where they have such -- Android developers have such an advantage because
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:17.580]   there's APIs and access to all this stuff.
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:22.820]   Whereas on the iPhone, I would be very shocked if there were API and access to this kind
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:27.420]   of information because Apple really kind of keeps this locked down for security reasons
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:28.980]   ostensibly.
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:34.780]   But that's the choice you make when you go to the Android platform versus the Apple platform.
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:37.380]   You get a little bit more interesting stuff.
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:38.380]   Yep.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:39.380]   Thank you, Aaron.
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.380]   Great to have you.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.380]   Yeah, thanks for having me on.
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:44.180]   Aaron, Newcomb at the Source The Source Show.org.
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:45.180]   The Source Show.org.
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:46.180]   The Source Show.org.
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:49.580]   But it's better just to go to Google+, and add me to your circles.
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:51.180]   A lot of people have been doing that lately.
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:57.660]   And that's where I really do all of my discussion about open source, Linux, Android, making
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:02.220]   stuff, especially if Raspberry Pi comes up quite often.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:03.220]   Are you a Raspberry Pi-er?
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:04.220]   I am.
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:06.300]   And I've got to bring over my project once it's done.
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:09.420]   It's a radio like the one -- there wasn't one behind us.
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:13.100]   But there's several radios from the '40s and '50s, little tabletop radios around.
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:16.660]   I'm taking one of those, taking the guts out, putting Raspberry Pi in.
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:21.380]   And when you turn it on, it plays old-time radio shows automatically.
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:22.940]   It just kind of streams them ongoing.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:25.860]   So you turn it on, you'll get something different every time.
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:29.180]   And why is your Google+ icon A+.
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.180]   I don't know.
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:33.860]   I guess when Google+ first came out, there was Google employees and others where the
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:36.100]   Google+ logo was like this.
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:37.340]   And I thought, well, my name's Aaron.
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.340]   I've got two A's in my name.
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:39.340]   So I'll do A+.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:40.340]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:41.340]   I like it.
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:42.340]   And I've been following you all.
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:43.340]   You know it is.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:44.340]   It turns out.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:52.340]   The Google+ squib now has the world's tiniest little number in it in the tab.
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:55.740]   In my Google+ tab, it has the Google+ logo.
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:45:00.660]   It now has the world's tiniest little number of how many updates you have.
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:01.660]   Where is that?
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:02.660]   Really?
[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:03.660]   In the favicon?
[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:04.660]   Yeah, favicon.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.660]   The title.
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:07.660]   Oh, right here.
[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:08.660]   Yeah, the hundred.
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:09.660]   No, no, no, no.
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:12.340]   I'm in the favicon up in the tab.
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:13.340]   Right, right, right, right.
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:14.340]   Yes.
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.340]   So that's not the favicon.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:16.340]   Oh, what's that called?
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:17.340]   That's just the window title.
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:18.340]   The window title.
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:23.140]   So mine says a hundred because I think that's probably as high as it goes.
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.140]   So it always says a hundred.
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:25.620]   That's how many notifications you have.
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:26.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:29.780]   Because I always have 99 plus, which would be a hundred.
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:30.780]   Yep.
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:31.780]   Of course.
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:32.780]   It's similar to Gmail.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:34.780]   It's just like my inbox.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:35.780]   24,000.
[01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:38.380]   I wish it would just stop after 10 or 20,000.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:40.700]   Just say, you know, you're never going to read that.
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:41.940]   So just ignore it.
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:43.340]   I was when I was in Australia.
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:47.060]   Somebody brought over a Raspberry Pi project that was really cool.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:52.860]   They took the docking station from the phone.
[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:54.420]   What was the phone that dock?
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:56.180]   Was it a Tiva?
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:57.180]   The Atrix.
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:45:58.620]   The Atrix phone.
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:02.420]   So remember the Atrix phone, which is an Android phone from somebody LG, somebody which would
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:06.340]   dock into a screen and a keyboard.
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:09.260]   Instead of having the Atrix phone, they had a Raspberry Pi.
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.260]   Oh, cool.
[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:11.740]   And they were running the OS and everything.
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:12.740]   That's awesome.
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:13.740]   It's really cool.
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:15.740]   There's a little teeny tiny.
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:19.700]   If you look on my Google+, if you scroll down a little bit, you'll see a little teeny,
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:24.060]   tiny arcade cabinet that this guy made with the Raspberry Pi.
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:26.260]   So it's only like six inches tall.
[01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:27.260]   There it is.
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:28.260]   The main cabinet.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:30.260]   I mean, it's really, really small.
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:31.260]   It's six inches tall.
[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:32.260]   See, we have a big, we have a big main cabinet.
[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:34.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:35.260]   I don't want just like that.
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:36.260]   I don't want just like that.
[01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:37.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:38.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:39.260]   Somebody brought that by, but this you could do it with Raspberry Pi.
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:40.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.260]   It's really tall.
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:42.260]   That's so cute.
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:43.260]   I thought that was awesome.
[01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:46.500]   It's the size of a cigarette lighter or two.
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.780]   Wow.
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:49.780]   That is really cute.
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:51.780]   I'd like to show you my...
[01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:56.500]   It has 128 by 32 OLED marquee along the top.
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:58.980]   Oh, that's crazy.
[01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:00.540]   That really is.
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:02.620]   I mean, it's incredible what you can do now with this thing.
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:04.260]   And it's only 35 bucks.
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:06.140]   Go buy one.
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:08.220]   And there's a main emulator for it.
[01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:09.220]   Wow.
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:10.220]   All right.
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:12.020]   Thank you, Aaron.
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:15.100]   Thank you, Gina, to your panties, smartawear.org.
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:17.100]   Think up.com.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.100]   Anything else you want to talk about?
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:20.100]   That's it.
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.540]   That's your detects, as always.
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:22.540]   And the maker of Etta.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:23.540]   The maker of Etta.
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.820]   It was a big launch.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:26.820]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:28.300]   She's recovering from that launch.
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:30.060]   She's still living in the makerspace.
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:31.060]   She's in beta.
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:32.060]   She is in beta.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:33.540]   Oh, she is in beta.
[01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:34.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:35.540]   We're all in beta, baby.
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:37.900]   You've made it for the next 20 years.
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:39.900]   Exactly.
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:40.900]   Maybe longer.
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:41.900]   Maybe longer.
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:44.740]   Jeff Jarvis at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:46.460]   Get his book, not private parts.
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:48.500]   That's Howard Stern public parts.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:49.500]   Thank you, as always.
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:50.500]   There it is.
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:51.500]   Look at that lovely book.
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:55.540]   It's available in better bookstores everywhere on Amazon and all that stuff.
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:48:01.660]   We do this show 1PM Civic, 4PM Eastern Time on twit.tv.
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:07.220]   That is 2100 UTC every wed this day, right after security now, right before triangulation.
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:08.900]   But you know, you don't have to watch live.
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:10.300]   It's fun if you watch live, and we appreciate it.
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:12.940]   And you can see the chatroom is a great help to us.
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:16.100]   So we love it if you're in there at IRC.twit.tv.
[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:19.580]   But if you can't, you know, on-demand versions or as a follower shows, an audio and video
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:20.580]   are always available.
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:24.420]   Best thing to do is subscribe in your favorite podcatcher.
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:27.260]   And that way you'll get it every single week automatically.
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:29.740]   You won't have to even think about it.
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:32.020]   That's at twit.tv.
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.740]   Triangulation's coming up next.
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:35.740]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:36.740]   We'll see you next time.
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:37.740]   Oh, can I guess?
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:38.740]   Can I have?
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:39.740]   We got to do the best of.
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:40.740]   Is that what you wanted to mention?
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:42.580]   Yeah, we're coming up on the end of the year.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:47.580]   And we want your input on what we should put in the video that we like to throw together
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:49.500]   when we don't do shows during Christmas.
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:51.700]   So, you know, Christmas is Tuesday this year.
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.180]   So the day after Christmas, we're not going to do one of this week in Google.
[01:48:55.180 --> 01:49:00.060]   So we'll go to, if you go to twit.tv/bestof, and you can, you know, just something you
[01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:05.580]   remember from this year that you really liked, Jeff Jarvis doing reggae, that would be a good,
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:06.580]   good choice.
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:07.980]   You should have been doing this all year.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:09.780]   Pick the show this week in Google.
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:13.820]   If you know the episode number, it says required.
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:16.180]   I think the episode number is, but everything else.
[01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:18.860]   No, I don't think we should, because people don't necessarily know.
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:20.500]   I don't want that to slow people down.
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.700]   The hacks in your audience will put in 0, 0, 0, 0.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.900]   Okay, they'll put some.
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:24.900]   All right.
[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:27.660]   Yeah, just put in 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, if you don't know it.
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:28.860]   When did the show air again?
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:33.380]   If I know you're not in time code, we're requiring time code.
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:35.380]   The hell have you got this up?
[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:38.380]   You could put in the middle or about at the end.
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:39.380]   Okay.
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:40.380]   You know, it says put it.
[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:41.780]   See, this is a barrier to entry.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:44.820]   I have not, I obviously have not vetted this.
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:48.700]   Let's put your answer in our colon minute, minute format.
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:50.540]   What the hell?
[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:51.620]   All right.
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:52.620]   You don't have to do that.
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:53.620]   One of our engineers could.
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:54.620]   Clearly, it's a hell.
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:56.700]   This is a programmer made us see.
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:57.700]   Yeah.
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:03.540]   Clearly an OCD programmer who didn't want to write the JavaScript code to validate it.
[01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:07.420]   So, and then, but just basically, all we really need is for you to pick a show and say what
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:09.740]   happened and somebody will probably remember.
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:11.620]   If you know the episode, that'd be great.
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:17.100]   You do not have to put your name in there either or your Twitter handle.
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:18.740]   It's only, I don't know why they did that.
[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:19.740]   Maybe we're going to have credit.
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:21.260]   We want people to submit.
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:23.100]   We don't want to scare them away.
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:25.780]   I thank God they didn't put a capture in there.
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:29.740]   Oh, and please solve this puzzle.
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.580]   Sign in with Facebook.
[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:32.580]   Right.
[01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:35.500]   You don't have to do any of that.
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:38.780]   Just with you, whatever you know, whatever you got, just fill it in.
[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:39.780]   What's your cloud score?
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:40.780]   Your cloud.
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:42.820]   You have to have cloud of 50 or more.
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:43.820]   Exactly.
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:44.820]   Exactly.
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.820]   I think, can we change all that stuff?
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:47.820]   Just take a picture.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:49.620]   The boss is back.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:50.620]   Yeah.
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:51.620]   Wow.
[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:53.380]   What a capture.
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:54.380]   Let's make it hard.
[01:50:54.380 --> 01:51:01.140]   I know why robots submitting to the best of you must be a human to submit.
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:07.300]   Twitter.tv/bestof and please don't be discouraged.
[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:10.220]   That's just a Google Doc so we can easily fix that.
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:11.220]   Yeah.
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:12.220]   Yeah.
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:13.500]   Just put it whatever you know.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:16.460]   By the time you submit one, it'll probably already be up.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:17.700]   It'll be all fixed.
[01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:20.060]   Are you sure you want to close this tab?
[01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:21.060]   Yes.
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:22.420]   And I want to close this show.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:23.420]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:25.100]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:27.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:30.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:32.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:35.420]   (upbeat music)
