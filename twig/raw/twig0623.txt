[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Jeff's here, Ants here, filling in for Stacey Mike
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.320]   Masnick from Tech Dirt.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.000]   We're going to get the skinny on why he has abandoned advertising and Google Analytics.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.960]   We'll also talk about disinformation and how to fight it.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.520]   Apparently Congress may not be the best way to do it.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.280]   If you pay me the glass door for influencers and a whole lot more, it's all coming up next.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.560]   A very special this week in Google.

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.960]   We cover the latest from the Googleverse and Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.960]   The townite.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.960]   Let me get the...
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960]   Oh no.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   Here we go.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.960]   This is the one fresh.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.680]   The Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the...
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   Craig.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   Craig.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.680]   Craig.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.680]   Craig.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.520]   Graduate school journalism at the City University of Newark, New York.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.200]   But we will do to appease millionaires.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.960]   I'll tell you on this show.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960]   You get warm.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.600]   There's a chair get more money when we sing Craig's name.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   Maybe less actually.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.720]   We're playing that exactly.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.200]   We missed you last week.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   It's good to have you back.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.360]   Were you out speaking or doing something?
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.360]   I'll tell you what happened.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.880]   I went down to see my father in Florida and he got breaks through COVID.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.280]   So he's in a...
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.640]   And you tweeted about this so I'm not giving away secrets.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.640]   No, no.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.640]   He's in a nursing home.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.200]   Well, he's in the hospital now.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.400]   But he was in a nursing home where all the residents were vaccinated but only half the
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   staff was.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Staff.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   Yes.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   Because it's...
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   He's not even nursing home.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   Instead of living.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   Because it's Florida.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.160]   And him, Instacart and Amazon, he was not going out at all for anything.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.880]   And they reopened the dining room.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.800]   And again, 97% of the residents are vaccinated.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.440]   The 3% who weren't probably don't even come down to dinner because that's probably the
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.680]   reason they're vaccinated.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.520]   But half the staff is not.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.840]   And he got it.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.440]   And he's in hospital.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   So it's serious.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   Hospital has to be there for days.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.880]   He's leaving Friday to go to the nursing care to get his strength back.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.240]   And he's deaf as a door nail.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.840]   Cannot hear a damn thing.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.040]   And he had one hearing and it wasn't working.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.120]   So when the doctor came and said, "You have to leave right now."
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   It's COVID.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.640]   So I grabbed a marker and a big piece of paper and I said, "You have COVID."
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.960]   And he looked up and he said, "How the hell?"
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.960]   Poor guy.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.480]   And it's just a perfect example of how the unvaccinated are victimizing not only themselves but vaccinated.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   Bingo.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.320]   I'm so sorry.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.400]   But it sounds like the prognosis is good.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.560]   He's doing pretty well.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.560]   It looks like.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   But we haven't been able to talk to him.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.440]   So I send him, because he's also losing his eyesight.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.200]   Of course, he's 95 years old.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.320]   So I've been faxing to the nurses station every night.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.520]   Messages in 36 point.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.960]   To tell him what's going on with him because he can't understand.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.280]   It appears that he's doing better not good.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.200]   And we'll see him live.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   95.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   Wow.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   All right.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.600]   Well, I understand why you weren't here and I'm glad you went down there to take care
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.920]   of business.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   Thank you.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.560]   So here, Aunt Pruitt from our hands on Hello, sir.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.080]   If you show Hello, Aunt, how are you?
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.560]   Unbelievable as always, sir, yourself.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.560]   I'm well.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.240]   You may notice that and is back in his house because in our county in Sonoma County, the
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.200]   state of California is not mandating masking.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.480]   But in our county, they are counties on indoor environments.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.160]   This county is and it varies.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.440]   And so we are masking up in the studio and we are also saying no more.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   You can't sit next to me.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.200]   How long did that last about three weeks?
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   We shall see.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   We were so close.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.120]   We were so close to normalcy and then.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120]   But that's it.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.400]   I got to tell you it's I think I've talked about it before.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.000]   I'm sort of used to the work from home environment in in mode of operation or whatever, but it
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   was nice to see my colleagues.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.920]   I know.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   You know, fairly well.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.920]   I know the truth.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.280]   I just wanted to use the coffee machine.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   I understand.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.280]   Okay, you got me.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.520]   That's the real reason he likes our espresso machine.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.720]   Hey, I want to be Stacy has the week off, but I'm thrilled to get we've been trying
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.120]   to get him in for a while now.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.920]   Mike Masnick of the fabulous blog.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.000]   Great to see you, Mike.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Good to be back.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.680]   It's one of the smartest observers of what's going on on the Internet.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.280]   If you don't read Tector do and let me put in a plug.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.440]   If you don't support Tector do, if you go to the insider shop, you'll see ways that
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.240]   you can support them.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.120]   And it's a particularly important now because Mike has taken a very principled stand on the
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.120]   blog.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.120]   I guess there's a little history needed here, Mike.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.920]   You want to set us up with this one?
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   Storytime.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.200]   It's principled by the way as a synonym for poverty, but keep going.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.720]   They usually code together.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.120]   Yes, yes.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.360]   Yeah, I mean, we had an issue last year.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.360]   And I actually, if I remember great, I think I was on one of your shows.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.360]   Maybe this one.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.840]   It was this one you talked about.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.160]   When what happened was we had ads on the site and a lot of them came from Google AdSense
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.720]   and we started getting very angry messages from Google complaining about various stories
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.000]   and threatening to kick us out of the program for really bizarre things.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Like they said, all of our stories about Google were dangerous and derogatory, which
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.600]   I'm sure was just some sort of automated system, but you could read that in a really, really
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.040]   interesting way.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.000]   And so we had pulled Google ads for a while.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.760]   Do you feel like just to put a pin in that one, but do you feel like Google was trying
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.400]   to censor you or this was some sort of automated?
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.760]   What was the automated thing looking for?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.120]   I think the real issue was our comments.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:49.360]   I honestly think that we have pretty open comments and despite what people say about
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.640]   open comments, I think our comments are generally pretty good.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.600]   We do have a few trolls, but they in some ways tend to be productive trolls and that
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.440]   they inspire thoughtful responses and conversations back.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.440]   And people who learn a lot from our comments and stuff.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.440]   Some of them.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   I want to say it's people who are fairly well, who understand the issues and care a lot about
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.840]   them because you really are the most astute observer of what's going on out there.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.240]   So I think you attract smart people.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.760]   So I'm not surprised your comments sections are good.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.560]   But sometimes people say bad things about Google.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   What is it they say?
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.440]   No, no, I think sometimes people use bad words.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.440]   I think honestly that's what it is.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.880]   People use like a lot of companies that sell advertising.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.000]   Advertisers don't want to be juxtaposed with bad words or things like that.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.560]   So they say, well, because this has bad words on it, we're not going to put ads on that
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   page.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.600]   Exactly.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   And I understand that.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.400]   I mean, one of the things that I write about pretty frequently is the impossibility of doing
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.280]   content moderation at scale well.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:04.720]   And you can see perfectly reasonable logic for how it gets there where some algorithm
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.400]   ticks off and says there are bad words on this page.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   Advertisers do not want to appear next to bad words.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.560]   Therefore we will not do that.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.040]   And if that was all that it was and if they just said we are going to remove ads from this
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.320]   page, we would say fine, no problem.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.680]   But where it got more and more tricky was that then they started saying like, if you
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.400]   don't fix this, then we're going to shut down your entire account.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.520]   But they won't even tell you what exactly it is that needs to be fixed.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.840]   It's just fixed this.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.200]   There is something bad on the page.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.640]   And basically I would go back and forth with people there and we would get maybe it's your
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.400]   comments, but we can't tell you.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.520]   And it was just getting worse and worse.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.960]   And so we finally just sort of dumped them last year.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.680]   And then we were trying to use some other ad partners and we explored a bunch.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.520]   When we first dropped the ads, we had different people reach out to us with different kinds
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   of solutions.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.880]   And what we discovered is almost all of them are really just reselling Google ads in some
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.920]   way or another.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:08.000]   And then what we had decided actually late last year was that throughout all this process
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.920]   we were getting increasingly uncomfortable just with Google Analytics as well, which
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.840]   we had used for many years as kind of the analytics package, it's sort of the standard
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.360]   free analytics package that everyone uses.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.960]   And so we just started exploring different more privacy protective analytics packages.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.720]   And there are a bunch out there and there's a huge range in terms of what they offer.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:37.320]   And so we installed a few of those basically in December of last year and we sort of ran
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.040]   everything into January and towards the end of January we said, "Okay, I'm comfortable
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.440]   with these other packages.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.720]   The two ones that we're using, by the way, I should plug because they're better."
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.400]   There's one called plausible and another called metomo.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.120]   And so at the end of January we actually pulled Google Analytics from TechDirt.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.720]   And then like February 1st, I opened up the page and I look and I still see it saying
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.920]   that it's calling Google Analytics.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.600]   And I was like, "How can this be?"
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.520]   We took Google Analytics off the page and we're trying to figure it out.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.880]   And we realized that because the new ad partner that we had just begun testing had Google ads,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.800]   it automatically shoves Google Analytics back into your page even if you don't have it for
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.000]   your own page.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.320]   It's to track the ad side of it.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.680]   And so that was a problem.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.520]   We sort of tried to deal with that and figure out if there were ways around that.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.720]   And eventually we just took all the ads off the page because that was basically the only
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.160]   way we could guarantee that was happening.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.200]   And then we actually found another, I don't even remember what it was, there was another
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.280]   thing that we had in our site that was also injecting Google Analytics into the page.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.200]   So we had to kill that.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.560]   And so basically where it stands now is we don't have Google Analytics on the page and
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.960]   we don't have any ads on the page.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   As a result.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.000]   And it makes sense that advertisers want to know how many people saw the ads.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.440]   So they're going to need to do some sort of analytics.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.280]   And Google Analytics is the default.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.000]   We use it too, I should say.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.080]   Actually, I proposed to our executive committee that we stop.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.400]   I didn't hear anything from them.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.280]   I might have to do that unilaterally.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.760]   What's wrong with Google Analytics?
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.480]   You know, I don't think that there's anything necessarily wrong about it in general.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.200]   You know, I actually think it is a pretty good package and it is free.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.320]   But there is a trade off there.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.520]   And that is that you are sharing the data of your users with Google.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.800]   Every single person who visits your site actually pings Google in effect.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   Right.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.080]   With just with their IP address, but Google's able to stitch that together with cookies
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.680]   that they might see or just information about that IP.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.800]   And so they're learning about it.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:49.400]   And whatever you feel about Google and I think of all the large internet companies,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.160]   I feel like they're the least of the evil ones.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.880]   But they are still a very large company and they do things that I don't always agree with
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.000]   and I frequently disagree with.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.800]   And it just began to feel uncomfortable.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.840]   And I started to say, you know, we don't have to give in to the same thing.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.920]   We don't have to give all of our visitors information over to Google.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.520]   And frankly, I know like a lot of our visitors use various, you know, blocking technologies
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.160]   to block the analytics and to block the ads.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   And we're fine with that.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.960]   You know, I know a lot of people get mad about it and say, Oh, you're stealing from
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.960]   me.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.880]   It's like, no, we were we always encourage people like, you know, protect yourself.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.400]   You know, we're fine with that.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.880]   But in the long run, if you do that, it might as well not take ads.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.320]   Because if your entire audience blocked analytics and ads.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.640]   And so, you know, it got to the point where we just said, you know what, let's just see
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.920]   what happens.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.720]   And you know, I feel better about the site when I'm not doing that to the people who
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   are visiting.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.040]   But how are you going to pay for your rent?
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.360]   I mean, how I mean, well, that's what we're working on.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.080]   So there are lots of ways that people can support us.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.480]   And I'm going to say, this is where you come.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.480]   Yes.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:09.840]   Just a few small monthly payments in the same boat, but we're in a very similar boat.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.160]   And I think we will be in the same boat in time.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.480]   And like your audience, our audience is savvy enough to not to use ad blockers, to not
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.480]   want ads.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.620]   Fortunately, because we're a podcast, you know, ad blocker works on the podcast.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.360]   You could skip over the ads is about all you could do.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.360]   And that's usually a pain.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.960]   People listen to the ads.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.400]   But we still have to do some sort of analytics for those ads.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.080]   And you know, we have to measure downloads at the very least.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.280]   So we're in a similar position.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.240]   And I totally understand why you would do this and respect it.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.440]   And I guess the message would be for people who are listening, this is going to be increasingly
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.440]   a conundrum for journalism and sites like yours.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.200]   And I guess sites like ours is how do we survive in a landscape where people don't want
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   to be tracked?
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   They don't want to add and companies are increasingly invasive with their tracking and advertising.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:10.000]   Was this easier in the newspaper day when it come to trying to gather analytics about
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.160]   the subscription base?
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.560]   Well, they didn't know anything.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.760]   Tell them about the ABC.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.400]   So in the audit bureau of circulation, would just verify that this paper was sold.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.760]   And then it gets worse and because then we had was called syndicated research more in
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.840]   the magazines than in newspapers where they would say, well, how many people saw this
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.080]   ad and it's pure BS.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.440]   They call it BS, hash it around rates.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   They would do a panel.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.840]   So, but I work with people magazine supposedly every copy of people magazine was seen by
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.240]   eight people because they would come public place in the doctor's office.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.680]   They'd count you looking at it in the checkout.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.280]   They'd count everything they could possibly supposedly count.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.280]   I do the same thing.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.840]   Just multiplayer downloads by eight.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   Everybody will be happy.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   I'm a good drink.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840]   I'm a good drink.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.840]   I'm a good drink.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   I'm a good drink.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   I'm a good drink.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   I need to use that.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.840]   A lot of podcasters do.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   This is another problem we have.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.800]   At least you had the ABC and the idea of the ABC or Nielsen ratings or arbitron was
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.600]   that there was a standardized system everybody used, but in podcasting.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.560]   There's, you know, people make up numbers and, you know, you hear Joe Rogut say, I have
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.320]   only five million listeners a month and you can't, there's no way that we can verify
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   that.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   It's made up.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.520]   So, and the other funny thing is that when, so the auto bureau circulation existed, sorry,
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.240]   Leo starts me going, you know, it's old time week.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   I'm going to talk about the old.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   It's his fault.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.240]   I know what I was doing.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.120]   I'm so glad to have you back.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.400]   The whole point was to verify your circulation.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:50.400]   Did, did in fact you sell 600,000 copies of the, um, product daily disgrace, right?
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.680]   Um, so then it comes to the internet and I will on the committee to decide what do we
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.320]   do about this internet thing.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.400]   And so the presumption was that advertisers would still want to know how many people saw
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.960]   your site as a whole.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.160]   And it took like three years before they realized no advertiser gave a damn about that
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.160]   because all the advertising cared about was the page upon which their ad appeared.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.600]   And they said, a lot of that, I don't care about the rest.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.200]   And, and, and the industry was just so high bound in its own ways.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.600]   And it was so much about bragging about size matters.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.600]   I have more people reading than you do that became utterly meaningless.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.480]   So the, what I always tell the students is the myth of mass media was that all readers
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.720]   see all ads.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.040]   So we charge all advertisers for our readers.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.000]   That's why a newspaper had everything that could cram in their bridge columns.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.200]   Who cares about a bridge column?
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.920]   Well, five people read the bridge column.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.920]   We're going to charge every advertiser.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.080]   We're charging the same amount.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   That's all they look at.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   Right.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.600]   So, so that's how the, the, the industry never kind of got their head around that.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   And we're still stuck in that.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.920]   So you have advertisers in their media departments that still look at things like total size,
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.920]   even though it's meaningless.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.720]   They could buy a bunch of small sites, a hell of a lot cheaper than buying the big sites,
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.240]   yet in the early days, they would sell out the Yahoo homepage because everybody wanted
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.880]   to be on the Yahoo homepage.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   Mm hmm.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   Lutifress versus the industry is stupid.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.600]   The media industry is stupid and we're paying the price.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   No, I'm not.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.200]   Mike is paying the price now.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:21.080]   So now there's this notion and it started with newsletters of the sovereign writer, somebody
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:27.240]   like Casey Newton, leaving a big name publication and starting his own sovereign newsletter.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:34.600]   I guess in a way, that's the one last hope for sites like Techdert is, well, if we can't
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.640]   and don't, but we choose not to deal with the devil will be supported.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.560]   And I mean, it's interesting, right?
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.840]   But I mean, this sort of, you know, sub-stackification, you know, of independent writers has been a
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.080]   really fascinating thing to watch over the last couple of years, certainly.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   And you know, there is this temptation to see if we follow that path.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.720]   The issue I have with that approach is that most of that really does kind of rely on a
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   paywall, right?
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.800]   I mean, the way you get people to subscribe is you do maybe like, you know, one free thing
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.120]   a week and then the rest is behind the paywall.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.600]   And I'm uncomfortable with that.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.440]   I mean, I think the part of the value of what it is that we're writing is how widely it
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.640]   is shared and how more people impact you have.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.760]   Impact you have is important and huge.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.840]   And what nobody talks about on paywalls, nobody from the New York Times down is the
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.560]   subscriber acquisition cost and the churn.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.040]   It costs a lot of marketing money to earn that money.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.920]   And then when people do leave because they do damn them, you've got to replace them and
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.200]   still grow.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.520]   And that's a huge cost.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:43.520]   And the subscriber, the total subscriber payments in the world are not many.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.720]   The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford calculated for me that in the US,
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:54.200]   63% of all new subscriptions go to three brands, New York Times, Washington Post Wall Street
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   Journal.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.000]   Everybody else splits the other third.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.400]   Well, I mean, it is interesting though that with some of these independent writers, because
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.160]   they have so much less overhead, they're able to make it work.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.520]   And I actually think that's great.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.440]   And I think it's kind of a really exciting thing.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.400]   It's a slightly different approach than what we would like to do.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.320]   We're focused on when people subscribe to the different things that we have, we try and
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.040]   give them extra features rather than locking away the content.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.640]   And that's kind of our focus.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.760]   But I think it's kind of cool to see some writers who are able to actually make a living
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.640]   this way.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.400]   And it is a different approach.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.560]   And it sort of has opened up people to that kind of thinking.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.120]   Like, I do want to support not these big giant brands, the New York Times, the Washington
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   Post or whatnot.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.240]   I want to support this individual writer who I like and I want to be able to continue
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.680]   writing and to also be able to eat everyone's at a while.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.840]   So, you know, I think there is something promising there.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.440]   I just don't like the paywall aspect of it.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.040]   And maybe that's just because I'm an old school-
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   Well, I think there's-
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.640]   The key to what you're doing and what Leo's doing that I prefer for all of media, unless
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.160]   you're the New York Times, the Washington Post Wall Street Journal.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.160]   If you can do it, do it.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.160]   Fine.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.160]   Hell, oh, yeah.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160]   Right?
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.480]   But it's not subscription pay for access to content.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.960]   It's membership.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.600]   And it's being part of something and supporting that something.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.560]   Because I like what you do because I want to be part of a project, because I want it
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.600]   to be free to the world, because I want the social status of saying, look, I'm sporting
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.080]   enough to read tech dirt.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.880]   Any of those things are the motives for people to support you.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.640]   Yeah, and there's a fundamental sort of economic thinking behind that too, which is that, you
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.160]   know, people will pay for something that is a scarcity, right?
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.320]   Something that is widely available is it's less easy to convince people to pay for it.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.720]   But if you think of it not as paying for our past content, but paying for our future content,
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.040]   our future content is scarce because it might not exist.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:58.680]   If we can't survive and if we can't stay around, then there is no future content.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.120]   So the scarcity that you're paying for is our ability to continue to produce amazing
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.720]   content in the future rather than the way I think most people who have a paywall also
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.920]   think about it, which is that you're paying for access to this content that I already
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.920]   created.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.920]   I love that.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920]   I'm going to make a note of that.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.760]   That's a really good way to position it.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.720]   I, no matter what we do, we will never do a paywall because it's anti-democratic, I think.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.920]   And we want the most, you too, I think the most possible people should hear what you have
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.920]   to say.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.480]   Any senator who gets sent a link of why you're wrong, Senator, about Section 230 should
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.240]   be able to go to that page without facing a paywall.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.560]   So we want to keep that going.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.960]   And I think that's really kind of what Ad supported media was all about is this kind
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.520]   of democratic medium that anybody could listen to.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.080]   How many people are you, Mike?
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.240]   I mean, if you've added up.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   Staff-wise?
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.240]   Definitely right.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.480]   Yeah, so it depends on how you count.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.640]   It's, we're four full-time people.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:06.520]   And then we have the writers or there's another four writers as well who are part-time.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.920]   Do you have an ad sales division?
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.640]   We have, you're looking at the ad sales division.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.400]   We have actually more people doing ad sales than you have in your entire company.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.960]   Yeah, we're small.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.320]   It's a big, well, it's just because that's what you have to do.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.200]   It costs money to earn money.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.840]   That's subscriptions, ads, membership, any of this.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.840]   It costs money to earn money.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.240]   You know, club Twitter isn't free.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.760]   We have to have a person manage it.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.520]   We have to have engineering devoted to it.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.400]   Our hosts have to vote time to it.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.400]   It is far from free.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.040]   You know, in fact, the jury's still out whether it's a net positive, really.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.000]   But it's too, I mean-
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.280]   I'm having fun with it though.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.280]   Oh, well, that's the thing.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.280]   It's fun to do.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.480]   I guess if it's just neutral, okay.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.920]   But that's, you know, it's hard.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.560]   It's really hard and it's getting harder.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:04.160]   And it seems to be, I mean, this is, maybe this is a natural cycle for media.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   I don't know.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.240]   But it seems to be this is what happened to blogs.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.920]   It has now happened to podcasts.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.920]   Is this shakeout?
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.680]   And then you get the acquisitions by big companies.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.280]   And then there really are only two kinds of blogs.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.080]   There are hobby blogs or blogs that are owned by big media companies.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.840]   And you and I fall in this crack between the two trying to survive.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.760]   It was the great future of media to have it truly independent media.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.040]   And this is what Dave Weiner has for-
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   God bless him.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040]   --instorting blogs and RSS.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.040]   Yep.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.280]   And I'm just really, I'm just boring.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.880]   Dorky, I am.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.240]   There's a book called, surprise, Goodbye Gutenberg.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.040]   Man, I didn't say it's a deep game.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   So-
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   Every book with Gutenberg in the title-
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   I think I do.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   This is written in 1980 about the changes in the news business.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040]   I won't bore you with it.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   Fear not.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.280]   You can keep watching, folks.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.960]   But it's fascinating to watch that every time a technology comes in, how it causes this
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:09.160]   kind of disruption and the big old players will try their damnedest to hold on to their
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   position.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   And that's what they're doing.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.480]   I think if you look at the history of radio, I understand it was something fairly similar.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   When radio first came about-
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   Absolutely.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.000]   Lots of independent people who just set up a way to broadcast.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.680]   And it might only reach down the street or whatever.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:29.560]   And then all the big players came in and crowded out all of the small independent ones.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   I bought them up.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   It's like funeral homes.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.280]   Oh, don't get started on funeral homes, okay.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.040]   And let me tell you about the history of funeral homes.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.040]   You know, in the early days.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.360]   No, it's easy.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.400]   This is the problem with all of our shows, but this show particularly is we're all kind
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.440]   of- there must be a name for it, the ultimate dillotons.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.800]   We want to know everything about everything.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.240]   Fascinated by all of it.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.000]   That's- we're nerds.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.040]   Let us talk about some Google news.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   How about- There's Google news.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.040]   How about that?
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   How about that?
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   How about that?
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   Talk stories.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   What a thought.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.040]   This week in Google.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.440]   What a thought.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.600]   Although I- well, okay, one more story from Tech Dirt.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.240]   There's lots of Tech Dirt stories.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.200]   There's some great Tech Dirt stories.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.920]   But there's one that I really enjoyed from today.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.480]   This was Mike's story.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:31.000]   And I just- I actually bookmarked one particular line in this.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.440]   Yes, actually the First Amendment does mean Twitter can kick you off its platform Wall
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.600]   Street Journal.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:42.640]   Mike responding to Columbia Law Professor and professional goofball, Philip Hamburger,
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.400]   who is continually misinterpreting what would seem to be-
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.200]   You're gonna get my suit again.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.640]   I call him a goofball, sir.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.960]   Mike was very nice.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   He seems to be a little-
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   That wasn't bad nice.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.480]   Coolness about the subject matter.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   He seems to be teaching.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.600]   Well, you said you felt bad for students at Columbia Law School.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.400]   So that might be problematic.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.840]   My favorite line, though, is you're talking about this editorial he wrote in the Wall
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.520]   Street Journal.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:19.960]   And basically his argument, I guess, is that the First Amendment- he tries to argue the
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.440]   First Amendment doesn't protect website content moderation choices.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.640]   It's just a very convoluted article.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.320]   But you write, "If the Wall Street Journal really believes this nonsense, why won't it
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.000]   let me publish my op-ed in their pages about how the Wall Street Journal is the worst
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.600]   newspaper ever and regularly puts lies and nonsense to please its scheming owner in his
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.280]   hatred of the internet."
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.120]   This is why we love you, Mike.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.040]   I'm being censored by Rupert Murdoch.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.120]   Clearly, something must be done.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   No, punches.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.120]   We'll be pulled.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:58.280]   I mean, they don't let me print my articles in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   How dare they?
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.600]   That's a violation of my first amendment.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   That's my first amendment.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   Right.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.320]   So according to the Wall Street Journal, so, you know, I'm just taking their argument to
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.680]   its logical conclusion.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.280]   It is a very complicated, convoluted argument that hamburger makes, by the way, I love that
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   his name is hamburger.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.920]   He's probably pronounced it "hambergé," I'm thinking.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:30.960]   "A hamburger basically says it's violating federal laws against discrimination to block
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.680]   the president of the United States.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:40.040]   It's discriminatory, of course, he's not exactly a protected class, unless rich billionaire
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.360]   politicians is a protected class.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.360]   Maybe it is.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.920]   I don't know.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:50.480]   It's a very interesting attempt to make sense that makes absolutely."
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:56.280]   The thing, too, I mean, I was mocking different aspects of it, but honestly, the article was
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:04.680]   written in such an amateurish way that it does not read any law professor I've ever met
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.840]   wrote it.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:12.280]   It really reads like somebody who has just discovered the internet and is mad and has
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.520]   written this article without understanding any of the underlying law.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.480]   It's the same kinds of arguments that I think I said something in the article that it reads
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.000]   like some random Twitter account.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.520]   You certainly might.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:30.560]   Maybe there's a co-author, a former Trump DOJ official who's now a policy analyst at a
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.560]   DC think-tank.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.560]   Yeah, it was she.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:38.840]   There were two bylines on it, and the other one is a former Trump DOJ official who's now
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.280]   like a policy analyst at some think-tank.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.560]   My guess is that she wrote most of it.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.480]   I don't know.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.160]   They're both named on it, but the writing is just not good.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:59.080]   Just from a purely, how do you write an article standpoint?
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.160]   It's all over the map.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.240]   It's not clear.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.840]   There's this one, all of a sudden, it throws in a copyright issue in the middle where it
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.520]   says that Google benefits too much from fair use, and therefore it's like privileged by
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.040]   the government and no longer a private company.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.800]   I mean, it's no sense.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:23.160]   If you wrote a paper in law school with these premises, you would be flunked.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.680]   Yes, I guess except in his class.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.160]   Well, I'm going to, I'll say, what's very obvious at this point to me is that this nonsense
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.960]   is not aimed at you and me.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.680]   It's a shame it's showing up now in the Wall Street Journal, but it's been showing up on
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:46.320]   the nation's airwaves for years, which is basically a polemicized arguments that have
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:51.360]   no relationship to fact, but don't require it because the audience it's intended to
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.280]   don't have a ground or basis to understand it.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.680]   They just want to hear stuff that confirms what they believe.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.840]   This stuff works very well.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.880]   This stuff is very effective.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.760]   It's the reason you can lie through your teeth about all sorts of things that are for the
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:13.800]   rest of us obviously lies, but for the audience for whom it's intended, it's gospel truth.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.240]   You could say the January 6th in Sureshjur was a bunch of very peaceful people who were
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.960]   just touring the Congress.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.600]   And, you know, when I look at the videos and go, well, that's obviously not true, but
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.400]   for the audience for whom it's intended, it's gospel.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.680]   And that's what this is.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.120]   This is not intended for you and me, Mike.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.680]   I'm sad to see that in the Wall Street Journal, but I'm not surprised.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   I'm not surprised.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.320]   Well, I mean, at least a special webpage.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.320]   I mean, the Wall Street Journal, you know, opinion pages, you know, have become that kind
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.320]   of thing.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.600]   And it's, it is more targeted also at, you know, officials in Washington and to make
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.880]   this argument, to make them think that there is some sort of legitimate argument here when
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.240]   there's clearly not.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.600]   It gives them cover.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:04.320]   I don't, I think, I think most of the people who read the Wall Street Journal, most people
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   in, I would hope maybe I'm, maybe I'm a fool.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.300]   I would hope the most people in the government who read this know better and even Philip
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.480]   Hamburg knows better, but that's not the point of this by any means.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.720]   You know, this isn't for them.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.280]   This is to give them cover, to give them argue, you know, points so that Jim Jordan can go
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:28.080]   out and try to get into jail and see the insurrectionists, make sure that they're not
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.920]   being mistreated, like the good patriots that they are.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.120]   It's just, it's, we live in a very different world, you know.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.160]   And I'm, you know, I'm glad that you have the fortitude.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.120]   I'll tell you this, the fact that you have the fortitude to call out this BS when you
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:50.840]   see it gives me courage because it's very, any, well, no, seriously, anybody who's in
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:57.440]   through my position or anybody who's a broadcaster is always fearful of saying what I just said,
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.400]   because there are, there's some percentage of people who are watching who will no longer
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.080]   listen to show ever again.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   Because we challenge their fundamentally held beliefs.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.240]   And that's risky.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.880]   And if you're in mass media, you're trained.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.080]   Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, we don't have enough numbers to begin with.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.200]   Don't produce them.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.000]   I gave up about that about, you know, when Trump first got elected, we were, we tried
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.240]   to be fairly judicious.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   You tried.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.640]   I screwed it up about two or three years in.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.520]   I was like, oh, screw it.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.760]   Yeah, you did change.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.000]   You just suddenly changed.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.800]   We tried not to, but at some point, I didn't want to get political, but it gets to the
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:39.360]   point where when people, when there's outrageous lies being told, you can't turn your back
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.360]   on that.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.680]   I mean, yeah, if your focus is on the truth, then you have to focus on the truth, right?
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:50.080]   And so, you know, we criticize people across the political aisle, but, you know, when,
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.360]   when one party has completely detached itself from reality, then you have to call that out.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:01.600]   And, you know, I criticize Democrats all the time as well, but it's their, their commitment
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.560]   to the truth is a little bit closer than the Republicans right now.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.360]   Well, yeah, that's unfortunate.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.040]   And I try, I bend over backwards not to make it a partisan issue and just say, well, there's
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.880]   some people who are really clearly liars and thieves and grifters and there's some
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.320]   people who are not.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.000]   And it's not necessarily to split down party lines.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.360]   But when somebody's a lion, you got to say, hey, that's not true.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:33.680]   And when somebody, when a law professor writes in the Wall Street Journal that somehow the
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:39.640]   First Amendment doesn't protect Twitter against the government or somehow the Google is, is
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.000]   the government just, you got to say something.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.520]   You just can't let that sit.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   And you know what?
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.320]   Maybe you and I are paying the price for that.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.320]   Yes.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.240]   You know, I'm currently being sued for defamation too.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.120]   So Lord, it's so sorry.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:00.040]   It's so kind of, you know, these things, these things happen.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.760]   So it's, it's been, it's been quite a year.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.960]   Oh, the tech dirt.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.680]   I almost, I almost, yeah, you don't, I, I verge on despair.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:17.640]   So I swear to God, Mike, thank you for hanging in there.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.640]   I'm doing my best.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.720]   You're keeping us in here.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.680]   Now let's talk about the Pixel 6.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   Woo hoo.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.800]   No, good old hardware.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.680]   This is, you know, and there's plenty of people who prefer that we just stick to that.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.720]   And I understand that.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:38.040]   And you know, for a long time we, we fought the good fight, but honestly, this all impacts
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   technology.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.480]   I mean, we're to this, this, this diatribe in the Wall Street Journal is, is going against
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   tech.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.360]   It's really the, the, the ad steer.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.640]   It's the big tech attack.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.680]   It's, it's the, which is, which is, go ahead, Mike.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.640]   I mean, and also, I mean, it, you know, if this actually did get anywhere and if people
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.360]   actually believed it and it moved into sort of, you know, courts and Congress and wherever
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.520]   else, you know, it, it is a clear attack on the open internet and all the stuff that
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.320]   we were talking about before, the things that we find important about having the ability
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:17.040]   for there to be some kind of independent media, that doesn't exist if these things go into
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   effect.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:23.360]   If people actually believe Philip Hamburger and his argument about how the, the First Amendment
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.440]   interplays with the internet, we don't have an open internet anymore.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.720]   We have a very locked down and, and a very proprietary kind of internet.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.280]   And that's not the internet that I want.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.560]   And this shouldn't be the internet that anyone, especially anyone watching this listening
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.040]   to this as an open podcast with, would or should.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   Exactly.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:47.400]   And part of what they're going after is to bring liability to anyone for anything so
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.720]   that the hell that Mike has gone through in a few cases becomes all of our help.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   Everybody can go through this.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.680]   I say that again and again.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:59.400]   Section 230 means that we can have a chat room and we can have forums and, and, you know,
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.640]   we can have people on our show.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.760]   If you lose section 230, I'll just be me talking very carefully.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.120]   I'll have a lawyer next time whispering.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.360]   I'm still a boy, you shouldn't say that.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.600]   One lawyer says, get rid of Jarvis first.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.040]   Oh, you'd be the first to go, Jeff.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   Are you kidding?
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.040]   I'm gone.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   No, answer the nice guy, but yeah.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.720]   I've only been in one lawsuit in my life and, and I will never, and I, by the way, I
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.720]   was a plaintiff.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   I was suing.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.960]   I will never, ever voluntarily do that again.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   It is.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.360]   Oh, if nobody's, if anybody's ever not been through a lawsuit and Mike, you've been through
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   several.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   It is awful.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   It's expensive.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   It's boring.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.720]   It's time consuming.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.120]   It's frustrating.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:50.240]   It's everything that you would hate bundled into one big hairy ball.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   Hate.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.240]   It's terrible.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.600]   So I, you have my deepest thing.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   I'm so sorry.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.920]   You have to defend yourself, right?
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.120]   And, you know, the thing that amazes me is that you have some law professors not talking
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.280]   about, about Professor Hamburger here, but other law professors who I think are serious
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.640]   thinkers or they, they appear to be serious thinkers who keep saying that if we change
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.960]   section 230, it's fine.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.720]   The courts will kind of sort it out and everyone can just, you know, argue things out in court.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.800]   It's just like, have you ever been sued?
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   No, exactly.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   Have you ever gone through this process?
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.520]   It is not, it is not the kind of thing where, you know, you, nobody wants to go through
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.520]   it.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.400]   And, and the pressures are all to, to sort of cave in, you know, and, and not to actually
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.600]   defend your rights because the, the cost of actually defending your rights and money,
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.520]   obviously, but also just in time, concentration, stress levels, you know, my blood pressure,
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:47.760]   you know, is, is so high and so extreme that, you know, it's really just not worth it for,
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.120]   for most people to go through that, that process.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.520]   And, you know, not that I'm doing, you know,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.720]   So the chill becomes arctic.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   Nobody, nobody wants to.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.720]   That's the problem.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.720]   It is a chill, absolutely chilling effect.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.360]   You just end up saying as with any repressive regime, you wonder why people put up
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.000]   for the repressive regime, just keep your head down.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.560]   It's the safest, easiest thing to do.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.680]   And, and even, you know, to be clear, because of that, it's not just the cases that go to
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   court.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   I mean, you know, without going into any other detail, I'll say that, that, you know, we've
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:21.280]   faced, I think it's four threats this year, some of which were fairly serious that we
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.720]   have to take seriously.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.960]   And that is time, attention, and stress.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.560]   And, you know, and we're willing to defend the decisions that we've made because we stand
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.560]   behind them.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.200]   But, you know, it's, the chilling effect is, is really significant.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:43.840]   I'm really fortunate because my business partner and wife, Lisa, her attitude is, we
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.840]   fight everything.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.280]   We, we don't settle.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.280]   We keep going.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   Even though it costs us more, almost always cost you more than to settle because, yeah,
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.280]   it controls everybody else.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.520]   They know exactly how much to ask for.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.760]   Just enough so that it's cheaper to settle.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.280]   But Lisa is a, is somebody who really believes in principle.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   She says, Nope.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   Never going to settle.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   It's a precedent.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   We're going to fight.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.720]   Cause I don't, yeah, I think that's the reason she doesn't want to settle.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.760]   Cause in the long run that, you know, then you're just flinging open the door.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.960]   Everyone says, Oh, they'll settle.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.960]   So we'll do it.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.680]   We'll get our, we'll get our fee.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.840]   And then that adds up.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.720]   So yeah, and a lot of times it does make sense to fight it.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.480]   Speaking of section 230, Amy Klobuchar, speaking of, you know, Democrats get it.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.880]   Wrong to sometimes.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   Yep.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:35.240]   And I think with the best intention, she's trying to shut down a vaccine misinformation,
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:43.480]   but she's introduced a bill that would affect carve out an exception to section 230 to allow
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:48.960]   people to take down vaccine misinformation.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   Is that necessary?
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   Define misinformation.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.480]   The Health Message Information Act of 2021.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:02.680]   Well, the bill actually tasks the head of Health and Human Services with defining what
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.320]   is misinformation.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.840]   How could that possibly go wrong?
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   I don't think so.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   Maybe a lot of ways.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.240]   Actually, you wrote a great, what did you, what did you, your headline of this was something
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.040]   like, I don't even remember something about murder and death.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.040]   It was good.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   It was, I liked it.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   It was good.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.040]   Let's, all right.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.440]   Let's, let's, let's, let's, do you want, let's go to our happy place.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   Let's go to our happy place.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   Talk about the Pixel 6.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   Let's take a little break.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:33.200]   We'll take a little break, a little, a moose-boosh, a little palette refresher to take the, the
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.360]   poor taste of section 230 out of our mouth.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.200]   And then we will, then we will talk about the Pixel 6.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:46.520]   Our show today brought to you quite literally by our CDN, our, our content delivery network,
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.840]   cash fly.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.800]   Cash fly has been innovating content delivery since 1999.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.200]   I know it first.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.640]   We, we've, we've been using them for the podcast for almost the whole time when we first started
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.640]   to it.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.240]   So many people downloaded it that the website crashed.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   Okay.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.240]   We need a better way.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   Let's see.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.320]   Then we went to BitTorrent and I was, I was reduced to begging every show.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.840]   Please seed our show so that others can hear it.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.200]   That didn't work out so well.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.760]   Then Matt Levine from Cash Flights, one of the founders called me and said, Leo, we can
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   help him.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   Man, have they helped?
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   It's great.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.560]   If you, and it's one of those things that you probably don't notice, but whenever you're
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.640]   downloading one of our shows, audio or video, and it comes in, lickety split and there's
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.640]   no delays.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.320]   There's no pauses.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.880]   You could thank cash fly.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:35.960]   Cash fly has 50 over 50 points of presence all over the world, which means it's the fastest
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.240]   CDN for global throughput.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.160]   You can get our content from a server that's near you.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:47.400]   And now cash fly is introduced ultra low latency streaming using the same network.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.080]   It's not the web RTC solution that has let us all down in the past.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:57.600]   Same delays on ultra low latency streaming with cash fly less than one second, one second
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.080]   latency that almost seems impossible.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.600]   It's practically infinitely scalable.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:08.840]   They can deliver video to more than a million users concurrently plus in just thousands of
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.600]   synchronous streams.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.720]   This is a mind boggling technology.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.640]   Their platforms designed for transmuxing thousands of streams simultaneously with live
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.520]   failover RTMP.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:29.280]   RTMP S gets ingested and turned into low latency, ultra low latency SLDP and HLS streams simultaneously.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.520]   They offer a great HTML5 player you can use with an SDK that means it can work anywhere
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:41.880]   you want your player to run websites, applications, mobile devices, whatever platform you're on.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:47.520]   On their low latency network, global network, your video streams will stream.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.880]   It's perfectly anywhere you have viewers no matter what continent they're on.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.680]   It's really a remarkable solution.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:59.080]   And the thing, one of the things I love about cash flies, their great support, their engineers
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.440]   are there 24, 7, 365 to help you with any issues.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:09.880]   And they will design a custom solution based on your unique needs, all built on their reliable,
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.120]   robust global network.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.560]   It's so good.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.960]   They can offer a hundred percent SLA.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:21.480]   I'm not going to 4, 9, 5, 9, 10, 9, 10, 9, 10, 9, 100 percent SLA.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:26.120]   A million concurrent streams, five times faster than other CDNs.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   They're nice people too.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.640]   They've donated now considerable amount of money through World Central Kitchen.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.800]   Nice job.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:37.920]   They pioneered the first Anycast CDN infrastructure way back in 2002, 2002.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.000]   Their best hop technology does it.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.840]   It automatically finds the fastest route to and from customer origin anywhere in those
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.160]   50 pops.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.760]   Look, just for you, right now, you can find out how much cash fly can save you.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.800]   You can see what their custom solution would do for you.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.880]   You may be overpaying 20 percent or more for your content delivery network.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.120]   And if you're not using a CDN, stop the insanity.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.200]   Go to twit.cashfly.com right now.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.520]   twit.cashfly.com.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.280]   Say goodbye to outages at 3 a.m.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.880]   That was my line.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.880]   Twit.com.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.360]   Because I don't want that 3 a.m. phone call.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.400]   The podcast, the servers are down.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.000]   Never happens with cash fly.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.840]   Twit.cashfly.com.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.400]   Thank you, cash fly.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.760]   Now an interesting story.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:34.040]   We talked about this on Mac break weekly yesterday actually because Apple is famous for saying
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.720]   nothing.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.600]   You could speculate all you want.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.920]   Everybody knows there's going to be a new iPhone in September.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   Everybody knows that.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.520]   We can guess what will be new on that.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.000]   There's even leaks.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.560]   But they are lips are sealed.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.760]   And in fact, they go after.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.040]   Oh, hell, L arrest people.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.440]   They go after L arrest people.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:57.240]   I went after somebody in China who was sharing the prototypes and said not only not only
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.840]   their Chinese lawyers say stop, knock it off.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.520]   They said, and by the way, we want to know everybody who gave we want to know who gave
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.800]   you those so we can go after them too.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.400]   Should they not?
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.640]   Should they not what?
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.600]   Go after those leakers.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   I think when you do it in China, it's a little bit different.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:19.240]   It's a little bit of a threat.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:24.400]   You know, well, they also they went after a journalist at gawker back in the day who just
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:30.360]   picked up a phone somebody left behind and they have their own police force cops.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.400]   But actually this is the question.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.880]   Should they not because Google in the face of kind of endless leaks about whatever Google
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.160]   does has decided to do the opposite.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.440]   And I think this actually might be a successful strategy.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:49.920]   Rick Osterlo they started with tweets and then Rick Osterlo invited a handful of tame
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.760]   journalists in to look at the Pixel six.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.880]   He wouldn't let him take pictures of it.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.040]   Wouldn't let him video it.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:02.680]   But look at it and to give them a pitch which was, you know, if you look at what they learned,
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.480]   it was essentially an ad for what the Pixel six would be without any real details.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.800]   For instance, one of the things Osterlo is all excited about is the fact that Google
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:17.440]   is going to design its own system on a chip for this.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:23.280]   When unmentioned is well, what exactly is they're calling it tensor because it will have probably
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.680]   elements of the TPU that Google offers right now.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.720]   But that's only a part of the chip, the A.R.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:34.080]   Part and it's widely speculated they were talking about this yesterday on All About Android
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.920]   that actually it's Samsung making this system on a chip.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:45.200]   But you know, the Pixel six, Pixel six pro available sometime this fall.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.160]   I think this might be a good strategy.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.800]   It for one thing they showed pictures of it.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.160]   So that short circuits all the little leaks and stuff.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.960]   Some many of which are wrong gives you an idea.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.160]   We know the phone's coming.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.160]   Really they didn't say anything.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.160]   We didn't already know.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.600]   We've seen pictures of it.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.920]   The camera bar in the back and stuff.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.600]   And it really gets a lot of attention.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.640]   It's a way to get good publicity.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.480]   I can't wait.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   I know.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.480]   You know what?
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   It worked.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   I will buy it.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.120]   The conclusion on Mac, weekly, we yesterday was the reason Apple doesn't do this is they're
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:20.640]   selling actively selling the iPhone 12 right now.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.920]   They're not going to talk about the iPhone 13 at all.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.920]   Ah, good point.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.360]   They don't want to end Google.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360]   Sure.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.880]   Maybe this will kill sales of the Pixel 5.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.880]   I have to laugh because what sort of three people that we're going to buy the last Pixel
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.880]   were going to kill.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.840]   So they have nothing to lose I guess by this strategy.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.400]   But I think there's a lot to be gained by this.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.080]   I think there are a lot of people like Jeff and me who will say, oh good.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.080]   Shmucks.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:51.800]   Maybe I won't buy the Samsung whatever Galaxy Fold 3 which I guess is going to be announced
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.000]   next week.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Maybe I won't buy that.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.440]   Maybe I'll wait for the Pixel 6.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.600]   So there's nothing but benefit for Google.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.240]   I'm waiting for the CX9 right now and I'm waiting for the Pixel 6 and this is killing
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.240]   me.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.800]   Both my machines are ready to die.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   What's the CX9?
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.800]   Is that your next?
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   That's the Acre Chromebook.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.200]   That's the beautiful Chromebook we talked about.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.520]   But it's out of stock.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.760]   Is that why you're waiting for it?
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.880]   Like it was what I don't mean to change the subject for this what I do here.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:23.120]   I went up and within minutes it was I will notify you.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   I want to be shorted.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   Can I be pre-ordered?
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.000]   It's going to be that way for everything.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Chip shortage.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.320]   Even Cook and the Apple analysts call this week or last week said we're going to be hit
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   by chip shortages.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:40.000]   Not for the main chips, the flagship chips like the M1 and the A16.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.440]   We're going to be hit with what he called them legacy nodes.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:49.480]   The processors that every phone hasn't made by little companies in China and the accelerometers
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.400]   and all these little chips, GPS chips, things like that.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.840]   We use that everybody else uses.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.440]   We're going to be hit hard.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.960]   I'm sure this will happen with the computer.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.040]   So you're buying the six.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.280]   Why are you buying the six?
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.920]   I'm just curious.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.600]   So I skipped the five because they didn't change much.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   Right?
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.880]   It was the same camera system.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.720]   This for the first time they're changing it.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.880]   There's a new camera system.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.880]   They didn't give out much information about it.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:27.120]   They showed the folks in the room pictures and videos, but they weren't allowed to share
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.120]   those.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.080]   Three cameras telephoto lens with 4X optical zoom.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:37.640]   Not as big as Samsung's, but still a reason to get it.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:46.240]   I actually bought a Samsung S21 Ultra because there was a deal on Google Fi about a month
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.840]   ago thinking, all right, this Pixel 5 has fallen apart.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.360]   I'm sorry, Pixel 4 is falling apart.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.240]   I should, although I didn't fix it, but I was thinking, maybe it's time to get a Samsung.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.400]   And then they said, oh, there's a delay.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.960]   And so I canceled it because really I don't want that.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.760]   I like pixels.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.760]   Right.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:12.360]   Plus I think the notion of the 4X, the 4X zoom, I'm not too keen on that.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   You'd like more.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.120]   What is the Samsung S21 is like?
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.680]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:23.360]   I still think with these sensors being as small as they are, it just doesn't work to have
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.800]   such a large zoom.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.400]   You really should just zoom with your feet.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.000]   Samsung's claiming 100X zoom.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.720]   And the pictures I've seen actually look pretty good.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:39.720]   The last one, I don't think it was the 21, but there was one Mr. Howl had and he allowed
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:44.000]   me to play with it at the studio and we went outside and did a little zoom testing and
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.080]   quite frankly, I thought it looked terrible.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.320]   Well, compared to your fancy Narn 5, of course.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.320]   It is.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.680]   It just looks terrible, even.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.160]   Look, look at this video.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.960]   This is a really good job.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.280]   This is from Hassan Vora, the Fono guy.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.280]   Look, he's going to do.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:10.760]   Let me let he's going to 1X, 2X, 3X, 5X, 6X, 8X, 1220.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.960]   This is on a Samsung Ultra.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:12.960]   That's 21.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.960]   That's 21.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:14.960]   Yeah, you see it's soft.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.960]   You see it's soft.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.680]   But get the picture.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.880]   I don't want that picture.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:26.520]   That's just for looking at something, but I don't want that to be printed out or shared
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.520]   or anything like that.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.760]   That's just for me to zoom in and look at something that I can't see far off with my
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.760]   own eyes.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   That's my opinion.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:40.320]   For example, I went out just the night to go check out the deer here in the field because
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.680]   I know they're always out there.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.480]   And I don't have binoculars.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:47.400]   I'd rather just pick up the camera and just zoom in and look, even though I know the picture
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:51.000]   is going to be horrible, I'm still just looking through from my own edification just
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.160]   for the view of those deer off in the distance.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.600]   And I think that's what these smartphones and their zooms are all about because from
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.840]   a picture standpoint, it just don't look good.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.840]   You're a photographer.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.840]   You're a photographer from the Instagram.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   They just don't call your photographer.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.840]   You're a photographer.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.560]   You're a photographer.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.640]   You have higher standards.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.720]   I think a lot of people, especially with kids and others, for instance, I was visiting my
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.000]   dad on Monday just like you, Jeff.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.400]   My dad's not as old as 88.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   And show my screen.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.920]   Can you or are you stuck?
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.040]   There you go.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.600]   There's a hawk in that tree.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.520]   Good luck finding it.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.400]   So I manually zoomed.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.640]   This is with an iPhone, but I was able to.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:36.240]   I mean, yes, it gets soft, but for a lot of us being able to get that.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   I agree.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.160]   If you're, you know, look, it's no Scott born bird photo.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.160]   I had been.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.480]   Oh, no, but that's not what I wanted.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:47.480]   I just wanted some record of the fact that that hawk was there.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.080]   So I think your standards are a little different.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.960]   Yeah, probably so.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:59.160]   I want to talk about the tensor piece because I think that, I mean, is it really, you raised
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.160]   the question, Leo.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.160]   Is it really tensor or they just use the brand?
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.480]   You know, how much is it AI?
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.640]   But the more processing occurs on your phone, it's, you know, it's what happened.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.520]   You know, I mean, my book about the earlier newspapers, where you had dumb terminals and
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.640]   then more and more and more smart when I'm on the terminal than you had your own computer,
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.640]   right?
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.840]   And the phone has been not dumb at all, but it's getting smarter and smarter and smarter
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:26.520]   and smarter and the processing that can occur there for immediate action, like translation,
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:32.000]   for improving photos, for privacy and not setting things up to the cloud.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.600]   I think that's the frontier that Google's been talking about now for two or three IOs.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.600]   Maybe, just maybe we'll start to see actually come to fruition.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:49.720]   Rick Osterlo demonstrated for the attendant, attendant journalists, something that you can't
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   currently do.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:56.240]   You know, Google has, and by the way, it works really nicely on the Pixel 4, this auto transcribe.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.920]   So if there's audio on it, YouTube video, whatever, it gives you the trans, I love that
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.920]   feature.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.920]   I think it's a great feature.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.480]   Well, or you could do simultaneous translation with the Google Translate app, but you can't
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.640]   do both.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:13.880]   So he demonstrated now, thanks to the Tensor chip, we can do this on phone, simultaneous
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.400]   transcription and translation.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.040]   Very cool.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:26.640]   I think that's a really good example of having more powerful AI on a phone can do.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.640]   I don't know.
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.640]   Mike, what phone, what do you use?
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.800]   This is going to be embarrassing.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   Oh boy.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.840]   If you say Nokia 3310, it'll be very.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   Very cool.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:42.040]   No, I have a one plus five.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.040]   That's fine.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.040]   It's a great one.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.480]   Oh, they're a few years old.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.480]   But it's old.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:52.160]   I tend to buy phones and then use them until they're on their very, very last legs.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:57.360]   And then I get deep into what is the latest and greatest and try and find something that
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.440]   would last me another few years before I have to look again.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.760]   But yeah, I'm sort of always paying attention to it.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.000]   Yeah, I like the one plus five and it's actually.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   It's a great phone.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.040]   That was the last good one plus actually.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.720]   Real buy another one plus.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.720]   Why?
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.040]   I actually haven't been following it.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:22.480]   So they got merged back into their Chinese parent company, Oppo.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.480]   I see.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.440]   All the reviews of the latest one pluses are that they're not great.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.160]   But I think the one I loved, I agree with you.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.400]   I loved the original one pluses and I loved the one plus five.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.720]   But I think that might have been the last one that was really good.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:41.680]   But if you like this, I think the Pixel 6 would be actually a very good next phone for you.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.600]   Is this latest phone, $8,000 phone?
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:49.320]   And are you all willing to pay for it other than Mr. Leform?
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.040]   Hey, Mr. Moneybags over here.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.440]   What are you talking about?
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.560]   Well, you've already said you're going to buy it anyway.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.440]   So you're excluded from that part.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.880]   You already said you're going to buy it.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.040]   They didn't announce a price.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.760]   They actually had some funny verbiage.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.480]   I don't know if I can find it.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:08.400]   Where they said that there's going to be two, the Pixel 6 and the 6 Pro.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:15.480]   The 6 will be like high end phone price.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.920]   And I got to find the pricing.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.320]   The phrasing, you're going to have to parse it.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.240]   They did not give a price.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:27.040]   Because I was thinking they were mentioning it the way Apple did their last couple of
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.040]   phones.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.440]   They had the Pro one and they had the Pro Max.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.440]   What's the Max run?
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.440]   $12.99.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.040]   Do you think Google Dares go that high?
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.040]   No.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.360]   Well, so that's the thing.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.680]   You got to listen to what the words that they said were if I can find them.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.280]   And let's see.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.760]   The price of your questions.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.440]   I've skipped two versions.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.440]   I used to buy every damn phone with the 3A XL.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.600]   So I skipped the four and I skipped the five.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:01.880]   So I'm going to convince my wife that I'm being tenurious.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.880]   Yes.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.880]   Okay.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:08.400]   Pixel 6 belongs to the upper segment and can keep with the competing products.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.800]   But the Pixel 6 Pro, this is Rick Osterlo, will be expensive.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.480]   It was specially designed for users who want the latest technology.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.320]   That sounds to me like $8.99 and $10.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   No, I don't think no.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.120]   Even Google knows you can't sell a $12.99 phone.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.160]   So probably $1,100 would be the highest that they'd be wanting to go.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.160]   It'll be around $1,000.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.800]   It strikes me as just interesting to note that how much more expensive phones have gotten
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:37.040]   over the last few years as compared to like...
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.960]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:44.200]   Computers that always seem to get cheaper, but the phones get more expensive.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.480]   And they're not doing as much.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:50.840]   I mean, granted there is AI out there to help out with certain tasks.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:55.600]   But for the most part, it's still a phone with very limited capabilities from a productivity
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   standpoint.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:02.000]   And I mean, it's getting to the point where the phones are as much as the computers.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.360]   You can get...
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.360]   Oh yeah.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.200]   If you can find them, Jeff, you can get good phone
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.400]   For a lot less.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.520]   Is there a justification for the higher price?
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.920]   I mean, miniaturization is always...
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.160]   Miniaturization has always cost more, right?
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.000]   The smaller it is, the more expensive it is.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.520]   And I think that you're seeing screen technologies that are very expensive now, OLEDs with no bezels,
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.520]   things like that.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.560]   I don't know if it's justified.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.520]   That's an interesting question.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.520]   Are they just...
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:40.880]   Every time I ask that people look at me as a cheapskate, and I'm like, "No, I just think
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:46.680]   that some things just have a certain value, you know, and a thousand dollars for a smartphone
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:52.800]   still just doesn't quite hit it for me considering what it's going to do and how long it's going
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:58.200]   to actually last considering like your Pixel 4 XL is now bursting at the seams quite literally.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:04.360]   No, but yeah, but thanks to the right to repair and I fix it, I was able to put a new battery
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.720]   in it and it's good as new.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.160]   So that's good news.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.320]   Was the battery exploding?
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.320]   It wasn't.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.880]   Well, it was on its way to exploding.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:17.240]   I mean, you know, I was just putting up with it.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.600]   One morning I came in and the back was kind of coming off.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.040]   It has a goiter in your phone.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.480]   And I thought, "What's going on?
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.480]   Why is the back coming off?"
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.320]   Maybe the glue failed because it wasn't an obvious bulge.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:27.840]   But then I mentioned it on the air.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.640]   I think it's because the battery is bulging.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:34.200]   And everybody from Father Robert on down said, "Oh, no, don't charge that phone.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.600]   It could blow up."
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.600]   Exactly.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.640]   So I went to it.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:42.880]   I was going to buy, as I said, a Samsung S21, but then I thought, "You know what?
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.120]   39 bucks I fix it.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.920]   They send you the tools.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:51.680]   I should demonstrate my geek cred."
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.680]   And I did fix it.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.680]   It wasn't hard.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.680]   It was smart.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:59.560]   And I also want to say that I understand that security is also built into the pricing
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.560]   release.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.960]   It should be.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.680]   Some people say if you can buy it unless it's expensive smartphone, you're going to miss
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:11.160]   out on security updates because it's probably running an older version of the OS and so
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160]   on and so forth.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.160]   I get that.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.160]   But still at the same time, $1000.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:20.440]   Well, and I think the thing that confirms your argument is there are very, very good
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:25.080]   phones for $200 and $300 that are done to be compromised.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.080]   But then you have the security concerns.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.080]   No, I don't think...
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:33.600]   I mean, Motorola's G-Power, which is what I get from my daughter whenever she breaks
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   her phone.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.360]   It's $250.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.360]   It's...
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.160]   Motorola's given them updates.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.160]   It's a great phone.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.160]   It's pretty clean.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.160]   It's as clean as...
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.160]   Motorola used to be Google.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.000]   They used to be quite nice.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.160]   They still are.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:55.200]   They're just very similar to the old Motorola phones that we loved when they were Google.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.880]   They're still clean they made.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.240]   They don't have a lot of crap wear on them.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.080]   I think part of the answer is what I will now know is the Masnic Doctrine.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.080]   That's right.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   I like it.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080]   I like it.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080]   But you're going to...
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.560]   If you don't buy a phone very often, when you buy it, you want to buy something that...
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.360]   You don't want to buy something that you feel is supposed to be.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.880]   You want to buy something that's going to stick with.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.880]   That's smart.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.880]   That makes sense.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.880]   I don't want to buy a phone for a phone.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880]   I don't want to buy a phone.

[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.880]   Well played.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.880]   Well played.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:16.480]   Facebook disables accounts tied to NYU's research into political ads saying, "Well, they used
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.880]   unauthorized means to collect data."
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.480]   Maybe that was what they did wrong.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.680]   Maybe they've...
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.680]   The NYU ad observatory.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.880]   The NYU Facebook users, but who were those users?
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.880]   Who were they?
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.880]   Advertisers.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.880]   So is that advertiser a user?
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.880]   Is it public?
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:41.880]   I think that 90% of what I see says Facebook not good.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.880]   10% says, "Well, there's a few issues here."
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.880]   I'm curious to hear Mike on this one.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.880]   But wasn't there a plug-in that the audience was using?
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:51.880]   It was voluntary.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.880]   The volunteers who put it up, but there was also going to other people's pages.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.880]   Stuff the volunteers site had at Facebook.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.880]   I'm on this side.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.080]   I agree with the complaints.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.760]   I think the complaints are right here.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.760]   But there is some...
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.520]   One of the warrior people like Defi Keller, she's saying, "Ah, there's a few issues here."
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.520]   All right.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.520]   But let me defend it.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.520]   There's a few little issues.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.520]   All right.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.880]   Let me defend what the overarching benefit of this is the NYU ad observatory.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.880]   Absolutely.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:20.960]   And what they were trying...
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:27.560]   The purpose of this was to kind of understand how political ads propagated what dark money
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560]   groups were spending.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.560]   And necessary research, entirely, incredibly important, necessary research.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560]   I agree.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   All right.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.080]   And Facebook should just give them the data.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.000]   I mean, the problem is that Facebook refuses to give them the data.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.200]   The answer is Facebook give them the data and stop messing around.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   Yep.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   Exactly right.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.200]   Exactly right.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.200]   There...
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.200]   That's it.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   All right.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   Next story.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.200]   As usual, Mike does it.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.200]   Boy, that was easy.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.240]   You know, Mike, we like to go on for a couple of hours, Mike.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:03.280]   Yeah, just don't know how hard your podcast is.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:08.800]   The browser extension, which again was used voluntarily by volunteers on their Facebook
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:16.000]   account, copied ads that people saw on Facebook, stored that data in a public database.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.040]   It did collect usernames, links to user profiles, and information about why users see a particular
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.560]   ad.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.960]   And that information can't be...
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.520]   Isn't publicly available, you have to have an account on Facebook, and that's why they
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.000]   had to give this plug-in.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.200]   And you could see examples where that kind of thing could be used for nefarious purposes.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.160]   And that is the 10% that Jeff was referring to.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.960]   But did you see Mozilla's response to this?
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.960]   No.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.960]   Because it was the...
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   No, on the rundown.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.800]   Go find it and pull it out 24.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.800]   I will.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.800]   I have it.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.800]   Line 24.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   Here we are.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.360]   Facebook's claims about the ad observer are wrong.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.120]   Go ahead, anybody can anybody can talk?
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:10.360]   So basically, Mozilla is saying that they checked out the code of the extension, and
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.120]   it is not privacy invasive.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.120]   Oh, interesting.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.000]   And so they're sort of reinforcing the NYU folks.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.080]   And the reason they have a dog in this hunt is because it's an extension that runs on
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.200]   their browser on fire phones.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:29.000]   So they, as they always do before they recommend an extension, analyzed its behavior.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.600]   But they did recommend it.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   Right.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:38.800]   And so it is sort of an odd situation because you can see an argument where you can picture
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.480]   a hypothetical scenario where there would be a similar kind of extension that also had
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:50.200]   nefarious purposes such as a Cambridge Analytica style extension that was sucking updated to
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.160]   then be used to manipulate you with this information.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:08:00.000]   And you could see where a company like Facebook that has been fined billions of dollars for
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.160]   allowing Cambridge Analytica to do what it did might have to put in place rules that say,
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.440]   like, hey, we won't allow this.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:13.600]   But in this case, this is clearly not that kind of situation.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:20.160]   And as I said at the beginning, and cut short, this discussion like Facebook, six, give
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.160]   them the data.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.760]   Give them the features of the data.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   Easy to fix.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:30.360]   And Mozilla does say, you know, we like to be proactive about third parties collecting
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.840]   data.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:38.040]   And we made an exception in this case because it was good faith security research.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:43.280]   And so we feel like the benefits to society outweighed the potential risks.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.400]   They also said it doesn't collect personal posts information about your friends.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.040]   It does not compile a user profile and server.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.760]   So a lot of the things that you might say, well, I don't want it to do that.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.760]   It doesn't do.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.760]   Right.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.600]   And what we should have is a general, which should go even beyond this.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:02.360]   And I've said this long since, you know, in this case, it's for researchers to be able
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.840]   to look at the advertising, which is vital.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.480]   But there should just be a general policy of out as I'm all advertising in my mind, but
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:13.320]   let's start with political advertising, where what it's targeted to, well, I've said this
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:18.680]   before, problem with saying what it's targeted to is that then you can find out if that ad
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.240]   came on my page, you might find out something about me as a result.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.120]   So there are privacy issues there.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.960]   But but the ads who places the ad and the targeting of those ads in general purposes
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.200]   tied to at least to the ad should be transparent as a matter of policy.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.120]   And it should be not just Facebook, every media company.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.160]   Facebook should do the same thing.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.880]   Forget getting NYU involved.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   Facebook should just publish it.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880]   Right?
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.360]   I know they were going to work.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.320]   Didn't they say they have the I had this.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.320]   Some.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.320]   Some.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.320]   I was going to say they publish some data.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:56.360]   But what the NYU people have said is it's not it's not all of the data that they have.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.280]   And it's not the data that is most useful for them as researchers to explore.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.840]   So sorry, Jeff, go ahead with.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840]   No, no, no.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.240]   The other point is that we were trying to say they should also publicly transparent about
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.520]   this to the to the user at about the ad.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.960]   And so I had this discussion at a meeting of a lot of rabid, the rabid, a lot of highly
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:21.800]   critical Facebook observers.
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:27.920]   And there was a now former Facebook person there who they trusted and we just said, yeah,
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:41.520]   but the problem is that if an ad is targeted to old men with white hair, then you can start
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:48.000]   you can set everything exactly, but you can then see that because the ad was targeted
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.840]   at me, you now know something about what Facebook says about me because of the targeting
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.160]   behind the scenes.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.000]   And that makes that public.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.120]   So there are issues of privacy around this, but they are solvable.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.560]   And Mike's absolutely right.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:08.160]   We need Facebook could end all of this by creating a policy of transparency about political
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.120]   advertising and making that as transparent as possible while also productive privacy.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.600]   It's possible to do it.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.600]   They're not.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:20.280]   And they're Mike Masik, a masterclass and how to take a two line story and enjoy a
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.680]   dual power discussion.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   I'm learning.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.680]   Yeah, we're here.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.680]   This is our real skill actually.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.240]   All right.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   It's behind the panel.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.640]   You see, it's 45 minutes of Leo manages to piss me off.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.120]   Oh, just wait, Jeff.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.720]   Just wait, I'm being nice.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720]   You were gone for a little.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.720]   Getting started.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.880]   Well, time to ease in, ease in.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:52.380]   Actually I was going to read this story on the Boston Globe about this Natick custom
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.280]   couple harassed by eBay.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.800]   This is on, but it's behind a paywall.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.600]   When I clicked close, it gave me a blank story, but then I refreshed and I was able to get
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600]   it.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.600]   So I don't know.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600]   Maybe they need to work on that.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600]   Earlier.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.720]   So what happened to this couple?
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:15.120]   It starts, they're doing like a lot of people selling some leftover stuff on eBay.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.480]   And then they start writing a newsletter or a blog or something saying, "Oh, this
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.080]   thing's we learned about how to do it better."
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.080]   And they offered advice.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.680]   They became their business to advise people about how to sell on eBay.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.680]   That's nice.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:33.400]   But occasionally, like Mike Masnick to any given technology company, they might have
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.400]   some criticism.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.400]   Wow.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:42.360]   eBay literally sick the dogs on them, sick their security head on them doing all kinds
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:48.720]   of terrible things, painting graffiti onto their fence at their home, sending pizzas
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.320]   to be delivered to their house.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.600]   But the least of it, a dark van following them all around.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.000]   You know what this reminds me of is Scientology.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.560]   I have a friend, a longtime friend who was a Scientologist, she left.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.720]   And the things Scientology would do to you if you left were very similar.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.720]   Harassment.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.720]   Yep.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.080]   Where did eBay get the idea?
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.600]   This was a good idea.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.080]   Well, one of the people started with the leadership.
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.120]   I still can't figure out what the end game here was, right?
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.120]   I know.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.840]   I took tremendous interest in this story as a small independent publication that often
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.760]   criticizes large technology companies.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.160]   But what is the end game?
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.880]   What do they think is going to happen?
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:40.520]   If they intimidate this couple over and over again, send dead pigs to their house, follow
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:45.920]   them around town in dark vans, show up in the middle of the night, graffiti their house,
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.280]   that that's going to suddenly make them decide to walk away.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.280]   That's the only way.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.760]   Cross between a troll and a mafia boss.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.760]   Similar behavior there.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.520]   So it was a night thought about like what happens if YouTube were to do this?
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.400]   Because if you go to YouTube and decide, okay, I want to start a YouTube channel and I want
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.040]   to make this thing big and great and so many views and likes and so on, you're going to
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.000]   look up resources to try to get all of those goals.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.360]   And you'll see a gazillion different YouTube creators giving you their best tips and sometimes
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.360]   it's quite critical.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.960]   Well, the mistake these couple made is they pivoted from simple tips to talking about
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.720]   the company and the company and the way it was run and so forth.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:39.120]   Going to the, I guess they're suing or maybe there's a criminal prosecution.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.200]   Well, yeah, one guy's in jail.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.120]   It was a sentence for a year and a half.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.120]   Prostitution.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.560]   Did you hear his excuse though?
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.560]   No.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:52.400]   He said it was the, he blamed the alcoholic culture at eBay.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.360]   Oh, that's all right then.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.280]   You know, the weird, the way it began was a little weird.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:04.040]   They spray painted graffiti on their new fence, but instead of writing something really insulting,
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:09.440]   they spray painted a fighter, Fido master.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:14.760]   And the couple said, we, we, we, we googled it to see if some kids are saying these days,
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.680]   what does that even mean?
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.920]   So maybe the guy was drunk.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.920]   It was a user.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.920]   Like it was a user name.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:25.160]   Again, they said it was, it was a troll on their site.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.880]   And so they were sort of, I guess, trying to imply that it was the troll that like, you
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.440]   know, people in their, oh, it's me, Fido master painting my name on your fence.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:39.120]   Prosecutors said the harassment campaign starting with the fence spray painting incident was
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:45.480]   directed by James Bow be a UGA, chu headed eBay's global security and resiliency unit.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.920]   Gee, wouldn't you like that guy?
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:52.320]   When I start a global security and resiliency unit, you'll know that we're in trouble.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.880]   That's a sign.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:59.760]   Resiliency, along with other participants in the scheme, Bow was charged last year with
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:05.000]   conspiracy to commit cyber stalking and conspiracy to commit witness tampering.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   He's awaiting trial.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.760]   So cyber stock, wait, conspiracy to commit cyber stalking.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.760]   That's a statute.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.760]   Yes.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.760]   Oh, wow.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   I didn't know that.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.760]   Good thing.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   Right.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.760]   And witness tampering.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:23.840]   Gosh, this is, this is, it's an amazing story.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.760]   But it's, I think you have a link.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:35.600]   They thought it was all like kind of goofy, you know, Roger Stone grade harassment, right?
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.360]   Not like the life's the ban following you around.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.960]   Yeah, but not life threatening.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.800]   They called it taxidermy.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.920]   No, an animal parts shop in Arizona.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:53.120]   They called to ask about an order for a, of a fetal pig.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.680]   You know, it's just, it's like, it's like, it wasn't like they hit him over the head with
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.320]   a hammer.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:05.240]   They delivered a sympathy wreath for one of the members of the couple.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.520]   The driver said he had come from central square and Cambridge was instructed to leave
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:14.440]   the $255 wreath by the back door without ringing a bell.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.760]   You know, that's, it's harassment, but it's not, you know what I'm saying?
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.920]   It's, but I mean, for the, for the couple, it's still terrifying, right?
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.280]   I mean, they said they started sleeping apart.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.280]   You know, they set up next.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:31.280]   I mean, it was just, they were, they were constantly stressed out and, and terrified.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.200]   And you can see why I, I mean, I think it's pretty bad.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:42.000]   Two people from the security resiliency team flew to Boston, rented two vehicles, checked
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.800]   into the Ritz Carlton hotel, initially planned to plan a tracking device in the Steiner's
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.520]   car, but it was locked in the garage.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.080]   So they went back to the hotel.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.080]   So they keep the cops.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.080]   They really is.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.480]   The next day they came back Steiner, the one of the, the man was up on a cup, a ladder
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.760]   installing security cameras while his wife handed him tools out of a second floor window.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:09.880]   Suddenly she saw a dark colored Dodge caravan driving up their streets.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:13.600]   Black van, New York plates, she told David is the van drove past.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.600]   We felt in danger.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.360]   We felt like targets, it took another pass by the house.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.760]   And then later in the day, the same van pulled out to follow him while he was in a car with
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   his friend.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.800]   It's, it is, you know, this is going to be a great movie because.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.840]   Well, the thing is too, there's, there's others.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:37.120]   I can't talk about it, but in previous regimes, eBay did other bad stuff.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:42.560]   And so there's, there's an interesting cultural thing here to use the high-folute word.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.560]   Okay.
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:48.320]   And, and then so the CEO, CEO, then I, I've met a couple of times.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.600]   He was a, he was a number two executive warriors.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.760]   This is not a technology store story.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.440]   This is a crappy company story.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.720]   But there seemed to be a lot of them.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.720]   Look at this fire.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.840]   Look at this blizzard story, the, the world of what craft team and the harassment and
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.480]   the weird stuff that's going on.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.080]   How do companies get this toxic culture?
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.920]   How does that even happen?
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.640]   Power man power, wealth and power.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.640]   I say it's not just technology.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.800]   This plus big fear about that.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.800]   It's lots of companies can do this.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:23.240]   What we need is a powerful government that can crack down on kids playing games late
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.240]   at night.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.240]   That's what we need.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:34.240]   Ten cent under some pressure, I think from the Chinese ruling party has cut kids playing
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.720]   time on their flagship game, honor of kings.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:42.800]   If you're under the age of 18 in China, you're playing time will be limited to one hour on
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.360]   regular days, two hours on public holidays.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:52.000]   Jesus, mom and dad.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   Previously.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.280]   I read this and I could see my mom's just, just applauding.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.280]   Yes.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.240]   It's many times and she fussed at me about playing.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.240]   I got married to this to me.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.480]   It's a half an hour of television every night.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.400]   That's all you're allowed.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.920]   And was the choice between Batman and the man from uncle.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.280]   I just, three hours of podcast, no problem.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.480]   Why do you think I do such a long show now?
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:22.360]   There was a government directive issued in late 2019, which actually was the original
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:27.560]   cut back to an hour and a half on a regular day and three hours on holidays.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:32.240]   They also ban players under the age of 12 from spending money to top up in the game.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.960]   That's fine.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.960]   If you're between 12 and 16, you could spend up to 200 yuan a month.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:41.200]   That's about 31 bucks a month.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:47.000]   No charge could be more than 50 yuan while those between 16 and 18 years old are limited
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.320]   to 400 yuan a month.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.600]   I think this is fine.
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.280]   In fact, I think we should.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.040]   Why do you think this is fine?
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:59.360]   Well, first of all, it's not the government doing it.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.480]   It's the game company doing that.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.480]   I think this would be fine.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.920]   Is that really that different in this case?
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.920]   No, okay, maybe.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:16.360]   But if I, when I was playing Simpsons, tapped out, if they had said you cannot buy 200 donuts
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.280]   and I wouldn't have been the end of the world.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.800]   Has you invested that Amazon stock?
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800]   I know.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.440]   I'd be wealthy man right now.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.880]   If TikTok, instead of just having some guy say, you know, you're really been doing TikTok
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.160]   a long time, you should have a drink of water.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.720]   Simply said, enough is enough.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720]   Go to bed.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.400]   I don't think that would be a bad thing.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.760]   It's not the, again, if the, if the government's doing it, I, you know, I understand.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:48.920]   But if a company, even because of the, you know, stink eye from the CCP says, yeah, maybe
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.920]   we should do this.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.920]   I don't think that's so bad.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.920]   But as Mike said, it's not the company, the company and the government are the same
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.920]   thing in this case.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:55.920]   But you understand the crack down.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.920]   No, Tencent is not the Chinese government.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.680]   But Tencent is one of the companies like DD, like Ant Financial, that the Chinese government
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.880]   is paying a lot of attention to all of us.
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:13.560]   So that they may be just be sensing the change and the wind.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.640]   I, you know, it's very interesting.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.560]   I think that there are a number of people I quoted last week.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:26.520]   Didn't I know a Smith of Noah, the No Opinion blog, which is the best name for a blog ever,
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:33.120]   saying that it really is Chinese, the Chinese government's focusing their resources on
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:40.280]   hard tech, not consumer tech, not, not things that don't actually produce something of value.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:45.720]   And now for the Foreign Affairs magazine calls it China's Sputnik moment.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.080]   It's, it's, it's the Chinese government saying, yeah, you know what, we're going to crack
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.520]   down on consumer internet companies.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:58.200]   And by the way, on, on for profit online education firms, and the Foreign Affairs says in order
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:03.120]   to, in part to redirect the country's efforts towards other strategic technologies, such
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.120]   as computer chips.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.400]   Yeah, they say it's military, but while way, for instance, nobody's cracking down on
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:13.580]   Huawei, nobody's cracking down on the, in fact, they're putting a lot of money into internal
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.960]   chip design and things like that in country chip design.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.320]   So I, that makes sense.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.880]   I can understand why they might want to do that.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.240]   But then do they have time crystals?
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.240]   Sorry.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:32.800]   No, no, only we have time crystals that segue the greatest, according to next web.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.120]   And you know, I looked at them for scientific information.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:40.680]   The, the greatest scientific achievement of our lifetime.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.480]   I want you to explain this to me.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.160]   You smart folks.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.360]   Any takers on that?
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:51.840]   The only thing I know is that apparently it violates the laws of thermodynamics.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.840]   So I'm out.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:53.840]   Two of them.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:54.840]   I have no idea.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.840]   Two of them.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.840]   Not just one.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:02.440]   T&W says it's a big screw you to Sir Isaac Newton.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:09.840]   It's a perpetual motion machine, but it's at the very smallest molecular level.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:15.360]   And they use the Google says they use the quantum computing labs to do it.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.960]   If we create the world's first time crystal inside is a quantum computing.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.520]   So it changes state without using energy.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.520]   Exactly.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.520]   Right?
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520]   Is that the basic thing?
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.520]   So if you had an analogy T&W uses, if you had an ice cube that would melt and refreeze,
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.880]   you know, in a, in a cycle, but, but never have any energy come in or go out, that would
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.520]   be like a time crystal.
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.960]   All right.
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.960]   And that's sure.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:39.960]   And that violates.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:45.320]   That's that violates Newton's law of first law of motion.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.320]   And also.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.920]   And the wall of entropy, right?
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.840]   The law of the universe always moving towards entropy.
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:55.040]   It does feel like the beginning of a very bad science fiction movie.
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.040]   Well just the name.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.800]   It's the name, frankly, time crystal.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:07.480]   If they call it oscillating for fabric, interventionist time capsule, we'd all go, okay, fine, whatever.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.480]   I don't know.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.480]   I think paper call it.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.480]   I don't know.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.480]   I didn't even look at that.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:12.480]   Should have paper.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.480]   Good Lord.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:14.480]   There's an academic paper.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.480]   I think it is going to the source.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.880]   What an idea.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.320]   Let me see.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.080]   This is from our VIX observation of time.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.960]   Kristlyn Eigen state order on a quantum processor.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.880]   Look at all the names.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:38.640]   They had so many names on this article that they actually had to leave five of them out.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.680]   For those of you on audio, it's a very fat paragraph.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:44.680]   That's a plus one.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:45.680]   Yes.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:48.720]   All right, Jeff, you asked for it.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:53.360]   Did you know quantum many body systems display rich phase structure in their low temperature
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.280]   equilibrium states?
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.880]   However, much of nature's not in thermal equilibrium were remarkably.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.440]   Remarkably, it was recently predicted that out of equilibrium systems can exhibit novel
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:11.240]   dynamical phases that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermal dynamics.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:17.960]   A paradigmatic example being the discrete time crystal we shall call DTC.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.880]   Does that help?
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   Does that help?
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:26.280]   No, Dr. Phil was on this show.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:31.720]   That's the Dr. Phil interpretation.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:40.440]   Concretely dynamical phases can be defined periodically to have been made up of...
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.120]   How about eigenstates?
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:47.680]   I got to get next web really did go over the top.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.880]   I kind of enjoyed it.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:49.880]   This is the most important thing.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.000]   I don't even know what it means.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.920]   I don't know what it means, but they...
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.440]   But it's got to be the greatest scientific achievement of our lifetimes.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.760]   I don't think that's actually true.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:03.040]   I think you could point to some other pretty important achievements.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.440]   It's interesting to me because it's another quantum computing step.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.240]   Google likes to announce these.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.040]   By the way, they were the second team to do this.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.960]   The other ones did not use a quantum computer.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.360]   They did it some other way.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.160]   But it's a state of matter.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.320]   That sounds like a big deal.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:26.200]   The other team did it in a diamond.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.200]   What?
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.200]   In a diamond?
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.200]   So is it the time diamond?
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.640]   It was a time sandwich.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.480]   Wouldn't you rather have it in a diamond than in a quantum computer?
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.360]   I'm still skeptical over this whole quantum computer thing.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:44.360]   It's not.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.680]   Anyway, good on you, Google.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:52.320]   If there weren't so much government money pouring into this, I'd be a little less skeptical.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.560]   I feel like it's just, "Well, let's build this lab.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.960]   We can get some money for it.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.680]   It'll be a great job."
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.240]   I love this New York Times article.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:08.040]   Two influencers who were very upset that they and some of their friends have been taken advantage
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:13.240]   of by online brands, just not paying them enough money for especially women.
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:21.640]   Especially women for their plugs have created a website called FUPayme.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:31.640]   Basically the F-Y-P-M.V-I-P basically the idea is like a glass door for influencers.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.880]   You find out what other influencers are getting paid for, their brand campaigns, and that
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.840]   gives you the power to negotiate for a better deal for yourself.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:47.040]   I saw this and I really enjoyed the idea of this.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.200]   The other side of me said, "Well, maybe you need to hire a better manager as well because
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.040]   I know of a couple of female influencers such as Elise Swopes.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:04.360]   She's doing quite well for herself, being an influencer on Instagram and Twitter and so
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.040]   on and so forth.
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:12.240]   So well to where she's even gone to Belize with the Smith family, Jada Pinkett Smith and
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:16.040]   Will Smith and all of them because of her work.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.240]   She's able to negotiate.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:23.640]   She was able to get a good management team to help her with this stuff.
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.560]   I just hate the whole influencer thing just drives me.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.000]   Now we'll go ahead and say on her behalf, she hates it too.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.840]   But at the same time, she understands her value.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:43.360]   She understands the art that she can create to help with brands and market and whatnot.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:48.960]   So hey, she's a gun for hire, if you will, and she does a damn good job with it.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.680]   I think there's something really interesting about just the information sharing aspect
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.680]   of it.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.080]   The issue here was that they felt like they were being taken advantage of because there's
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:01.640]   an information asymmetry that they don't know what's going on.
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.000]   So the information sharing part I think is really cool.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.920]   The thing that made me a little bit, feel a little weird about this is even like the
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:14.280]   term that becomes the name of that website.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:20.480]   Where that comes from and where that's been used in the past is in cases where people
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:27.920]   have done stuff willingly as a volunteer for free and then gotten mad afterwards over
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:31.840]   the fact that they volunteered to do stuff.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:35.880]   And there's this sort of belief around that particular statement that nobody should ever
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.920]   do anything for free.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.640]   And as someone who's now doing my entire career for today.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:44.640]   Congratulations.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:50.960]   We need an FQ pay me for bloggers.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.840]   No, that's a perfect phrase, information asymmetry.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.720]   And there's a lot of sites like this.
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.200]   That's what Glassdoor is all about.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:03.240]   Find out what others in your field are getting paid so that you can negotiate more fairly.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:09.160]   And by the way, plenty of employers are adamant to not share how much you make with other
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:14.600]   staff members because they know that's just a recipe for disaster.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:19.080]   Because if people knew they might say, "Hey, Ant's getting $50 an hour.
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:21.400]   Why am I getting 10?"
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.960]   And by the way, people tell me that all the time.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.200]   The other thing here is that you tell them, bless you.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.840]   There's different reasons less your heart.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.160]   Ant's a lot cuter than you are.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.600]   There's different reasons to do it too.
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.880]   When people would scream about, "Huffy to post steals people."
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:43.360]   I put myself up for free on "Huffy to post" because I got the audience there.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.680]   I got value out of it.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:46.080]   I chose your choice.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.080]   That's reasonable.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.720]   That's your choice.
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.480]   We had a sponsor for some time that was for graphic artists.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:00.400]   You would put up a job that you wanted to do and you'd ask graphic artists to provide
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.680]   samples kind of to bid for the job.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.080]   And a lot of people said, "No, no, no.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.120]   Don't ever do work for free."
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.120]   That's fine.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.560]   Don't, if you don't want to, same thing with photographers.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.000]   It comes up a lot with photographers.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.840]   You know, don't do a shoot for free.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.600]   But there are some people for whom that is a sensible economic choice.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.800]   Nobody's forcing you to do it for free.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.960]   Don't tell you and Lisa, but I do this show for free.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.960]   Please, I've had...
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.960]   Please, quick.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.960]   You'll see a lot of this.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.080]   No, I'm the only one doing this show for free.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.080]   Oh, I mean my...
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.080]   Yes, that's true.
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:35.280]   Me and my good, I want to do it in this show for free.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:40.600]   You know, there's a lot of folks in the creative community and some of them that are
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.600]   rated as "influencers."
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:48.120]   They will tell you that, yeah, there are times when you do some things for free.
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.520]   I know I have.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:55.080]   There were certain opportunities presented to me in the past and someone wanted to offer
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.280]   up the payment for it.
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:59.320]   And I said, "No, I want to do this pro bono or what have you."
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:05.240]   Because I felt like I'm going to get more out of that one gig in the long run.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.960]   That's going to pay me more than what it's being in.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:08.960]   And that's your choice.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:09.960]   Right now.
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:12.680]   Sometimes, yeah, you can choose to do some things for free.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.600]   You don't expect to do everything for free.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.440]   But every now and then it's okay to do some jobs.
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.880]   The point is it's your choice.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.640]   But I agree with Mike.
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:22.720]   Information is key.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.920]   So you need to make an informed choice.
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:28.360]   And if people are normally getting $1,000 for what you're about to do for free, that might
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:32.920]   be helpful to know that and might change your point of view about doing it for free.
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:34.360]   There's also matters of equity too.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:39.960]   When I started out in the business, "Oh, here goes Jarvis."
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:40.960]   I first internship.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:42.440]   I don't have to say anything anymore.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.840]   Jeff just does it for himself.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.200]   I chill myself.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:49.440]   At Chicago today, the people that had to know tomorrow, I was paid $75 a week.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.240]   Well, I could afford to do that.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.240]   Right.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.880]   I was still in college.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.960]   And now I understand that free internships are not a good thing because of the inequity.
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.320]   But I'm also with Mike that it's not necessarily the case that you shouldn't do stuff pro bono.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.320]   You don't have to get paid for everything.
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:12.360]   I mean, it depends on the situation and what it is that you're getting.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:16.480]   There are situations where doing something for free will get you a large audience.
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.680]   And oftentimes that trade-off is worth it.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:23.760]   The question is, how much do you know about the trade-off and what do other people get,
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.560]   but also what is the actual value that you're getting back?
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:29.000]   And the problem is when you don't have that information.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.640]   So a site like this, I think, that is giving you the information in terms of what other
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:36.480]   people getting paid and how valuable is it to do certain things.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.880]   I think that's really interesting.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:41.680]   If they find out like, oh, I did this and I didn't get as much money, but it led to
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:45.160]   all these other deals like, hey, that's really valuable information.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.160]   Yep.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.120]   And so I like the information aspect of it as long as people are going into it willingly.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:54.560]   And I'd hate to live in a world where everybody says, oh, I'm not going to open the door for
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.560]   you, lady.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.560]   You got to give me a buck first.
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.160]   You know, I mean, I know.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.920]   There's a certain amount of stuff you just do for the karma points, and that's fine.
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:06.320]   But when I wrote the book that got me on this show, what will Google do was Seth Goden sent
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.400]   me down and said, listen, Spock, write a book, but don't write the book to write the book,
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.160]   write the book to get the gigs.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.880]   I wrote the book and the rest is history.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.400]   Leo stuck with me for 20 years.
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:16.400]   Everybody knows.
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:19.640]   So the last thing you should do is write the book to make money.
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.280]   That is not correct.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.680]   You write the book to get another book deal.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:29.800]   You write the book so you can get on the BBC and be a commentator.
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:30.800]   That's why you write the book.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.160]   Oh, good speeches.
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.440]   Good news.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:40.240]   You will be getting a check for $2.50 some days.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.720]   This is Mike Elgin should get a least four dollars.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:44.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:48.080]   Google Plus, there was a class action lawsuit.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.240]   Maybe you didn't remember this, but after Google basically shut down Google Plus in
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:56.800]   2018, which was like a year or two later, it came out.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.360]   Wall Street Journal reported because we've written Murdoch, you know, that Google Plus
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.160]   had exposed the private data of hundreds of thousands of users for years, that Google
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:10.840]   knew about the problem and that the company opted not to disclose the data leak because
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:16.520]   if they were worried about regulatory scrutiny, Google did acknowledge the data leak.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:23.440]   They admitted that the private data of half a million accounts actually wasn't private
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.640]   and since nobody's using Google Plus, we're just going to shut the whole thing down.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:33.880]   That's when the class action lawsuits started the class action lawsuit, Matt Madick and Zach
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:39.480]   Harris versus Google filed October 2018.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:48.560]   The case is that Google plus data litigation.com settled in June 2020.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.360]   Google agreed to pay out seven and a half million dollars.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.840]   I want you to lawyers, man.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:59.080]   Half of that money went to legal and administrative fees and about 1.7 million people.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.920]   Now remember, there are only 500,000 accounts compromised.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:07.960]   But anyway, 1.7 million people filled out the forms by the October deadline and those
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:15.160]   people do a little math, 3.25 million divided by 1.720 million.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.240]   You get $2.15.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.240]   Congratulations.
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.240]   You're a winner.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:24.680]   I'll put that with my $3.00 AMD check that I got the other day.
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:25.680]   I got it.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.520]   Yeah, I get I don't even cash these checks.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.280]   There's too much trouble to cash them.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:36.600]   I got a bag of pop chips in the mail for the big pop chip loss some years ago.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:42.200]   At least they sent me something I could use.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.840]   It was an API thing.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:51.640]   Developers were able to access data from Google's people API even from profiles marked private.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:57.040]   If you were smart enough to be able to use the API, you could scrape Google basically.
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:02.440]   Then there was another plug, a bug again with a people API that was for many more people.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:05.800]   The case was expanded to cover those two and a half million.
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:08.400]   That's why they were so many winners.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.200]   There are so many winners today.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.840]   I suppose I should give you Jeff a couple of stories.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:23.640]   Top German court says Facebook must inform users about deleting their posts or suspending
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.040]   their account.
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.960]   Explain why and allow them to respond.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:28.960]   See, it's fair.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.240]   The one hand they say, get rid of all this joke on Facebook.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.480]   Get rid of it all.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:38.120]   Be nice to those people who are big old junk.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:39.400]   You can't win it, it's Germany.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.200]   This is a Mike story.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.320]   I'm not talking to a German accent.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.080]   Get rid of them but do it with a smile.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:51.040]   It's a glen story that was not written by me.
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.680]   It's kind of crazy because you can understand the thinking behind it.
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.520]   You're saying, oh, yeah, you're shutting somebody's account down.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.640]   You should tell them why.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:03.160]   Then you begin to think about most of the people whose accounts are being shut down.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:07.120]   Do you really want to have to explain to every spammer why it is that you're shutting down
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:10.520]   their account or every troll or every harasser?
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.080]   Why is that you're not going to do their account?
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.080]   They got that trick.
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.040]   Now we're going to have to go trick.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.520]   That's a good point.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:24.160]   So much of it is really teaching the trolls how to walk right up to the line without crossing
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.520]   it because you have to explain to them each and every time.
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:34.200]   It's tricky because if you're on the receiving end of that and you legitimately don't think
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:38.480]   that you deserved it, then it totally makes sense that you want that explanation and you
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.920]   want that clear explanation.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:45.760]   I've had accounts shut down for various reasons and we're like, come on, explain it to us.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:50.960]   That's what we had with Google and their AdWords stuff.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:54.600]   But at the same time, you recognize there are a lot of bad actors.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:40:00.040]   If you have to explain every little detail to the bad actors, that only helps them or
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:03.520]   their companions be really, really bad actors.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.320]   So it just becomes really, really tricky very quickly.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:09.120]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.560]   We have a Mastodon instance that's a federated Twitter.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:17.400]   Don't show this screen, John, because I don't want to give out any personal information.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:22.920]   Because we were getting spam so much, I made it necessary to apply.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.520]   Every day I go in there.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.160]   And there's always, in fact, there is right now because one of the things we say is why
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.720]   do you want to join this?
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.400]   And there's one guy says, listen to Twitter, I'm interested in Mastodon, I want to see what
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:34.560]   the community is talking about.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:35.920]   Yeah, I'll prove that.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.200]   And then the other guy says media.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.560]   You see these and I know on our forums.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.880]   On the Twitter community.
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.200]   They say, sometimes it's very interesting.
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:49.280]   Spammers are very honest.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:54.640]   They say, well, I would like to share news about my litigation practice with everybody
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:55.640]   in here.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.520]   I mean, it's interesting to see the variety.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:01.480]   And then half of them say, I love Twitter.
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.960]   And those people have absolutely rejected, absolutely rejected.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.920]   So let me just to prove you Greg.
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:12.320]   All of the cases, I mean, my questions is, my DMs are open.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.320]   And generally that's fine.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.720]   I get to people talk to me.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.240]   I wouldn't know if I was to talk to.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:22.880]   But then there's always those accounts that say hi from Gina 647, 177, 6, right?
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:24.920]   Twitter, were they going to go to the effort to kill?
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.120]   Oh, well, you're killed because you're Gina 164.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.120]   Well, no, they could do that, right?
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:32.240]   I mean, how hard is that for them to do that?
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.560]   There's nobody to contact.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:34.560]   It's BS.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.560]   It's Germany.
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.960]   When there is, we find another way to make life different.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:45.240]   When we ban people or when we don't approve people on the Twitter forums, there is a field
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:47.120]   that says why.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:50.520]   But it's very generic, like your spammer or your schmuck.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.520]   Yeah, right.
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.520]   Your schmuck is a good one.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.160]   I have to add that to the field.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:59.160]   You don't have to give them, in other words, too much information about what it means.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:02.760]   And then meanwhile, Google is suing the German government.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.800]   Yeah, I don't understand this.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:05.960]   We're going to explain this.
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:06.960]   I don't understand.
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:14.760]   The Netsdege, Netsdege, hate speech law, which requires Google to dime users to the government.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:15.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:23.000]   The problem with all this is that bad speech would hit a couple tests on the platforms.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.720]   And the first test is community standards.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.560]   The next test is legal.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:31.120]   So if something just didn't pass community standards, you're gone, well done.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.320]   The government's complaining, whoa, whoa, whoa, that person did something illegal.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.600]   We want to put them in jail.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:41.240]   You must tell us, even though you're not a lawyer, you're not a court, you're not an
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.240]   agent of the police.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:45.880]   Nonetheless, you will do, you think Germany of all people would get this idea.
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:46.880]   Other people do it.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:49.000]   The police work for them is not a good idea.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.080]   You must do our police work for us and report those people to us.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.440]   You don't shtasi, but that's what they want.
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.080]   And so Google is now, plus their heart, suing the German government saying, yeah, we don't
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.080]   want to do that.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.880]   We don't want to be a police force.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.240]   And yet I can see why it might be easy, you know, it's bad PR for Google to say no,
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:12.720]   because all the German government is asking for is, look, somebody posted hate speech.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.680]   We want to know who that person is.
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:23.600]   But then we turn around and then you know there's going to be a fjure about tech, let's
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.960]   say it's not Germany, let's say it's China.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.840]   When Yahoo did that in China and a man went to jail, everybody had a proper and good fit
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:31.840]   about it.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.240]   Very good point.
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:36.000]   It's let the government do it and they can put a subpoena in.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.840]   They can do lots of things.
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:41.280]   But this is not the role of a private company to play police.
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.280]   But that's what they're expected them to do.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:48.040]   Yeah, I mean, if the government spots something that they think violated the law, let them
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:53.120]   go through the proper legal process, get a subpoena, get, you know, and be able to go
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.080]   to the company, present the evidence, let the company look it over and decide whether
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:02.720]   or not they think it's a lawful subpoena and pass on the information in that way, not this
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:07.560]   sudden just, you know, you have to hand it over kind of thing.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:12.200]   If you've been worried with Larry and Sergey out of work, you know, you're wondering how
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.200]   they're doing.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.200]   Are they okay?
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.040]   Yeah, how are they okay?
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:20.000]   Are they keeping and making ends meet?
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.480]   You might be glad to know they've sold more than a billion dollars worth of stocks since
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.480]   May.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:31.160]   Sergey sold $610 million Larry Page, $462 million.
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.960]   This is under a pre-filed trading plan.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:39.600]   You know, you can't have to tell the SEC when you're going to sell these shares.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.320]   And they actually hadn't sold shares for four years.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.400]   So now they'll be able to have dinner and, you know, maybe go see them.
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:50.400]   Yes, I was going to say, are they, are they interested in supporting an independent club
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:54.240]   and a fun, weekly podcast?
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.680]   Would cost much, right?
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.040]   You actually have it on your site.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.080]   I think you are for sale.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.040]   One hundred million and one.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.120]   And one, don't forget the one.
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:05.720]   It's the one all about there.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:08.440]   Oh, because it was a hundred million dollars at first.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:11.000]   And then we wanted to know if the prices will go up.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.760]   I mean, if you don't buy now.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:13.760]   It's a lie.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:14.760]   You can buy today.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:15.760]   I'll get in.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.760]   It's going to cost you more tomorrow.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.600]   Inflation is pretty crazy these days.
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.160]   Actually, the way you put it is great.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:28.760]   So you can buy, you know, be a friend of tech dirt buck or 15 bucks or five bucks.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:33.080]   You know, there's lots of, you can buy lunch with Mike, which people have done for 500
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:36.440]   bucks if you're in the Bay Area, come over, have lunch or even spend the whole day with
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:37.760]   tech dirt.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:38.760]   That's the fun stuff.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.840]   Then there's an anti tech dirt section for one million dollars.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:45.000]   You can have a date without tech dirt.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.680]   You just, tech dirt goes down for a day for a hundred and million and one dollars.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:51.680]   You can just come.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:52.680]   That's it.
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.560]   We'll just shut up and go away for one year.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.120]   It's only one year.
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:57.120]   Yes.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.120]   Yes.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:02.560]   Oh, there is a multi year discount, right?
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.560]   Yes.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.560]   It's, it's negotiable.
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:05.840]   We'll, we'll talk about it.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:11.480]   I will be happy to shut up for, I don't know, 10 million.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.480]   I'll shut up.
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.240]   Wait, are you competing with me?
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:19.680]   Well, I think there are more people that want you to shut up than we need.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.080]   Oh, yeah, I'm coming.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:22.880]   Oh, yeah, we're going to.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.120]   Absolutely.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:28.080]   Why shut up, Mike Mazmik, when you can shut me for a hundredth of the cost.
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:32.120]   There we go.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.520]   I don't think we have to worry either one of us.
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:35.520]   No, no.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.520]   No.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:45.520]   Remember the story in the British broadcasting about Amazon destroying a unsold stock at
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:51.680]   one of its UK warehouses, including smart TVs, laptops, drones and haired dryers?
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.400]   Well, that story had a good effect.
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:01.280]   They have announced, Amazon has announced that following the backlash over those products
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.280]   being destroyed.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:05.720]   And they, you know, they're actually, I understand why as a business Amazon want to destroy them.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:11.320]   These are products stocked by Amazon for third parties that never sold.
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.280]   Third parties just, you know, bailed.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.280]   Did want them back.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.280]   Didn't want them.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:17.560]   What's Amazon supposed to do?
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:23.200]   But well, now they have created a couple of programs to do something with those instead
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.360]   of just destroy them.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:30.120]   Program one, FBA, great and resell will allow third party businesses on Amazon to resell
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.480]   return items is used.
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.000]   That's one thing that will help.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.880]   And then there's going to be an FBA, which is fulfillment by Amazon, by the way, I should
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:46.040]   explain that fulfillment by Amazon liquidations program where you can get, I guess, I don't
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:48.680]   know, somehow get money out of these bargains.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.440]   Yeah, bargains, bargains.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:51.920]   Cheap deals.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:55.640]   The other thing Amazon did, I was interested this week finally because I got a fair number
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:04.040]   of books from Amazon and they shipped the first book in a fully paper, thus recyclable
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.040]   nice.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.520]   I've been getting those too.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:10.160]   I think a lot of my Amazon stuff's been coming in those recyclable pouches.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.160]   I like that.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:12.160]   About it last.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.320]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.720]   YouTube has banned Sky News for a week.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:18.720]   Australia.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:22.320]   Sky News Australia for a week over COVID misinformation.
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.320]   Wow.
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:25.520]   Do you think this is owned by Murdoch?
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:28.680]   Sky News UK is not anymore.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:34.240]   Sky News Australia is fully owned by Murdoch and it's like Fox News on steroids.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.280]   Yeah, they actually deny that COVID exists, which will come as a surprise to the 4.5
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:42.560]   million people worldwide who have died from this non-existent disease.
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:46.360]   Oh, maybe they just were old and died anyway.
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.600]   That's probably what it is.
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:48.600]   Sure.
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.600]   Well, I wonder why did Rupert get a shot then?
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.160]   Why does Tucker?
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.760]   Why does Tucker bother?
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:59.280]   They also deleted a bunch of the videos.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:03.200]   I mean, they suspended the account for a week, but they permanently deleted.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:04.960]   They wouldn't say exactly how many.
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:09.080]   I think the Guardian tracked down at least six videos that had been deleted.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:12.360]   And that has always been Google's policy to do that.
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:13.360]   They should.
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.440]   That's fair, whether they're a big boy or not.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:24.240]   YouTube is also creating a $100 million shorts fund for people who were wearing shorts.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:31.160]   No, for to challenge short videos.
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:32.160]   Short videos.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.160]   TikTok stock.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:34.160]   No.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:37.000]   To people who are smaller than five foot tall.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.360]   No, this is for shorts.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:42.040]   YouTube shorts are those 30, I think they're 30 seconds.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:44.640]   Actually, now the TikTok is now three minutes.
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:46.880]   Are they previously known as fleets?
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.880]   No, that's Twitter.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.920]   No, that was Twitter.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:56.040]   The fund that will reward creators for their most engaging and most viewed short form videos
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:03.160]   between 2021 and 2022, obviously trying to drive traffic to their shorts platform.
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:07.520]   Payouts may range from $100 to $10,000 based on viewership and engagement.
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:08.920]   This is TikTok's done the same thing.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:13.520]   This is what matters not if all of the influencers are in on this stuff.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.520]   Their engagement is going to be through the roof.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:17.520]   Absolutely.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.520]   Absolutely.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.560]   I almost think these companies really don't need to pay people.
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.360]   The reason YouTube is is because the shorts thing is a new program.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:29.520]   In fact, I remember Renee Richie saying, "Yeah, I'm trying some shorts so that I can
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:32.200]   get in this shorts thing."
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:35.120]   Get it in the shorts from YouTube.
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:36.520]   That's the story.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.520]   Right there.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:43.680]   Actually, getting back to Amazon, they've got a little conundrum.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:49.120]   Well, companies like Google and Apple are saying, "First of all, we're not going to reopen
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:50.120]   right away now.
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:54.600]   Thanks to Delta and these hotspots, we're going to slow down the reopening."
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:59.120]   And when you come into the office, you'll have to be vaccinated.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:00.120]   Facebook's not doing that.
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:01.880]   They're saying you have to wear a mask.
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:08.280]   Amazon says, "We can't because there are so many vaccine deniers in our warehouse.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:15.320]   So many COVID skeptics, they're afraid if they require employees to get vaccines or even
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:18.360]   to mask, it wouldn't go over."
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.520]   Well, $16 an hour instead of $15.
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:22.960]   They'd lose a lot of employees if they do that.
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:28.920]   So I heard the same rationale from the old folks home where my father lives.
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:30.360]   Well, why don't you require?
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.840]   Well, we'd be short staffed.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:35.520]   What that means is that it has to be leadership from on high.
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.920]   It has to be governors and presidents.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:40.360]   There also should be a company like Amazon that says, "We'll pay what it needs to get
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.360]   the staff.
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.360]   We're going to have a safe workplace."
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:47.960]   Yeah, because I mean, if the workers die, they're going to have assured it's anyways.
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:51.200]   And worse to go, there also insurance is going to cost is going to go up.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:52.200]   People who are sick.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:56.680]   What I don't understand in all of this is why I have not seen commercials from an insurance
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:00.040]   company saying, "Would you obviously order the day of Schmuck?
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:03.240]   Would you Schmuck's get vaccinated?
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:06.880]   Would you Schmuck's give Amazon your palm print?"
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:07.880]   Sure.
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:08.880]   Would you do it for $10?
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:09.880]   I do it for free.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:10.880]   I'm a Schmuck.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:11.880]   Don't.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:12.880]   Okay.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:18.000]   I think it's widely agreed by security experts that your fingerprint, your palm print, any
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.920]   biometrics are problematic because you can't easily change them.
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:26.160]   I guess you could burn your hands with acid.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:31.560]   But this is unlike giving out any other identification.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.280]   This is hard to change.
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:37.520]   I gave my eyeball to watch the player to get on their planes.
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:38.520]   Clear.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:45.000]   So Amazon uses these scanners for something to call Amazon One.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.160]   It's in their Go stores.
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:52.600]   You could pay for goods by waving your hand over a scanner.
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:56.680]   Amazon grocery, Amazon book, and four-star stores are all over Seattle have them.
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:01.520]   They're going to New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Texas.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:06.840]   Could there have been another way for them to do this for those Amazon One stores?
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:10.240]   Apple does this with a fingerprint.
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:16.800]   You could, instead of storing the palm print, you could store a hash or some one-way data
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:21.720]   trip that you could then match up with a palm print without actually storing it in the cloud.
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:24.600]   I don't know if Amazon is doing that though.
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.880]   There are ways to preserve privacy and still collect this data.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:35.360]   And I mean, and I'm with Mr. Jarvis on this, the people that fly with Clear, you definitely
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.040]   walk up to that retinal scan.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:38.840]   Yeah, they got mine.
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:39.840]   They got mine.
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:43.560]   This is the first time I flew and a year and a half, by the way, I don't want to fly
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:44.560]   again.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:45.560]   It's not fun, is it?
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.560]   No, going to Florida and...
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:50.560]   Well, I'm going to Florida again.
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:52.880]   I'm staying out of Florida completely.
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:53.880]   What?
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:55.520]   You're not pre-anymore?
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:58.280]   I had that same thing happen.
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:59.280]   What?
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:01.280]   I didn't know where I was.
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:03.480]   I didn't know where my Clear because I wasn't flying.
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:08.800]   Somewhere in the middle of the pandemic, apparently my TSA priest had expired.
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:12.040]   And I discovered that last month when I went to the airport for the first time.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:13.480]   Is it supposed to expire?
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.480]   And you...
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.480]   Ah, I guess?
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:19.920]   Apparently mine is part of global entry.
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:24.800]   So I spent 45 minutes on hold to get to TSA to say, "Oh, no, no, that's not a TSA number.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.960]   That's a global entry number," schmuck.
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:32.480]   So now I've got to spend five years on the phone and I go to global entry and I said,
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.480]   "Okay, well, I'll just do this online.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.480]   No, we don't know you exist."
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:35.480]   No.
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:38.800]   Five years ago, when I had to renew, I got to notice.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:42.200]   This time I got to notice and I'm sure I'm going to have to apply again and they're going
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:45.880]   to tell me, "Oh, no, no, that's going to take two years to apply."
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:46.880]   Fine.
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.840]   I went to New York a few weeks ago for the first full day.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.120]   I don't miss it.
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:53.280]   I don't miss the commute.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.440]   I don't miss the city.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.200]   I flew for the first time.
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.200]   It's the year before I flew for 2000 miles.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.200]   But you're a little bit more legendary.
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:00.840]   I don't miss it at all.
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:04.520]   I want to stay right here in this room.
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.920]   I don't want to go anywhere.
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:13.120]   So apparently your TSA pre does expire thanks to our chatroom, this page at TSA.gov.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:15.080]   Yeah, I thought it was annual.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:18.040]   Is it time to renew your TSA pre membership?
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.640]   Now, I know understand your global entry, so this really wasn't--
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:22.320]   Yes, I'm better than that.
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:24.640]   I'm bigger than that.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:28.200]   So you can check in and see if it's time.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:33.280]   I have applied for global entry, but in order to-- the final interview has to be conducted
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:35.360]   as you fly back into the country.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:36.880]   No, you could go.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.880]   I know.
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:38.880]   There's a bunch of places.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:40.520]   I know, but there's nowhere near us.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:42.520]   I'd have to go to Sacramento.
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:43.520]   But--
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.520]   So I'm flying--
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.520]   I know.
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:50.960]   I just wined for a whole show.
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:51.960]   I'm flying.
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:52.960]   You have one little one.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:53.960]   I'm flying.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:56:01.320]   Maybe we're going to Mexico in October and I'm hoping that that tentative approval will last through then and I'll
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:03.560]   Lisa and I will try to get a global entry
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:11.960]   It's absolutely great. Yeah, if you travel internationally, it's great. Oh yeah, Priz great. You don't have to take off your shoes
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.220]   Right I
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:21.040]   Did take my shoes off on clear last flight unclear no and no my clear has inspired
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:24.200]   That is right. No one I was trying flying again
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.920]   But this last trip out to visit my mother. I didn't take my shoes off
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:36.640]   Hmm I definitely did last last month without after I had the same thing it was global entry also that had expired
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:42.480]   I guess I either I missed the notification or they didn't I want searching I didn't get a notification huh and
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:48.960]   Yeah, I had a take off my shoes and go through all of that like a savage
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:51.320]   Oh, yeah, so much depending on the animal
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:58.040]   Yeah, it's definitely different in different airports because flying back was a very different experience than fly the way
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:05.480]   I apologize for saying like a savage. I've been informed that that disparages savages and I will not say that anymore
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:07.480]   I will say like an animal is that okay?
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:15.440]   Apparently disparages and like it is a lie. There's no law coming out seriously that that treats animals as sentient beings
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:18.560]   Oh, no, so I can't even say a rock
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:20.760]   Like a rock
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:23.960]   You can't insult a rock
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:32.080]   Do you need Amazon echo in your smart soap dispenser Amazon thing so here's a
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:38.880]   $55 soap dispenser that needs Wi-Fi connection so that you can talk to it
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:46.040]   According to Amazon you can the reason they put it a speaker in the in there is so that you can automatically play songs jokes and more
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:48.320]   while you wash
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.120]   Actually one of the dumbest ideas I've heard you know
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:59.200]   You can and it's really dopey, but you can't ask your echo to play the song while you wash your hands
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:04.240]   So you wash your hands for 20 seconds remember in the old days during COVID we had to wash our hands remember that
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:07.640]   Mm-hmm. It's coming back, baby
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:17.320]   It's it is a variable rate dispenser that pumps out more soap the farther away from the nozzle you hold your hand that's pretty good
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:22.680]   It is a little pricey compared to other soap dispensers, but I did actually
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:30.400]   Turn our entire house it to an airport washroom by putting automatic soap dispensers everywhere
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:34.080]   And by the way, just like the airport they stop working after a while
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:39.840]   We I bought them every I bought them from here because I want why don't want to have to go
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:45.040]   On something that's got COVID on it. I just want to go put my hand under it
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:52.720]   Mm-hmm, and then wash my hands, but they don't they're not very reliable. I've had them all die on me over time
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:56.560]   So I'm not gonna buy one with an Amazon echo in it. That's for sure
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:01.200]   Seth Rogen is alive and well
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:04.840]   You'll be glad to know okay
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:08.200]   It's funny. This is funny. Was he laughing?
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:19.800]   Apparently there was a tick-tock that questioned his well-being since most of his posts these days are about
[01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:27.040]   Pottery the tick-tock is in their story is it I'm trying to find it. Oh, yeah, it's worth watching
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.840]   Oh, it's as POT. Yeah
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:37.880]   Missing
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:39.880]   Lately
[01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:48.760]   Photos of his face is haven't seen a recent photo of his face. Yeah, I have a pretty crazy hypothesis
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:52.160]   This is good night by a shady ceramicist who has him died
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:56.160]   Compensitated those time pics on sets Twitter, so we think he's wow
[01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:03.160]   Impossible that in addition to comedies of can make pottery. I'm just saying can we check on Seth?
[02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:06.280]   Can we check on
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:11.440]   This is why I love tick-tock. This is the greatest. This is why I love tick-tock
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:18.080]   Of course this viral Chris can be funny
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:21.200]   He said re-enact his favorite lines from pineapple express
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:46.200]   Chris can be funny give him some credit on the yeah, this is good, so this must have gone viral so
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:51.720]   You think that first sounded eerily specific and you think I must be planning something equally malicious, but that is
[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:55.480]   The dogs looking away
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:11.080]   This is a time and effort
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:17.560]   He doesn't have convince a friend to be the survivors is this the best medium the best place you could do this
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:23.920]   I think so you wouldn't do this on YouTube right now. Yeah, no, this is the place this should exist Twitter
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:25.920]   No, although he did tweet it
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:30.040]   But actually was Seth Rogen that tweeted this video is very funny and not at all true
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:35.000]   I have not been kidnapped. This is not a kidnapper writing this from Seth's account. I promise
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.080]   Thereby starting the whole cycle over again
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:46.480]   We need a picture of you Seth with a recent newspaper or a recent vase
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:51.560]   Apparently is it actually a potter and you know what?
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:58.080]   They're pretty good. Look at those. I wouldn't have have figured you as a boss guy Mike Bazdick because I'm a vase guy
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:01.960]   I would have thought you'd be a vase guy, but you're a boss guy. Yeah
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:08.480]   It's aunt but but vase has been sort of beaten into me at some point
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:15.880]   I think I was probably original of a guy and then it changed over time by whom who would beat you into being a vase guy
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:20.680]   That's an evil
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:23.080]   Ceramisist if yeah
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:26.960]   Yeah, I mean I may know one or two ceramicists
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:31.120]   Got a potter in your life
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:35.440]   So there's a little a little late breaking media news here that Axios has oh
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000]   Puck boy, which is a new brand?
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.760]   Puck has announced some of their talent
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:45.760]   Including Dylan Byers who senior work media correspondent NBC News. They hired him on
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:54.540]   Baratunde. Oh, you know I saw Baratunde sent me a text saying some big announcement is coming
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:56.760]   Yeah, so I just sort of the bottom of the other
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:03.000]   Puck has raised seven million dollars from 40 North media. We don't know much about it
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:08.880]   But they're getting some real but the name Puck implies its humor and hiring Baratunde might also
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:11.560]   indicate that
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:19.520]   Interesting it's puck dot news it launched today and will officially launch the website in September
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.640]   Dylan Byers a year exclusive interviews podcast, etc
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:33.160]   75 from from Politico is Washington, corresponding so this is some heavy-duty news people it is it is
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:41.000]   I'd be sure Benjamin Landy former executive editor is a fast company digital will be executive editor. I think Julia I offer is just great
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:46.980]   Oh, I'm glad they hired her. Yeah, she's wonderful. Oh, that's good. I'm snapchat
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:49.000]   Huh?
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.240]   Company maybe was founded by Joe
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:53.080]   Porsicki
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:55.080]   Who founded Luminary?
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:57.080]   Which is a podcast company?
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:03.880]   Didn't they sell to Amazon? He probably has a ton of money John Kelly New York Times editor and founder of the hive on very fair and
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:07.320]   early athletic employee Max Jayon
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:09.880]   long-time digital media executive
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:15.680]   The company brought on a nice as co-founder and COO
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:21.080]   Wow. Oh, so Mike wait a minute. What what what?
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:26.820]   It's they're gonna paid memberships get ready. Yes two tears
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:30.680]   Enough man. You're not charging enough by regular membership
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:33.400]   Access to all of the articles

[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:04.440]   But it but out of the gate without sight unseen. It's a lot
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:10.720]   Amazon studios they will have sponsors A&E network S3 partners and Warner Media a lot of big media
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:14.000]   advertisers
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.440]   Focused on the inside story of the nexus of Hollywood Wall Street Washington and Silicon Valley
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:21.640]   That's but that's a pretty big nexus
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:27.880]   That's it. I think it leaves out commercial real estate. I think it's all yeah
[02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:32.320]   How are money and ego so it's gonna have an attitude
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:35.680]   It's a lot of money though
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:38.520]   What they coming back to life as well
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:42.280]   Gosh has been relaunched as well. Yeah, I
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:49.440]   Do like Julia Yafi. I would I would get it for her and a baritone day. I'm thrilled to hear baritone days working
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:54.520]   And Dylan Martin Dylan viruses very good. Is he? Yeah, he does media so it's good
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:06:00.400]   I guess I'm gonna have to do this and replace him now because I used to be I kind of sorta am I a media guy?
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:01.600]   I think I am
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:03.840]   So you are kind of have to do this
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:07.240]   All right a tech guy puck
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:15.440]   Dot news, so sorry for that late breaking news brother you find that interesting fascinating. No, that's good stuff
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:25.100]   Here a tundanus. He's such a good cat. Yeah, yeah, buses, but man. He's always busy. I love him
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:27.100]   It's good to see him gainfully employed
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:33.320]   Axio says there should be a push for the PBS of the internet
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:36.240]   Jeff Jarvis says what?
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:41.760]   What what do they even mean PBS of the internet? What do they even mean?
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.600]   It's it's kind of a Newton Minnow
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:49.200]   Reflex from the 60s of we should have the Internet is kind of a messy place like TV is a was a great wasteland
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:53.960]   So let's create a channel in a world of scarce media that made sense right?
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:56.940]   Right, it didn't exist and there was no big bird
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:07:01.840]   We were placing a home for big bird in a world doing you want on the internet exactly?
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:04.120]   It doesn't make a lot of if you want to be yes in the Internet
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:09.480]   Just go do it and imagine government involvement. No, no, no, no
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:14.120]   No, there's plenty we don't need government. It's goody two shoes thinking
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:18.600]   President Biden scared the hell out of me
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:22.520]   This is a tech dirt story once again
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:29.000]   He look you see I subs I subscribe to your RSS feed
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:41.920]   You're the one really are there a few people? No, no, we actually have a lot of people who read the RSS feed
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:49.520]   And you know what I like about your RSS feed you do full articles. You don't do those we do two sentence pieces there
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:55.040]   Absolutely, so I'm gonna read this from my news reader go for it Joe Biden
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:58.200]   Speaking
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:00.200]   Where was he speaking somewhere?
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:06.560]   He's he said something he said out loud the thing everybody's thinking
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:12.480]   Which is these cyber attacks could lead to a shooting war?
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:15.000]   Yeah, Biden
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:22.120]   Said on Tuesday cyber threats including ransomware attacks are increasingly able to cause damage and disruption in the real world
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:24.120]   This is a speech at the office for the DNI
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:31.800]   So he's speaking to the intelligence agencies if we end up in a war a real shooting war with a major power
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:35.720]   It's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:42.600]   So those of us who have been saying well cyber warfare at least nobody dies or you know
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:48.720]   It's not quite as bloody perhaps as a shooting war. Maybe not maybe it could
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:52.400]   He did not mention Russia
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:54.480]   but
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:59.560]   He did well immediately then mentioned that Russia was spreading misinformation
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:05.720]   Ahead of the 2022 midterms is a pure violation of our sovereignty mr. Putin
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:12.320]   He said he said his name has a real problem. He's sitting on top of economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:20.400]   Nothing else nothing else. He knows he's in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous boy. I think that's all very accurate
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:23.600]   Yes agreed to sure
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:26.400]   It's I mean, it's it's accurate
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:29.160]   But the question is was that was that a wise thing to say?
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:37.040]   You know there there are these concerns obviously lots of concerns about cyber attacks and and you know other kinds of computer mischief
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:43.360]   But you know saying directly that you may respond to cyber attacks with actual
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:45.640]   You know weaponry attacks
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:51.880]   Seems like an escalation and not necessarily an escalation that that we should be making right now
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:55.080]   I agree, but he has been escalating the rhetoric all along has any
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:10:00.520]   You know really calling Putin out saying you got to do something about ransomware and you know
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:02.520]   We talked about this yesterday in security now
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:10.560]   but the ransomware gang that brought down colonial pipeline which then disappeared we think perhaps because
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:14.480]   either of the US or Russian military or
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:18.880]   Police agencies going after them seems to have re-emerged
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:23.720]   And their code is identical to their original code
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:28.800]   And and maybe this is one of the things that precipitated
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:31.280]   But did anyone think that they weren't going to reappear?
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:36.960]   I mean, yeah, they disappeared but there the people behind it were still out there and they still want to make money
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:40.240]   I think the idea was always that they were just going to reappear with a different name
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:46.800]   And so I don't think it's that surprising what they did the dark side ransomware gang has re-emerged as black matter
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:49.320]   And it's ransomware by subscription
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:56.560]   It's very similar the code is almost said it is identical in fact to the dark side a code
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:04.800]   Ransomware by some scrup she know, yeah, that's the way it works these days you have affiliates
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:08.720]   So as if you're this oh I see it's ransomware are
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:12.080]   AAS right right yeah
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:17.200]   So you're smart enough to create the ransomware the best way to make money is not to inflict it on people
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:22.400]   But to make it available to script kitties and others who want to you know make a little money on the side
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:26.200]   I was thinking of the new business model for the Wall Street Journal. It is a business model
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:29.560]   For everybody I'm thinking about it
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:34.720]   So if you don't subscribe I'm gonna kill the internet
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:41.600]   Remember that great lamp national lamp hood cover we should do it with the dog yeah, yeah, yeah, under the head of a server
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:46.320]   Buy this newspaper or we'll kill the Internet. Let's do a quick change login
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:51.080]   We can wrap things up because we were going a little long here play the drums if you will my stroke
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:57.600]   Watch how fast I can do this
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:04.680]   Next is how fast this show has gone I know well it's fun when we get a great consider and Mr
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:07.680]   Honors get a great guest
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:12.760]   If you're still running Android 2.3.7
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:15.320]   You get a grandpa why?
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:24.360]   Well bad news starting September 27th devices running Android 2.3 percent point seven and lower will no longer be able to log into Google services
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:31.720]   Yeah, I think it's a bad time is that gingerbread. It's a pretty old version of Android like even older or doughnut
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:39.080]   Gee yeah time to get rid of it. It is a very small number of people, but you know
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:46.500]   They're out there and that's a big problem for a Google so get ready because say goodbye to your gingerbread
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:53.560]   Chrome OS 92 is rolled out redesign emoji and emoji picker e sim support
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:59.280]   pre-installed meet PWA progressive web apps
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:07.240]   Google meet PWA means you can use Google meet as a progressive web app which means weirdly
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:14.840]   You could you could put in your menu or your title bar put an icon on your desktop in it even though it still has to basically have a browser
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.720]   It's like a standalone app chat will also be
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:23.560]   PWA and both will be pre-installed as a launcher icon on Chrome OS
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:28.120]   e sim is for cellular phones obviously
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:33.440]   There's some other stuff, you know if you're a Chrome
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:36.440]   User you're just gonna get it
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:41.440]   Auto magically you don't have you know, it just happens Google Chrome
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:46.440]   Will also change how it shows insecure websites they won't
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:52.520]   It'll it'll only well
[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:54.720]   It won't show you whether the site is secure anymore
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:14:01.040]   It'll only show you if it's insecure because Google's pushing hard for HTTPS everywhere and basically
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:06.760]   This is their way of saying it is everywhere and in the few cases where it's not we're gonna put a little black
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:09.640]   Mark a little black
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.120]   lock
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:17.560]   It's gonna be confusing to people because until now the lockman it was secure. Yeah, that's that's a little
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:21.600]   So now it's gone and if you see the lock it means it's insecure
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:23.960]   Oh
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:25.960]   I'm confused
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:29.080]   Well wait a minute no, it's not HTT
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:42.000]   Chrome will not only will only display security indicators when the site is not secure as shown below so the
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.280]   Read the problem I had with that is I always click on the lock to see
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:52.780]   The certificate, you know you click on the lock and you get this information and you can then look at the certificate and so forth
[02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:56.700]   I guess I don't have to have another way to do that
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:15:01.260]   No figure it out at some point and let us know so security
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:06.220]   Oh, what yet moving along
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:16.580]   Chrome some of these I'm seeing for the first time
[02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:21.780]   That's why it's a little slower Chrome for Android is becoming a two-factor security key for Google account
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:24.060]   sign in and
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:31.180]   Actually, I love this single sign-on thing where it says are you trying to sign in and you say yes and it does that
[02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:38.380]   Used to be you'd have to have an app the Google app on your phone now you can do it if you've got Chrome off on your Android device
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:41.180]   Which is fine because you probably do
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:48.380]   So you don't have to install anything additional just it'll just do it with Chrome. This is another new feature in a chrome for Android
[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:50.860]   YouTube's premium light subscription
[02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:57.900]   Is now going to give you the chance to have ad free viewing but for less it's being piloted in Europe
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:05.900]   That's why the price as you see it is six point nine nine euros a month. I think it'll be ten bucks a month in the
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:11.660]   US which is less than the premium plan. I'm not sure what the US price will be
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:16.060]   Six it's about 60% the price of a premium subscription
[02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:19.940]   But you only get about a quarter of the benefits says the verge
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:22.940]   This is an experiment only available
[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:27.140]   in the Nordics and Benalux except for Iceland
[02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:30.060]   Sorry Iceland
[02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:33.500]   Premium light as is
[02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:39.660]   We were talking about this last week right that the reason we have Google music or YouTube music is because we don't want to pay for
[02:16:39.660 --> 02:16:42.620]   We don't want to see ads on YouTube and it just comes along for the ride
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:48.660]   So maybe this will be this will be the YouTube music free version of Google premium
[02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:55.940]   And finally the August security patch. Oh, I should check is rolling out to Google Pixel the OTAs are live
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:58.620]   That's good. You always want to do that?
[02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:05.380]   Three security fixes and one functional update to address accidental assistant
[02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:07.220]   triggering
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:09.620]   No one wants that and that's
[02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:12.780]   The Google change
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:20.340]   I think I'm gonna cut short the theme there. Oh, we want we're out of here. This is
[02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:29.380]   If Mike Masnick can do a short podcast I can do a short how long is the tech dirt podcast?
[02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:33.220]   It's usually in the 45 minute range. Oh
[02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:37.540]   And how often
[02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:38.980]   Piker
[02:17:38.980 --> 02:17:41.700]   Weekly how do you 45 minutes a week?
[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:49.460]   How do you credible and crap current episode came out today the problem of jaw boning?
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:50.860]   What is jaw boning?
[02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:52.860]   So jaw boning is
[02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:57.300]   kind of what we talked about a little bit earlier about this idea of government officials
[02:17:57.300 --> 02:18:03.540]   Trying to convince websites to take down content and and where that line is between
[02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:06.740]   persuasion and
[02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:11.580]   Compulsion and you have an actual law professor. Yes, Genevieve Laquier
[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:15.060]   From the University of Chicago. Yep. Good
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:22.900]   Good good good anything you want to plug as we wrap this show up Mike Masnick besides that fabulous podcast and of course
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:25.500]   tech dirt calm and
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:33.420]   Support tech dirt with their insider shop and somebody should buy a silence tech dirt for a hundred million dollars besides that
[02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:36.900]   Now accepting bitcoins
[02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:43.340]   I mean, I mean just having people read what we write is always the most important thing to me
[02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:47.780]   We're working on a whole bunch of cool projects. So stay tuned for that
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:52.980]   I know I've plugged in the past on your show the CIA game, which is over my shoulder
[02:18:52.980 --> 02:18:59.620]   The card game that we have we are working on a new card game. Oh nice. Oh that so that probably will not be out till
[02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:03.140]   Late fall maybe early next you still buy CIA
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:09.980]   You can and in fact you can now buy it on Amazon, which is not only got it up on Amazon very recently nice
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:14.380]   Is it if I search for CIA probably won't find it maybe tech dirt
[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:21.740]   If you say CIA game it should come up as the top result good because I and when I search for CIA tech dirt
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:25.700]   I got a vertical low top low three card badge holder
[02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:28.260]   I'm not sure what that is
[02:19:28.260 --> 02:19:33.500]   Secrets by earpiece. So I'll switch for a CIA game instead
[02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:36.460]   Yes, there it is
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:43.500]   Collect it all is what it stands for a competitive card game 29 bucks on Amazon
[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:49.820]   Thank you, Mike's really we love having you on anytime you want to come on and talk for two and a half hours
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:51.260]   You're welcome
[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:54.020]   Yeah, but I'm gonna try and force you to be quicker. Oh, no
[02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:58.700]   Let me bottom line that Michael say and then the show be over
[02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:02.980]   Yeah, well, thanks for thanks for having me. It's always a pleasure
[02:20:02.980 --> 02:20:04.980]   Oh, it's always a pleasure
[02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:09.700]   And of course Stacy will be back next week number of the week mr. Jeff Jarvis
[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:13.740]   Well just to make us feel old and happy talk about the past was tribes Leo crazy
[02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:19.020]   It's been 40 years since I met MTV launched I
[02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:21.660]   Know August 1st, 1981
[02:20:21.660 --> 02:20:29.340]   Video killed the radio star, but as some wag joked it's been 40 years since MTV launched
[02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:32.580]   It's been 50 years 15 years since they played music
[02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:41.180]   They really are now a reality show channel. Yep too bad like everything bravo
[02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:43.180]   Everybody they've all done that
[02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:47.340]   Even you know towards the end of tech TV. We're running the show cops
[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:52.860]   It was like I guess that's all cable channels eventually become a reality show
[02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:55.100]   sad
[02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:57.100]   Yep, aunt

[02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:07.340]   Folks that are using iOS for content creation Luma fusion recently had a big update
[02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:12.300]   Oh, he's they love it. He's that last month, but now it's it's ready to go
[02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:18.420]   So you're creating videos and editing videos and you get to maximize the power of M1 and
[02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:26.580]   Do some some video stabilization right there inside the app on a on a iPad is pretty pretty
[02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:32.180]   That go impressive. It's a paid app. I think that is 30 bucks. I believe
[02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:37.220]   But you get all the updates after that. So yeah, it's worth a worth a look and
[02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:41.100]   Lastly make sure you go check out the wanderers photo
[02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:44.820]   Workshop that's the workshop. I'll be teaching that here in October

[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:14.060]   Twitter TV slash hop for mr. Pruitt and the fabulous hands-on photography
[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:21.140]   I've got two picks for you one from ways which is a Google product and I give credit to Paul Thorett for coming up with this one
[02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:24.980]   if you go to my ways you can now drive with
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:32.780]   Master Chief there's a halo tie in so there's a Master Chief voice or you could be this
[02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:38.900]   Scarum you can also do the your car could be a warthog or the ghost and
[02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:45.180]   You can have turn-by-turn directions from Master Chief and I'll give you an idea of how they sound
[02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:49.580]   Let's let's let's go home here. I'll have have I'll have
[02:22:49.580 --> 02:22:52.260]   Have this Nick navigate home
[02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:54.780]   Let's see if I got the sound on
[02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:57.780]   Turn up the sound
[02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:04.620]   Come on Master Chief where ready to roll
[02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:10.460]   Turn left and then turn right
[02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:17.860]   Okay, oh my yeah, Master Chief. Yeah, nice when I first turn it on
[02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:20.780]   He's made some comments about my car and then this
[02:23:22.780 --> 02:23:26.540]   Kind and then the second pick which just came from the chatroom
[02:23:26.540 --> 02:23:29.500]   Internet Archive we love the Internet Archive
[02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:34.740]   This is their 25th anniversary year and of course we'll talk about that later in the year when they actually hit 25
[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:40.220]   But thank you Brewster Kale for creating the Internet Archive. Yeah, and yes, they have
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:43.620]   remastered the first four hours of
[02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:46.260]   MTV
[02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:50.220]   So you can you can watch MTV go live
[02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:56.700]   Is my sound coming through here? It is the rocket you could play this thick they can't take us down
[02:23:56.700 --> 02:23:59.100]   They couldn't take us down for this
[02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:01.540]   That sequencer start this is the launch
[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:04.460]   in 1981 of
[02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:12.300]   Music television which really I think you can say fairly safe change the music industry 14. Yes. Yeah, yeah, it did
[02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:16.940]   My YouTube I would argue yeah, maybe in many ways
[02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:21.420]   Thus we've gone for main engine start we have
[02:24:21.420 --> 02:24:25.980]   And of course the rocket ship and the moon man was the motif
[02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:29.380]   for MTV and the video music which still is
[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:32.300]   Ladies and gentlemen rock and roll
[02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:41.020]   There's the flag on the moon MTV flag. Oh gosh. I remember that sound in my head. Oh my
[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:43.740]   They have the best
[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:45.740]   station IDs
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:47.820]   They put a lot of money in there
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:53.020]   And actually the guy who programmed MTV
[02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:59.980]   End up in later years not at this time and later years end up programming tech TV. So there's a little
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:05.420]   Little blood shared this this this really scares me. So I see a story here
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:11.420]   The original MTV VJs. Where are they now? Where does this story appear next to Leo's story at a ARP
[02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:18.700]   By the way, Adam Curry is the only one who's still around. Listen the first song
[02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:27.900]   Now I will get taken down if I play this the bugles are gonna come after me
[02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:30.620]   How much of this inspired tech TV
[02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:35.980]   I suspect there was some commonality. I mean this this set actually looks like
[02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:41.020]   Some of our sets and stuff greg dreben was his name and I could have seen someone doing a high
[02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:47.260]   Concept pitch for we're gonna do MTV for kicks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:51.180]   Wow, this is fun. I might I might go home and uh
