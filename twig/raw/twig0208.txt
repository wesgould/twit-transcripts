[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.820]   We'll take a look at the Nexus 7
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.400]   Android 4.3 and most importantly will analyze the impact of Google's new Chrome cast device. It's all next on Twig

[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.620]   And so we'll have lots to talk about with Gina, Japan. He from smarter where.org
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.420]   Yeah massive change look yeah
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.820]   founding editor life hacker host of all about Android on this channel and also of
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.040]   her show on five by five and just and
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.220]   a wonderful person also here Jeff Jarvis professor of
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.520]   journalism at the City University of New York, what would Google do in public parts and blogger at Buzz machine
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.500]   Kevin Marks is also here from salesforce.com. He's also been at BT at Apple at Google
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.900]   I can't keep a job. He's worked the guy. I cannot keep a job and
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.100]   We have lots to say I don't
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.940]   Should we start with a change log is that probably the best thing to do huh?
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.580]   Honestly, I put a note in the rundown no change log today. I mean the whole media show is the change log
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.820]   Yeah, the show is the change log, but I think we should probably talk about the announcement
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.300]   Well, just I
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.580]   Thank you. I can't without the trumpets. I just can't and it's not a complete show now now we begin so
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.500]   The the event was billed as breakfast with Sundar Pachai, which is cute
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.240]   Didn't look too crowded. I saw the live stream and I think probably all of us was a big lots of bacon
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.700]   Was there a bunch of huge vats of bacon? Oh
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.520]   Huge vats of it
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.840]   Did I didn't even get an invitation actually to this event? I don't know why not
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.740]   But we did what we always do and I think this is great Google streams at live so we can watch live
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.780]   So Tom Merritt. I asked our Sarah Lane and I did sit and watch it live in fact you can catch that as one of our
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.020]   Twitch specials
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.100]   I think you can watch this great moment where Leo starts on one product. We'll talk about a moment Leo starts
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.060]   He's growling about it and he's got I'll bet it doesn't do this. I'll bet it doesn't do that
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.260]   And it does everything he wants it to do. Yeah, just turns around. Oh, well
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.580]   It was it was it was an interesting product that suddenly became a must-have product. Yeah, we could start
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.580]   We could start with that because I think
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.220]   We'll talk about the Nexus 7 but and jellybean 4 3
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.700]   But really let's kick the show off with a bang and talk about this Chromecast
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.980]   Which stole the show it did last night on all that Android we were talking about all the Nexus 7
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.460]   Respects had leaked we kind of expected Android 4 3 we found some new stuff about Android 4 3
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.460]   But the Chromecast was like whoa cool
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.140]   It's interesting they had no they've had no secrecy on the Moto X
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.220]   They've had no secrecy on the on the Nexus 7 they have secrecy with you on the Moto X but nowhere else
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.300]   No, where else everybody else knows more about it than I do but they
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:59.740]   We only started hearing about Chromecast yesterday because of some strings in jellybean 4.3 that somebody had uncovered and so
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.460]   This is this was unexpected with there have been rumors that there would be a new Google Q and
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.940]   This is obviously it's sure it does have some of the features of the Google Q
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.500]   But this is so much more it's a
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.620]   Looks like a USB thumb drive, but it isn't exactly it has an HDMI port at one end
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.420]   So it requires a television or a playback device with HDMI if you had an MHL port
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.260]   I would presume it would get the power from that but for most people there's a USB port on the other side on the fat
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.660]   Blob end of the of the Chromecast that you'd plug into the wall or if you're lucky enough to have a TV with a USB port
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.580]   you could just plug it right into the TV with a USB port and
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.740]   This thing is
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.660]   Remarkable now at first I thought oh, it's an Android stick. We've seen a few of those
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.260]   Roku even has a stick somewhat like this
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.700]   But it's not what it's doing is very different. It's got Chrome in it
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.940]   Chrome OS and
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:06.020]   What happens is you aren't actually streaming to it as you are for instance when you use airplay on an Apple TV or DLNA with another device
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.780]   You're instructing it from your tablet from your iOS device
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.900]   From your laptop you're instructing it what to play and it does the playing via Wi-Fi
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.500]   Through Google's instructions. So now yeah, it knows everything you choose to play
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.780]   So this is where my concern lay because the first thing they show is YouTube and
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.220]   I think oh great just we need a YouTube key
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.700]   Which was the next is I'm cube problem, which was the could only pull YouTube or Google play right?
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.060]   Go play right
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.140]   So that was less compelling and then they said oh and by the way Netflix oh
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.360]   Okay, so they made a partnership with them
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.300]   He'll perked up at that moment a little bit
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.660]   But now I'm thinking what it's a shame because what I'd really like it to do is play say tweet
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.020]   Why should it just be the big boys? Why should it be Google's own?
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.300]   Property and Netflix people that they can make deals with and then they showed
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.020]   Pandora said oh
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.340]   okay Pandora's coming later by the way and
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.380]   Then they dropped the other shoe and by the way any tab in your chrome browser
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:20.420]   So from now on when you go to a site I guess with pictures or other media including your Google+
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.220]   Photo album there'll be a button in the brow. It looked like was the browser address bar. Yes
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.380]   It's a
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:36.540]   Raw Google cast Chrome extension in the web store right now. Oh, it's an extension. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's me. Oh, what's there now?
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.460]   Let's let's install it. Is it the sender or the receiver the sender. It's yeah, yeah, it's a sender
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.460]   So what that there's a receiver?
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.700]   Well, well the receiver is the hardware, but I guess it could be no because there's a receiver API if you look at the
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.980]   It says you can develop a receive a thing and basically they just look like you know
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:04.100]   You know what that means a half page of HTML that means a any computer display could become a receiver
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.940]   Yes, or if I'm gonna design a smart TV, maybe I'm just gonna say screw it
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.340]   Well, yeah, and build in a receiver for Chrome cast. Yeah
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:20.500]   Why should I bother designing anything? So this has it as as Kevin said it's so you've looked at the API Kevin
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.980]   Yeah, I was just looking at that. They just released that
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.180]   There's a blog post on it and then there's there's the
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:34.200]   Twent of his dot developers dot Google comm slash cast has the on the sender side. Oh, you could add this to
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.180]   Cass don't have to do anything. Our viewers
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.220]   Would merely go to live dot twit TV and if they've installed the Chrome plug-in they'd say send this tab
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.260]   So when you get the whole tab don't you want to just send your player?
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.460]   Yeah, but that's then you can do then you couldn't do that separately. There's an SDK for that
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.300]   Yeah, so we might want to slightly customize
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:02.740]   We would we would we already you know for the third party developers that do our apps on Android and iOS
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:09.740]   I would expect them, you know at some point to add that feature. Is it is it Kevin Marx? Is it web RTC? How is it working?
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.280]   That's what isn't that's what's not clear. That's what I was wondering
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.620]   I suspect it's probably the same back end stuff as being as being used the web RTC
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:24.380]   Which is you know the infrastructure in the in Chrome for that because Chrome has that and that lets you do video and audio capture
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.020]   And also let's use screen capturing so I it's probably the you know the similar plumbing
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.940]   But a different back end and there's a there's a receiver dot JS thing
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.340]   But they've they've put up but it's minified so you can't really work out what it's doing though
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.220]   This is you so built as web RTC now
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.220]   Kevin is YouTube built in web RTC now
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.820]   Not quite the same thing so right where bar TC
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.940]   Had is it is like a it's a technology stack
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.860]   But part of the point of it is is to enable you to do peer-to-peer communication
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:00.580]   So from right one browse to another browser without having to go through a server accept a poke the ports on the way through
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.180]   So I suspect they'll be using that that same model
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:11.060]   I haven't seen anyone say say that it's web RTC, but I I'm assuming there's some there's some overlap between the two of them
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.820]   Google cast is a this is from the developer page is a screen sharing technology
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.540]   Which is not how I would characterize it by the way that let's see you're not really sharing your screen right
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.900]   I'm instructing the screen
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:30.100]   That lets a user send and control content like video from a small computing device like a phone tablet or laptop to a large display
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.380]   Like a television the sender may be a phone or laptop running Android or iOS
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:40.220]   It might be a laptop running Chrome OS Mac OS or Windows a sender application running on the sender device
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.900]   Uses the Google cast API appropriate to its operating system to discover and
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:51.020]   transmit to the receiver application running on the receiver device they implied it was sending URLs
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:59.700]   So if you're logged into a site which requires credentials in order for you to watch a video stream for example
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.180]   Or look at at photos and you send it to the Chrome cast
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.220]   Which as I understood it was a totally separate instance a different computer running Chrome OS
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:16.380]   And I'm not logged into that site on the Chrome cast does it get all my I mean is it able to play that protected content?
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.260]   It says device discovery UX control and credentials are handled on
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.380]   the sending device
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:30.740]   Okay, so all of my credentials and cookie everything that so it's actually a tab try this on your Gina
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.940]   It's it's not actually like a separate instance. It's almost acting like a tab on your Chrome browser
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.900]   Yeah, so it does sound like remote control more like remote control and the chat room saying
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.940]   And I think this is true that during the demo it showed a full page say of pictures from Google Plus
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.180]   But only the media was displayed on the big screen
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.760]   Hmm
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.300]   There
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:11:00.580]   You know I have been sending YouTube videos to my TV for a long time right Google TV has had has had this icon or has had this ability
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.380]   The Nexus Q had this right but it was such a bad experience because right I have to turn on my TV
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.380]   I have to switch to the output or the input which was the Google TV
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:14.100]   I get YouTube loaded up on my phone and then I tap the like center and it would take a few minutes
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.180]   And you see the spiny or whatever that looks like the experience on Chrome cast is way better
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.940]   Chrome cast actually turns your TV on switches to the appropriate input and then loads the so it really does
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:29.100]   And this is the point you made in your post Jeff that I thought was so good is that you can throw out your remote control
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.700]   Well at least for internet and stuff right like your phone or tablet becomes the remote
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:40.940]   Which I which I read it's where it goes the UI on the remote control is the stupidest thing on Earth right?
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.340]   Right, right?
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.740]   This is this is ridiculous and every effort to to recreate this with the screen only makes it worse
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:56.340]   Whereas now if if I'm what it really does is it turns the big TV into the second screen the slave of your internet connected device
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.340]   Yes
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:06.500]   That's what the TV does right and so that's why you can control things and then the whole notion of the remote control
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.260]   Then goes out for anything you watch that way right?
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:15.980]   I would imagine it says you can pause rewind and play from your phone or whatever you started the playback with but
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.780]   You can still get email you can still do other things with the phone
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.940]   Right again. It's like to me the way to think about it. I think is it's just another tab
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.980]   Yeah, it's a background process on the phone right?
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:34.740]   It's unclear you don't see locally you see the tab on your screen and that tab operates in a certain way
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.540]   Just not a for me. I mean actually we think about it
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:46.020]   Yeah, because in in Chrome each tab is a separate process anyway, so they've just right made the inner process communication work across devices
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.820]   Yeah, that's an interesting way of thinking about it. So the Google cast extension
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.260]   Let's you find and play content on your Chrome cast device from your Chrome browser
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:05.620]   When on cast optimized sites, that's a key phrase. That's where the API comes in. That's why you want to optimize your
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:12.620]   Yeah, like YouTube and Netflix you see new options. Okay, so the site would have to be cast aware and
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.180]   Do the full functionality?
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.620]   I think there's there's more than way of doing this. I haven't watched the whole demo
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.900]   But I think there is a screen sharing model, but there is also a pull model which is
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.580]   Rather than share this pull it directly from the source
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.140]   Which is there that was the only thing they had on the queue
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.220]   Which meant that if you wanted to watch a YouTube
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.140]   It had to it then had to pull it from there and you were trying to make the toilet with your phone
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:45.220]   But the the difference is is shifting this from Android based to Chrome based gives them much more flexibility
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.220]   Because Chrome runs on much more things
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.980]   So that the cube is Chrome was Android based which means you can only control
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.900]   Really good point Kevin that and us the Sundar
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:02.300]   Right uber where whereas you know that the point of this is they've explicitly said this already runs on iOS Android and anything
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.100]   It runs Chrome
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.020]   But the other piece that's in the SDK is you can create receivers
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:12.700]   And it looks like you can run a receiver anything that runs Chrome which means you could run it on your Mac or you could run it on
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.220]   a Chrome box or you know
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.460]   Anything else that happens to have Chrome built for it Windows
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.740]   8 whatever
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.100]   So that's that that's interesting. That's basically saying okay
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.260]   We're taking mind of the web platform part of this rather than the Android bit and I suppose that means once
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:35.740]   That version of Chrome gets caught up on Android you could have an Android device as a receiver -
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.620]   Wow
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:43.340]   I mean that struck me it was the thing that struck me the hardest was that this was a Chrome OS device that that kind of
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:49.260]   Left field for me and you know the Chrome cast is successful and how could it not be at 35 bucks and people are buying you know
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.320]   Three four at a time. It's already sold out won't ship till talk a 7th be place order now
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:15:00.140]   If this is successful this means that it's that that the Chrome cast will have beaten out to Android based set top
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.020]   More than two but Google TV and the Nexus Q right I mean right
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:10.780]   I would have never thought I wanted the web on my TV in that way and this is what this is right the web on your TV
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:16.500]   Which was the promise of Google TV right this was the Google TV selling point you get the web on your TV any tab
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.860]   You can open your computer. You can open on your TV. That was the theory, but the implementation was
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:28.180]   Felt short right because ABC calm said oh no, you know what you know with block content and and so forth
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.980]   So you really couldn't get the content that you wanted to watch on your TV this way
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.380]   Right, I was a question you discussed in the coverage Leo is there any
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.980]   There's no way to block this is there
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.980]   well
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.100]   Yes, and we so we were talking about user agent and
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:52.140]   Do they have a different user agent presumably the Chromecast would say I'm a Chromecast and the reason it doesn't have to
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:58.780]   Well, but the reason it would say it's Chromecast is because Google's trying to make deals with these content providers. They're not gonna
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.980]   They're not gonna
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.980]   intentionally bypass
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.780]   They don't want to screw Hulu as much as you we would like them to screw who I'm I know so that's true
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.700]   I think you know, I think what happened before was they had they tried that went down that path that was Google TV
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.820]   Right and Google and they got you know shut down because what they were trying to do was too much
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.100]   They were trying to actually take over the interface been new in the cable box. Yes
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:27.460]   They were trying to commodify searching across the different program delivery models, which is that
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.740]   Pacing the cable box
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.300]   No, no because they were controlled killbooks to so what they're down doing is saying, okay, it's just a web device
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:41.700]   It's not saying you can already do this in effect. Why you can already attach a touch HDMI out to your computer and plug it into the TV
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.900]   You know
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:49.560]   Mark Shellworth just launched his own version of variant of a phone that does this that it's a it's a phone that
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:55.140]   Runs you bond to but if you plug it into TV it becomes a computer. This is this is this is a commodified thing
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.320]   And it's it's gonna be hard to prevent you doing that. You know, I
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.700]   Can take over that. Let's this will make it clearer. This is from the developer page developing a receiver app
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.700]   So this is what the Chromecast device does and any receiver app you'd want to do
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.340]   Applications running on the Google Cast receiver device are always web applications
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:23.140]   They are launched on the device after it receives instructions from the sender application to do so a Chrome browser on the receiver
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.500]   downloads the HTML CSS and JavaScript and renders it a
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.780]   Persistent connection between the sender and receiver is then created and a command channel is opened
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:39.620]   So that's how we maintain the relationship, but the playing is all done on the Google Cast
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:49.740]   The API exposes the ability to transmit commands between the sender and receiver provides structured ways of passing common media functions like play pause stop and volume
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:56.500]   But also allows for app specific free form messages to be transmitted. Wow, that's nice. Oh, that is nice
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:04.860]   Application can be handled for example by requesting an auth token from the sender application using these free form messages
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:11.420]   The API exposes status methods which allow the receiver to push its status to the sender application
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.100]   I can't get a signal
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:21.580]   Whatever as well as to respond to explicit requests for status universal remote controls built into Chrome and Android use this status to display and provide
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.580]   basic pause play and volume controls
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.180]   Hold on this is you know, I have to say already the coverage from a lot of outlets is it's another Apple TV
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.220]   It isn't it's not a Roku. It is it is a completely unique implementation
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:41.540]   That I Apple should have done this well, I this is out of left field. I don't know if anybody's really thought about this
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.300]   It's pretty awesome
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.460]   It's something that's been sort of latent in the
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:54.060]   implications of web RTC because the point there is it lets you construct browser to browser communication, so that's something that
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.780]   Has been you know people have talked about that in that community, but that's you know, that's still a that was still a
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:06.940]   Oh, well, who's going to deploy this question until like this? I think this is pushing that front and center and saying well
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:11.340]   We've got a little thing that'll create a browser window on any attached television and you can
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.700]   Remote control it from your gadgets. It's awesome
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:22.140]   Here's a question for you. I didn't see anything measure with this. What about games in this
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.580]   Well anything you could play in a chrome browser you could play on your TV
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.700]   Yeah, but I'm reminded of yes, I know we saw the five devices together and the car racing
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.100]   The issue is that this probably doesn't have a very heavy processor in it
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:43.660]   Well, I'm assuming it's got um, it's raspberry pie like look what is a raspberry pie 35 bucks
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:49.820]   If you don't want to play 1080p video, you're gonna have a reasonable size processor. Raspberry pie can play 1080p
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.540]   So I would think it's something along those lines
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.980]   Right and and it's interesting the price is the same
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:02.620]   But but I'm thinking about something different here. I'm trying to go to the idea that well that it's germane because the
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:08.700]   The thing that's doing the rendering is the receiver is the is the crumb price
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:15.100]   So that doesn't have enough power to render. I guess you could do server side rendering, but that's what I'm saying Leo is a different question
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:21.660]   Remember how what I owe they had the way that you could have five different devices five different android devices suddenly doing the same game
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.180]   So now imagine you have three friends with you at home
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:32.780]   And you each have an android phone and you're playing and you're using your phones as your controllers for a single game on the big screen
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.420]   I think this allows that
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.620]   Next step it's not not we're not not as presently. Oh, you have to have server side rendering like a guy. Kice kind of
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.100]   Okay, that's what i'm asking. All right, right, we're on live
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.460]   Because you who's doing the rendering it has to be a third
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.740]   Party and not the chromecast because it doesn't have enough juice to do that
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:58.460]   Uh, okay, it's apparently web rtc is supported. So what you you could also do is use your phone as a camera
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:06.300]   I don't know right and your television as your receiver sure. I mean, but they should be basically what Apple's doing with
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:12.780]   Um, uh, what they call it airplane. So anyplace basically just capturing your screen and sending it over as well
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.140]   That's the point is this is completely not dl and a rare play
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.940]   Right those are taking a screen that you're holding and putting it on your tv
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.340]   But you could do that with with web rtc web rtc has right to do that
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.900]   And that's why i'm saying this is important because in this case it isn't a it isn't a
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:35.500]   Mirror of what's on my ipad or even an extended desktop or anything like that
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:41.420]   It is the the tablet is controlling a device which is rendering the video
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.140]   That that chromecast device is doing the work
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.900]   So it's not a airplane at all
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.780]   Um, it is very different from airplay and it's a very interesting kind of, um
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.940]   Concept and you know what it really is it's it's
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:02.300]   Somebody said this on twit and I think this is exactly what we're going to see more and more of
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.740]   We we always think of the computer as monolithic or even i remember asking paul at alenia intel
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.900]   What happens to the computer and this was years ago in this post pc world and he said well you always need the hub
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.260]   You know, you'll always need the smart brain and then the thin clients
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:23.660]   And what we're now seeing is really that what you're really doing is distributing processing power everywhere
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.220]   and you're having interoperative
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.220]   uh inter communications
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.820]   And different things do different things so this grump cast isn't good at a lot of things
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.340]   But one thing it can do is put a 1080p spixer on your screen
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.500]   And you control it from another device there is no hub and yes
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.260]   Google's the hub in this one sense and this was tom maritz observation this morning
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.340]   What is google's percentage in this because they're probably selling this thing at cost
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.820]   They get to see everything everybody does on tv
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.020]   Oh, there's there's that and and I think so much more leo
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.900]   This is what I try to go into is is that is that imagine what this does
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.420]   This allows google
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.220]   There's so many possibilities right google play
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:11.420]   Second run to apple now suddenly you're motivated to buy your shows and buy your movies and buy that stuff here
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.340]   Because you can watch the money and damn device including your big tv one two
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:21.020]   Um, yeah youtube youtube is trying to get all these new channels and figure all this stuff out
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.100]   YouTube is also going to go to a subscription based model for some stuff
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.380]   So it becomes the place where where channels and shows go
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:33.660]   Three you're right google is going to be able to watch so much of no so much of what you watch
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.380]   That becomes an incredible advertising opportunity and google moves past
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:44.460]   Just web ads to video ads which are a higher value and if they're targeted video ads they're
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.100]   explosively higher value
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.300]   Four or five. I don't know where I am the more they know the better
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:57.100]   Uh, I think I don't know whether google's getting a spiff a sales spiff off netflix for the number of subscriptions
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.740]   It's going to sell it wouldn't be surprised if it does well
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:04.780]   They can three months free of netflix 24 dollar value and you're sourced and so you're sourced
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.140]   They know where the new new has come from and so I wouldn't be surprised at all
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.900]   So google ends up getting into a whole new revenue stream here beyond advertising of subscriptions and
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:20.060]   Not only selling its own subs but selling others subs becoming an agent for sales actually if you think about it. Yes
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:27.420]   They probably they're probably they're they can sell us at a loss because they probably make enough money on each new netcat subscriber
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:33.660]   To exactly to support the entire enterprise. Yeah, so they're gonna model they can they become the agent right?
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:38.220]   So look at the what was the model for apple apple wants to send what's the model for amazon, right?
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.940]   They want to sell everybody's content right well google
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.660]   Also wants to be in the advertising business and the sales business and now it's in both with this
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.220]   This just puts them in the middle this works with google play
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:53.020]   So if you rent or buy stuff from google play store, you'll be able to watch it through this by the way
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.380]   Just a quick note and thanks to the chat room amazon does have this
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.060]   uh
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.540]   For prime free shipping 35 dollars ships in one to two days
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.420]   So if you haven't ordered this yet
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:11.020]   And it looks like amazon says it has stock ships from and sold by amazon
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:16.700]   So I guess it may be as friendly they obviously gave you know 20 000 units or whatever to amazon
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.580]   Um, I did buy another one
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.820]   I'm up to five
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.460]   Uh least at least he's on crack
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.420]   No, I think i'm dead. Well, she's gonna get she you're not gonna get any complaints on her. She's gonna get one
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.020]   Uh, they're gonna be all over the place. There could be a couple in the studio
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.940]   The other thing that starts for google is it becomes sorry?
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:47.580]   You know, no, no, I was just gonna say that the netflix deal the three months the free that's also for existing customers. It is
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:52.780]   Yes, you're kidding. Oh, well now i'm really saving bucks. Yes. Yeah, but how are yeah
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:58.620]   Farhad posted this what I find that hard to believe I do too
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:06.060]   Well farhad just tweeted that earlier and i'm saying offer valid for previous new and existing netflix
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.300]   Come only wow so now it's an 11 dollar it costs 11 dollars
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.740]   So now i'm trying to find where it says that on the google page he was
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.780]   It's in the small print says jenny's a it must be in the edit yep, but that's I mean
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.100]   Now well, I just got 15 months free i'm buying three more
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.380]   It's it's your it's your google ponzi scheme
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.060]   Uh
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:39.420]   So what's wrong with this? Why would you I mean for crying out loud if i'm a smart tv maker
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.860]   I'm just immediately removing all the guts of my crappy smart tv apps
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:48.220]   They won't because they make money on it. They put ads on it everything, but you know you might as well support it support it
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.780]   Built to the tv right
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:55.580]   Apple tv does that look like it at 99 bucks at three times the cost
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.300]   crappy deal does it look like a good deal there are channels you can't you can't get on
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:06.620]   This that you can get on apple tv although how long that last i don't know like what sky tv
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:12.220]   Crunchy roll hbo go there's a few things
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:17.980]   No, but I think the thing is that apple tv does something different and more complicated because it works the standalone box
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.460]   It has its own remote you can just use it on its own to watch things
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.700]   Right and that has classes and minuses
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:27.260]   I've had stuff where I try and watch it on the apple tv in Netflix coffees and splatters and I
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.460]   I try it on that make me the answer to attach the same tv and it works
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.780]   So there's you know there's there's there's trade-offs there
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:39.260]   but um that i think that's the thing that this is instead of saying this is a standalone device they're saying this is a special
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.620]   Thing just for moving the web around between devices and the assumption is you have something else to wrote control it
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:50.780]   Which you know apple tv is nicer when you're using an an iphone or an ipad to control it or an ipod
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.660]   Than that it'll um forebutton widget, but you still had to make it well with the forebutton widget
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:02.220]   And so I I there's they're taking the the nicer ux part of apple tv and just just doing that part
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:07.740]   So that's here's the issue for apple. I think I think that apple's model is so much built around
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.060]   selling content
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.900]   Google's model is built around discovery of the whole web
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:19.260]   And this is built on that right I can watch anything on video on the web I can watch with this
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.060]   apple wants to say your their stuff and it's it's it's always in a closed world
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.780]   That's where I think it's brilliant move because it exploits that
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:33.900]   Um, I'm not completely convinced because I think apple's selling content business is not a huge part of their business
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.740]   I mean it's something that's grown
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.500]   Um, but they've they've mostly done those deals where they're not making a lot of turn on that
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:46.940]   And you know the apple tv has youtubers on it as well and and other integrations of web stuff right but right bekevin
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:53.260]   I think I think when it when it comes down what we another fringe benefit of google knowing what we watch is google's recommendations to us
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:57.180]   Google and fake google now are going to become extremely powerful
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:04.620]   And recommendations from anywhere. It doesn't matter google's going to find benefit in that I don't think apple is built to find benefit in that
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.940]   Selling devices at a loss for apple
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.380]   Not so much
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.060]   Apple tv now you're going to buy a special tv that works just with apple
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.060]   Why would you be limited that way?
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.260]   No, I still think that's a myth that this isn't apple is not the shipper tv set
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.260]   That's bonkers and never made any sense, but I think the other thing about this is
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:31.900]   Third party is going to make claims of this because it just helped just runs chrome os which is already available
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:37.100]   Um, and it and it's a little stick with still lots of sticks are available that would have an android
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.860]   So I wouldn't be surprised if there are third party versions of this within you know
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.340]   Uh a month or so
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.540]   And google will be quite happy about that because they want more of them to do it because it's for them
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.860]   What else could it do you think out of the web?
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.580]   Yeah, oh so you could uh, okay, here's a question for you
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:58.060]   So you could then leo put in a more powerful processor. You could do oh, yeah a deluxe version of this
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.060]   You could make your pc could be a receiver
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:05.020]   So does that become I'm gonna go back to the game thing then fine. Does that go back to?
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.300]   Uh the idea of that number one number two
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.260]   Uh conference room communication well somebody suggested in our chat room
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.580]   They're gonna put this on their keychain and that makes a lot of sense
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.140]   That doesn't look awesome
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.580]   Hotels
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.580]   Something you can just hang out with
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.980]   Except i realized you that now it has to have wifi
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.180]   Into the cloud directly. Ah
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.980]   There's a disadvantage right well, that's not a problem you just bring your little router with you
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.620]   Are you ever hard spot?
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.420]   Let's go down for the company's implications
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.740]   So I was on this road trip where I was taking my son to visit universities
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.860]   Um and came which we only had wired internet
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.020]   So I wouldn't have bought a wifi box
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:55.660]   And then carried that around with us and plugged it in the in the hotels that we had so rather than like
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.300]   Individually attach us us eight whatever devices we have between us to the wifi
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.220]   We could just attach the one thing and then use that I've tried that kevin and some hotels
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.100]   Uh nix that they managed to block that
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.900]   Yeah, because they look at the mac addresses
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.500]   um
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   Oh
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.460]   No, I don't know if the ones I use worked but yeah
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.540]   cheaper hotels all right working working hired worked in
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:29.340]   Uh club what's it now the howard johnson didn't have a wired connection didn't have you work all wifi either
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.340]   Oh cheaper hotels always have better internet than the expensive hotels. Isn't that weird
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.740]   Well, it's because they're made of wooden so they can put wifi
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.980]   They're made of sticks
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:45.180]   And guys about this and they said it's really hard for our expensive hotels because they're really well built
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.700]   Yeah, you don't want it to be well built
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:53.420]   You know chipboard and you can just chuck a few base stations in
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:58.780]   Help me out here in terms of the kind of impact on the rest of the industry all right
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.700]   You know, it's what I tried to do when I went through this and what interests me is the whole media industry
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:12.380]   Various oligopolies in tv have been declared dead multiple times and they're and they're not they're still around they're still smart
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.220]   Um, if you're if you're a Comcast, what are you saying today?
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:21.180]   um
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:26.460]   Well, I'm not sure this makes a lot of difference from Comcast from from people watching stuff on their laptop. So we'll
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.380]   Tap the saw it improves cable is cable snipping
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.660]   It's one more way
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.060]   Stip my cable
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.900]   Oh, yeah, it's good for court cutters
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.860]   What it was the people are really excited about this. I think our content creators
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.740]   I think that's the most excited. I think I think channels
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.340]   as
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.860]   Bundlers
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.340]   And cable companies as bundlers of bundles
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.220]   They're they're hurt by this
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.180]   I think cable content creators are helped though though
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.860]   It's going to be very hard to find their audiences and gosh who can help with that but google
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.940]   Um
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:07.660]   So yeah, I think conduct creators should be happy that that they can hope they can have more direct relationships with their audiences
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.620]   They can know who those audiences are getting rid of middle men in terms of revenue getting rid of middle men in terms of data
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:17.900]   That's the good news the bad news is there's no easy path to find a built-in audience
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.300]   Or somebody to write a check to make you to make the show you got to make the show go to the risk yourself
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.700]   Right
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.980]   Um Amazon
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.660]   Yes, what does Amazon think of this?
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:38.140]   Um, I mean this is a different way than watch Amazon instant
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:45.340]   Yeah, I can't watch Amazon instant on my android devices, right? She's one reason I don't get watch it on your apple tv either
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.980]   We should have a tv over there. Yeah
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.620]   Yeah, so just easy way to watch Amazon is I think
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.620]   Yeah, I should try and see but I assume that we're with this the google tv Amazon instant app
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:02.620]   Quote unquote just brings you to the website and like loads of loads of you know a browser and it's kind of slow and stuttery
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.060]   Uh if Chromecast is a little smoother a smoother
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.860]   Experience then this is great for Amazon
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:14.380]   Just means so Amazon selling it is that an indication that Amazon sees this as friendly
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.260]   and um
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:22.620]   That they they're gonna use the api for their for that stuff and and it'll just like I I
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:28.700]   I don't own a Kindle, but I read Kindle constantly on my Nexus 7 same thing. We don't care what device you use
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.700]   We'd like it to sell you a device, but we don't really care
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:36.220]   I think so I will be surprised if Amazon didn't enable cast enable their their instant
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:42.540]   Uh streaming content. I'd be really surprised. Why would they ship to nando? I'd have yet. That's the paid the paid the positive name
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.580]   Yeah, it's true. They haven't all right hulu
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:50.540]   I know why they they haven't I know why I know I know remember how long it took Netflix
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.220]   Remember Netflix didn't have an android app for a long time drm
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:58.540]   Which is which is what they changed in jolly b guess what's in jelly bean?
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:04.140]   Yeah, 4.3. They said they got new drm hooks, which may you know, so that's a like a license implication issue
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.940]   It's like you you want to placate whoever your license in the context exactly
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.940]   Was fascinating to the google presented that as a way to get higher quality video
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.500]   Well, but they couldn't get 10 a p from netflix wouldn't give them 10 a p so it's true
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.540]   All right hulu
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:26.700]   Hulus and the problem is hulus in it flux. It's a moving target because the ownership is in up in the air
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.980]   Well now they've said they're gonna hold on
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.380]   I know and they don't but they still don't agree on it. What kind of service hulu should be right
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.420]   Uh hulu notoriously blocked google tv
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.500]   Right
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.220]   right
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.140]   Uh and I and now that now that I understand that you have to as a web page
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.780]   enable chromecast
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:52.300]   I think you could pretty much that's google's way of saying yeah, and you don't you don't have to look at the user agent
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.860]   Just don't turn it on
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:59.980]   So you don't have to enable it right you I could say you put a web page you can send the tab
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:03.340]   Yeah, that's the question. So you okay
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.740]   How do you send a tab
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.460]   Using this chrome extension
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.620]   No
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.900]   I don't I got the impression the chrome extension doesn't do anything so watch well. I don't have a
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.460]   I thought if you can put a web page on it that you can
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:29.900]   Maybe cost the voices found well maybe my amazon one will come friday like it says it's supposed to and then I can try it and solve it
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.100]   You know
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:37.020]   You can also cast any of your tabs in chrome to your tv letting you enjoy sites photos or videos in the best screen in your home
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.260]   Oh, yeah, I know that this feature is still in beta and requires a fast computer and a Wi-Fi network
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:46.940]   Okay, so you should be able to go to abc.com cbs.com or whatever and even if they haven't
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.420]   Cast enabled just say hey send that tab to some my tv which is awesome
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:56.940]   On the page as part of the page which means which means you're actually doing it the painful way you're doing it like
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:03.180]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, sending where right it's actually compressing your screen at 720p and saying over the wire to the
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:10.060]   Oh, is it? Oh, it's not reopening the address. No, it says you have to have fast, etc. That sounds to me like yes
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:16.460]   Is the tab prediction quality standard for a dp high 720p extreme 720p hybrid rate?
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.300]   Yeah, so basically the maximum they're gonna digitize it in your press it out is 720p
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.380]   So it's not ideal. So it's not okay
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.900]   It's not gonna
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:29.660]   It's not gonna make give you the full resolution of your your chrome pixel on the screen, but it's gonna give you a representation of it
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.220]   All right, so I'm
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:38.220]   It probably wouldn't be great for watching video because you're then decoding and re-encoding and look a bit scabby
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:43.580]   I'm sure google docs powerpoint. It's my third. I'd cruega. Yeah winter is coming Kevin
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:52.620]   I want this thing now. I want this thing now. I cannot wait to watch house of cards on this
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.020]   I was like I when they when they started playing the music I was like oh my god. Bye. Bye. Bye
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:04.620]   You may not you may not publicly distribute or ship your google cast application without written permission from google
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:10.300]   Yeah, okay, so yeah in order to be
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.660]   a rather send or receive you have to have an
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.740]   I approve by google so there is a
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.180]   There they do have a hook there. They have a visa hook
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:23.980]   um
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.580]   So I guess what we would do is go to the app developers for twit for instance and say hey
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:35.660]   You want to put this plug in and it'd be great because then somebody could launch the app. I guess I don't know how this would work
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.140]   Launch the app. Yeah, yeah
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.100]   There'd just be a new button and then be a button on the app says send it to my google cast
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.700]   And then we just show up on the tv and you'd only see the video you wouldn't see the
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.740]   Exactly the widgets
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.940]   And same thing on the web and on the web it's going to be a lot easier, right? I'm sure it's a snippet of javascript or whatever
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.340]   Uh, if it's android
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.780]   It's the native android or iOS app
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:03.740]   They're gonna have to download the sdk and find a place to put the button and uh, but it shouldn't be that big a deal
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:09.500]   If I'm pocket or uh, there's a lot of apps that this would behoove you to enable
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:14.700]   Uh, I'm you know the whole class of apps that would allow you to aggregate videos
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.180]   You can aggregate video into pocket right now
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.220]   And then push a button and just watch your videos on your tv
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:26.140]   Oh, yeah, it makes my to watch queue. Yeah a lot more fun to watch. Yeah
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:32.380]   So the button on the crown browser appears just as all the other buttons do if you have
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.220]   Uh chrome on some devices that you get a lineup of buttons
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:42.780]   Uh on on the uh chrome o s, you know, you get the drop down and so there's there's the chromecast button right here
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.780]   Huh, it's just I installed it on my chrome book and it's just appeared on my desktop chrome as well
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.420]   That's one of the things I love about extensions. That's kind of cool
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.540]   Well, I kind of love it and sometimes it's really annoying. It's like no actually I don't write
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.580]   Yeah, I put a bind on uh on my browser here
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.820]   It's a really extension. I put on the the chrome because now I paid on my mac and it's like no
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.460]   You're chewing up too much CPU go you can control that though. Can't you?
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.620]   Maybe I seems to be like there's a way to I don't know maybe not
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.700]   That would be a good tip for somebody to tell us
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.940]   Yes
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:20.860]   All right, jina classic my standard question. Does this what what does what wheels does this turn your developer mind?
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.220]   Anything
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:28.860]   Uh, you know this I have been fighting with google tv for so long that I'm like just so excited to unplug that thing
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:33.180]   And and get to watch the stuff that I want to watch on my tv this didn't really
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.860]   You don't have to say I haven't had a chance to really look at the api yet, uh, you know
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.940]   The app that I build obviously doesn't have the kind of media
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.140]   You're not gonna offer your to-do list onto the onto the tv that makes no sense
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:47.660]   Uh, so it didn't it didn't really get the developer of me going but it definitely got the tv lover in me going
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:51.420]   I'm pretty i'm just excited about I want to see that this user experience
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:57.420]   You know how fast it is how how how well it goes who's gonna block and who's not who's gonna enable it who isn't
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.340]   um
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:06.060]   I uh, I mean i'm excited. I think I mean I cover android and all about android every week and i'm and i saw a big android
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:13.020]   I'm i'm kind of a little bit bummed for android a little bit that that chrome became the thing that
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:17.500]   That sort of you know became or or at least it looks to me is going to be the device
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.060]   The chrome was gonna be the is gonna be the operating system that powers the device that makes tv watching
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:27.340]   Better but now it all kind of makes sense that the fact that google tv was putting the web on your tv
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.460]   This also this this chrome cast is putting the web on your tv
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.260]   I mean i'm pro web of course
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:37.500]   I like that it's open that anybody can enable it that it works on everything. It just makes a lot of sense
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:45.020]   Uh, yeah, I don't know. I think I think still still still processing otherwise on that point. I saw somebody a week ago
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:50.060]   I was speculating that maybe on our on our google plus group or someplace that
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.900]   um
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:57.100]   Chrome may be may win the day here and android may become the subset run by chrome. No
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:01.180]   I I couldn't understand that I didn't get any sense out of that
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:07.340]   Andre's a full operating system and by the way, it supports chrome
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:12.140]   Right chrome runs on android right android does not run a crumb
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:17.500]   That's why I couldn't figure it out chrome is a full o s and um, no, I think there's some bionic
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:23.500]   I thought it was very interesting at first i thought this is no s. I mean, you know, right? That's an o s with one app
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.460]   Right
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.260]   Right and
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.060]   And we're all gonna run as a web app right?
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:36.940]   Yeah, well that's one app you can you can't install arbitrary apps on chrome o s you can install chrome on it and then
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.180]   Whatever chrome will do you can do
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.540]   Right chrome in a way in that sense is the o s isn't it?
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.500]   Yeah, that's what i'm saying actually
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.500]   Uh
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.580]   So
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:56.380]   It was interesting because when soon when soon dar came out he talked about android and chrome and I thought you mean android and chrome o s
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:01.260]   But really chrome is the chrome is the o s actually yeah
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.220]   Yeah, um, yeah in a sense the chrome book is just a
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.900]   a
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:11.820]   rendition of that a demonstration of that of the power of the bro the browser so this is so somebody in the charm said how
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.300]   Is this better than apple?
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.420]   Airplay it's just different than airplay
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:21.340]   It's different
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.860]   I think it's better. It's more flexible. It has airplay features
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:31.340]   But airplay is deprecated really the idea of taking what's on your screen here and putting on your big screen tv
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:38.300]   That's what airplay does well airplay is two things so airplay is a stream sending api and then later they added the
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.420]   um
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:47.500]   Airplay mirroring is what they call the grabbing the screen and sending it so it was a really both cases isn't the content coming from your mac to the tv
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:53.100]   Yes, yes, and that's what's so different about this. You're not pushing content
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:58.140]   You're you're not pushing content to the google cast the google cast is getting the content on its own
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:02.540]   You're you're just ope you're sending a message to the google cast in most cases
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:07.500]   Saying i want you to play this content and let's establish a link so that i can control your playback
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:12.460]   I have a way of saying stop forward back that kind of thing volume
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.540]   Uh, but the google cast is doing the work that's very different than airplay
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.380]   It does have an airplay like screen mirroring features
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:26.380]   So I can take an arbitrary chrome tab compress it send it over to the google cast and it will play it
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:30.620]   But that seems like that's deprecated almost that's the that's the last thing you'd want to do
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:37.500]   This is so dnla airplay is just a fancy version of dlna dlna and airplay
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:44.460]   Are really ways that a device can put their content on this on the screen wirelessly. It's a wireless
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.260]   Transmission protocol. This is not that
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.540]   And that's why this is interesting because this is
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.220]   Instead of the thin client
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.580]   server
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.460]   Relationship, this is the cpu everywhere
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:05.980]   Concept, yes, which is you cp users. There's smart devices everywhere and you're inter operating nobody's in charge you're inter operating
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:10.780]   Yeah, and i love this because i think in the long run. This is where we're going. That's the future
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.340]   So how do you how do you tie this in then to the internet of things right?
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:19.100]   So if you've now attached a computer to your tv
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:23.740]   Now go to your car and to your refrigerator and your washer and dryer
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:30.220]   Does this does this yield any kind of indication about the architecture of how that could operate or yes exactly the same thing
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:38.540]   I I bet you the I don't know maybe some maybe jina or kevin would like to look at the api. I wonder how abstracted it is
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.300]   Um, does it have it sounds like it's completely abstracted
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:49.260]   That it is what it really is is aware of uh, interrupt a two devices to communicate. It's a way to talk
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:55.020]   I wonder if it's like to do this in my car. I could go into my car and plug in a little dongle
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.820]   And make all this stuff in my mind. Yeah
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:06.060]   Yeah, so push like let's put push this podcast to my car radio that kind of thing but not yeah, and I think it's I think it's even more abstracted than
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.540]   Content
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:14.140]   Yeah, because what you're really doing really all you're doing is you're sending a message to a device
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:21.020]   In this case say play this content from this url, but really you're sending a message device establishing a control
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.780]   uh
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.460]   conversation
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:29.500]   So so I don't know you have to look at how abstract the api is but at a sufficient level of abstraction
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.500]   It's not about content. It's about whatever
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:37.740]   Yeah, and then I mean once you get sensor sensors involved it can be things like it when it gets hot into that room turn the fan on or
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.700]   What happened? Well, so that your analogy before the old is not bad. It really is a raspberry pie
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.500]   Yeah, so for instance your smart washing machine
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.780]   Under you know, it's it's object-oriented programming your smart washing machine understands a certain set of commands
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.700]   And so instead of saying play this video you say wash these clothes
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:47:00.060]   And then establish a link so that when it's done you tell me it's done if you want me to pause like a posit
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:06.220]   From my phone and that kind of thing. That's this if it's at that level of abstraction. They've invented something much more interesting
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:12.380]   Could could I put this OS on raspberry pie? I don't know. Are you asking me for it?
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:16.300]   Does anyone put a crummy into raspberry pie? That's the question
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:20.700]   Uh, oh, I'm sure yeah, yeah, this is on raspberry pie, right?
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:26.460]   So anything you can do there or now you can start to be rethink the only reason I use raspberry pie is that is a device
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:31.820]   Roughly 30 35 dollars. Yeah, that is a full computer has memory has an operating system
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.100]   Uh has storage, you know, all of that stuff
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:40.460]   So the abstraction goes to two levels the abstraction goes to a display level and the command level
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.660]   But don't use the word display
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.420]   Okay
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.180]   an ex-excuse me am I wrong am I giving this too much an execution level and the
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.180]   Command
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:58.620]   You know, that's this is what zigby. This is what z wave do. This is what home automation systems do, right? Yeah, and
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:04.780]   Okay, this is crazy. But what if google's creating back in a backdoor into a home automation system?
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.740]   That's not that's not crazy
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:11.260]   I mean, who is that who's that exact who?
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:17.980]   Andy roman is an Andy roman? Oh, Andy roman back. Yes. He's all into this, isn't he? Yeah, this is his thing, right?
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.900]   I remember android at home and they've shown this kind of stuff
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.060]   Yeah, yeah
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:28.380]   So someone on twitter greg norman said it seems like the chrome android differences are becoming clearer
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:32.940]   Android is an operating system and chrome is a platform for interoperate interoperability
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.300]   Uh, which I think is a is a pretty good distinction
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.340]   I mean, I think we nerds all try to figure out, you know, what what's android's role versus chrome
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.380]   You know chrome's role and the more they blur the lines
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.540]   The more we start try to figure out what's gonna you know is one going to beat out the other?
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:51.420]   Can these two things coexist is there a tension between them?
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:56.300]   That was kind of my fixation about this whole this whole announcement. I mean, yeah, I don't know
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.100]   Operating systems are platforms. That's what an operating system is
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.180]   Right
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.060]   right
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:08.140]   This this pushing this pushing and pulling the chromoting the cloud print this this idea that that chrome is
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:12.700]   You know that you install it extension and it stalls everywhere that it's a push pull that it's aware
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:19.260]   And all tied to your google account. I mean it really does feel more like a platform for interoperability more than more than anything
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.500]   I mean android has some of those characteristics
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.060]   uh, but but
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:29.740]   Leo, I don't think you're taking it too far with the the internet of things which jeff brought up originally
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.540]   I don't think that this the api and its current incarnation
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:37.900]   Is you know necessarily generic enough or addresses these things, but no, I don't I don't think that you're going
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:44.300]   I would note that the api is not called chromecast. It's called google cast google cast. I noticed that too
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:53.580]   Right, so it so it sounds like it's bigger than that product than the chromecast product or maybe they just want to distinguish the api from the hardware
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:50:01.340]   Well, imagine to just the chromecast api. I mean, I don't know they do say google cast is a screen sharing technology
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:08.300]   But I just think it's it could be abstracted to something. Huh? That's a subset of what I can do right? Right? That's yeah
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:16.220]   You know I imagine now I see I go to a lot of places where they use apple to just you know cast their screen up on the on the big screen
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:23.500]   Take this now into the business environment with web rtc with all this stuff and imagine how you change the idea of a shared screen
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.060]   in a space
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.980]   And what you can do with that
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.220]   Right, you did end it in a classroom
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:36.540]   Anybody can can can share something on something that you can now use web rtc and communicate across things
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:42.940]   Then the next thing that gets me interested is can I remote so now i'm i'm controlling actions on the local screen
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:48.140]   What about controlling actions on a remote screen or remote device?
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.980]   That's what the internet thing can come to them. That also becomes very interesting
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:56.220]   And geofencing which is now built in into hardware
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.980]   uh
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.820]   On the new droids in this x8 processor that they're using right
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:10.380]   Um imagine that as you walk through them all the screens change displays on the screen change to welcome you
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:15.820]   Because it's aware of your device. You can see you you're talking to it. Oh, okay, right?
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.420]   Right. Okay. So one of the important technologies here is just that notion of awareness
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:26.460]   When you turn on your device it immediately senses the chromecast and says you want to talk to that
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:31.260]   That's well, and that's what's happening in the chromecast extension right now. It says no cast devices found
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:36.940]   Right, so that's that's already so now there are chromecast devices
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:41.180]   Forget everywhere. They're in your hotel room. They're on the airplane in the seat in front of you
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.940]   They're in
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.580]   I love that. Wait a minute. That's right. Who
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:51.420]   The airplane the airline no longer has to provide content of any kind that just give me a screen with chromecast
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.180]   Yeah
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.860]   Yeah, well, this is this we say about the cars. This is you know, what i've just got a new car
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.060]   Um
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:01.980]   And so it became my job to try and connect everything to it. It's a major pain in the name
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.620]   It's basically a standard install maps and um
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.260]   The car's doing its own voice recognition
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.700]   I'm and i'm just sitting there going
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:13.020]   I just want this phone to connect to that screen and to that microphone and then i'll be done
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:16.220]   But I can't do that. I have to go through an entire are they
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.860]   OS running on the car, which is really annoying
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:22.300]   Um, so yeah, I can see this making much more sense
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:29.100]   You know down the line and down another product cycle of the car manufacturer where you know, you just have a way to send stuff to the car
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:33.340]   Now apple has been pushing something like that. They've been some announcements. I was seven
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.740]   I have a seven staff
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:38.220]   Yeah, um and they will have it that baked into some manufacturers
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.700]   But it's the same problem as like baking in the iPod connector
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:45.740]   Um, you have this problem that oh we have this great connector that you can you can plug iplers into except
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:49.740]   Even apple doesn't make those anymore. Um, and so you will stack with this connector in your car
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.540]   You've got like dse chain dongles into it attach other things to
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:53:00.300]   I also see great hacks for it. I can imagine somebody hacking a times square giant display with one of these things
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:06.220]   As long as you get a couple of messages in the HDMI port
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:09.980]   Because i'll better just wanted the back
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.980]   We're just gonna just get around plugging things to hz
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.300]   HMI ports and bars and just taking over the screen. It'll be fun
[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:16.940]   Well, that's good. I like that
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:23.180]   Well, anyway, so uh, it's clear that the that the surprise the stealth part of this announcement would something completely unexpected was this
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:26.540]   uh chromecast device $35
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.980]   Again, the tip is go to amazon. It looks like you can buy it and get it friday
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:36.300]   I mean basically a usb stick upstage a new version of android and a new nexus seven think about that
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:39.900]   A little stick with the chrome logo just
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.260]   Both of the other the other two major announcements
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:48.540]   It is cool something about it. I just like I only wish hdmi were powered
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:52.700]   So you wouldn't have to plug in the darn usb. Well, it is some some variants of it
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:59.180]   Oh, I think it is an mhl port and that's it was an interesting choice on google's part. So the roku stick
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.220]   Uh gets its power from the htmi port
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:06.860]   But you have to have this special kind of mhl port with some some tv's are starting to ship now
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:10.700]   I have it on my own receiver so I plug it in there and it's powered
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:16.380]   Um, and I think I would be I'm very curious to see if there is mhl support built into this
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:22.460]   Um, they may not have mentioned it, but what if it did because you I mean it would be nice not to have to plug in the usb
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:27.100]   Power as well. It may also be a needed more power than mhl would provide. I'm not sure what the yep
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:30.780]   That's a that's a good point. Our spec is a computer. Yeah for all it is a computer. Yeah
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.180]   Um very interesting
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.100]   Very interesting
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:43.340]   Poor android was fun. Yeah, it was lots of fun. We're gonna take a break. Come back. That was part one
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.700]   There's more nexus seven jelly bean 4.3
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.900]   And uh, I suppose there's also some news. I don't know
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:57.580]   Chatham chatham keeps telling me so I will say this a power dongle is provided with the chromecast device
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:01.020]   Uh, but you don't need it because it's a micro usb port
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:04.140]   So anything you probably have about 800 of those cables and power
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.700]   Adaptors lying around it's the same thing that powers all the smartphones and so forth
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.740]   um
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:23.100]   Yeah, now the amazon order for chromecast is ship is this is july 30th. So I guess amazon sold out of them too
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:29.660]   Do you know whether they did they give away these things at the event?
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:34.540]   Uh, they didn't mention anything did they that's why they cut off the signal so fast
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.940]   Yeah, then then he then he's all of them was saying. Oh, I put one with me. I'm complaining to the enemy
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.980]   Oh, no, man. We should have gone
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:47.740]   Yeah, I put on the rundown there were there was some unboxing of both the uh
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.660]   Chromecast there's lots of questions there lots of questions
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:57.340]   Uh about uh, you know, what exactly is this how exactly does this work? Yeah, yeah
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:01.260]   Look, there you go
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.540]   It's a box we did did anybody here get an invitation this event
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:09.580]   Nope. No, no, I didn't either. What are we doing wrong? It's called this weekend?
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:11.660]   Google
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.660]   It's very strange
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.980]   Very strange
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.980]   Plug it in switch in
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:21.740]   So it doesn't switch the input somebody was saying it turns on the tv and switches the input
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:26.300]   I think I think leo nut will set up. That's to get it set up. Oh just to get it set up
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:31.180]   Maybe I don't know. I don't think most tv's
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:35.260]   Well, wait a minute. No, there are some TVs that you can control the tv from the
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:38.620]   Uh, they did talk. I thought they said they said that during the
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:42.380]   You need to have tv with that capability. Yeah, okay. Yeah
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:47.420]   Not all not all tv's you have to have see what's called cec
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:51.820]   There's also most new tv's most new tv's have cmc cec
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.380]   New as in like last couple of years. Yeah
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:57.820]   You're looking. Yeah
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:02.460]   Yeah, you're gonna want to buy a new tv to my second tv for this 35 dollar device
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:13.260]   If you're a tv manufacturer go back to them if you're a tv manufacturer if you're if you're a samson and sony
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.980]   Are you building this thing in?
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:24.380]   Well, I mentioned that I mean I think that they make money on their smart tv products. I you know my uh panasonic vira has advertising
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.860]   Playing back. Yeah, and so forth. Uh, they probably also do
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:32.380]   License deals. I know we samson approach doesn't set
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:38.300]   For a small percentage of your total revenue. We'd be glad to include your app in the samsonk tv's in europe
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:42.220]   And we said no, thank you. Well, what are the best of the question? Different way leo
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:46.540]   What happens to the manufacturers who are still pumping out google tv tv's?
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:51.900]   They're gone right what what does happen to google tv? Is it uh, is it dead? It's dead, right?
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:57.020]   It's a it's a very different thing. I mean, it's not yeah doesn't do the same thing at all
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:02.700]   Right, uh for one thing it is but the cell was the web on your tv and what do you need?
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:04.700]   Google tv's yeah, what do you need?
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:05.820]   Yeah, yeah
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:09.020]   One of the advantages of google tv is you didn't need a separate hdmi port
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:12.300]   You it was a pass-through device. So you just plug your cable box into it and then
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.940]   Into the tv but uh, right?
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.460]   But then you had to have like a cable as remote control and a whole bunch of weird stuff. Yeah
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:21.020]   Now this is so far superior
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:25.180]   Uh, nd in his chat and the chat room says my three-year-old samsonk has cec
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:29.260]   He in fact controls it with xp mc on his raspberries pie
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:32.940]   Now that's showing off
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:34.780]   So cake
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:39.580]   Uh, it's been part of the spec since hdmi 1.2. So it's fairly common. Okay
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:43.260]   Uh, I know I know all the tv's that I
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:48.140]   I think all my tv's have it. Yeah, maybe my oldest one does not I think my oldest one does not
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.220]   So
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.220]   Welcome, let's get you set up and watching
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:59.340]   So this is if you go to the website. Thanks for downloading the app verify install run where you find this chat is this on?
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:07.020]   So on the unboxing video there was yeah, there was a URL that's so go to google.com/chromecast/setup
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:13.260]   Would do this on your device as opposed to does this mean that I can like seriously airplane my computer
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:20.540]   Wait a minute. What's going on? There's a there's an app called chromecast. Yeah, I need a hey
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:26.940]   A mac a mac. Yeah, this is a mac app mac app. Yes
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.820]   What I know I know
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:34.940]   Which that?
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:40.220]   Well, I mean it's certainly in the api that anything can be a sender you don't or receiver
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.620]   They they emphasize that this is works on iOS
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.980]   No, but this is a mac app
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:47.580]   So
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:53.260]   Chromecast you have from oh, no, you still want the chromecast what it's looking for your it's looking for in the chromecast
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:56.300]   So this is an app that runs on the macintosh that lets you
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.660]   Talk to the chromecast as opposed to the google chrome
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:06.700]   Extension so this would be in lieu of an extension. You could do both obviously so there's a windows app and a mac app as well
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:11.020]   The sender we thought the sender would be chrome, but it's not just chrome
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.980]   Right, and it's interesting. It looks like if you have a usb on your tv
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:22.220]   Yeah, that's what I that's what I will do because I do have a usb it's right now. It's charging the unuse 3d glasses
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:27.980]   So i'll just take those off talk about a dead technology
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:32.940]   But they're charged in case I ever want to watch
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:38.220]   What's the security on this one if if you know the old porn question?
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.980]   So somebody comes into the room and they want to stream porn to your tv
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:49.420]   How do you own your wifi network so that's what it is. Okay. All right, just depends is a good porn
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.420]   No, they could be on it. Well, I see
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:57.580]   No, they don't Kevin google tv developers on google plus with the exciting news about chromecast
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.260]   We're getting off a lot of questions mostly wondering if google tv is dead
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.780]   No
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.340]   In fact partners are continuing to launch new google tv enabled ht tv's and boxes
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.860]   LG right had google tv built in as we announced at i/o
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.780]   We're working with partners to bring the latest experience of android and chroma devices later this year
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:20.700]   We believe there is ample room for both products to exist and succeed. That's from the google tv group
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:25.820]   Now, okay. What's your what's your countdown? How long before the announcement that google tv is dead?
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:31.180]   I give it six months half they got more uses than google reader
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:35.980]   At the rate at which google's cutting products the fact that they didn't
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:42.700]   Uh, sunset google tv. Yeah, that's interesting. They've got contracts. They got deals. They got deals with lg
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:48.700]   You know, they're manufacturers. They've got to keep supporting it. They've got to do it gently here gently gently gently gently
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.540]   Do not want to basically they're gonna want those guys to say okay fine
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:55.340]   We want to be releasing this contract so we can use this other thing instead
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:01.100]   All right, we're gonna talk about the retina ipad. I mean the retina next to seven in just a second

[01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:03.420]   So the nexus seven I I resurrected my old nexus seven what that this was an amazing deal 200 bucks
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:07.100]   for a 12 80 by 800 tablet
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.540]   um
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.660]   in over the uh, it's about a year old over the
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:20.380]   Months, it's you know, I've got all the apps on here. I want I have to say in the early days of android tablets back when we were running ice cream sandwich
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:27.500]   Um, it was not present pleasant. It wasn't it wasn't in fact even before that. What was the first tablet operating system? I was it was a
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.860]   honeycomb
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.300]   Honey crab
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:36.380]   And there was there was a tablet before that the the samson galaxy tab which I had but it was an awkward affair
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.260]   But that but in a few or they remember the zoom motor row zoom
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.140]   But in a few years literally in just a few years
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.940]   Uh, not only is the tablet come of age, but I got to wonder why anybody would buy an iPad
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.820]   Um, you know somebody was saying well, there's no
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:55.260]   You gotta get the comments. That's a big statement. I'm serious now. I'm really sincere
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:05:01.180]   So this is 229 dollars for the new nexus seven. It's retina apple said oh, we can't do retina
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.420]   And give you good battery life or a reasonable price in a seven inch
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.420]   Uh, well google can somehow magically
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:15.740]   Uh, they claim nine hours watching hd movies 10 hour battery life good battery life great screen
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:23.100]   Um, they've claimed a big improvement in both a processor speed and a 4x improvement in gpu speed
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.940]   They're going to need it to push all those pixels
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:30.380]   Um, I you know something's weird has happened with the nexus seven also managed factored by a susan original one
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:35.340]   Is it's got a little sluggish over time? I don't know if you have you noticed that jeff. It's just no
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:38.380]   And maybe it's i don't know maybe it's the new o s
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.820]   Uh, maybe i don't know but but what what I have noticed is
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:48.300]   Absolute apo parody there is no reason to think that you're giving up anything
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.660]   Moving from an iPad to a and red tab
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.700]   You were giving up that flex but no more
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.020]   Right
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:00.300]   Um, I you know i'm looking at all the apps I use they're all there
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:05.100]   One thing people say oh, well there there aren't as many tablet specific apps a i'm not sure that's true
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.180]   But be uh androids scales
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:14.540]   Smaller apps much better than the iphone the iphone apps on an ipad are ugly. They bring up an iphone keyboard
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:20.700]   Uh, they're scaled now. That's going to be a little bit better in ios 7 the scaling anyway, but they'll still bring up an iphone keyboard
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.580]   Not so on an Android this is i have really huge round about this
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.540]   um
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.020]   Just before the apple developer conference, which is that
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:32.380]   Um, there's still this weird fragmentation on iris where you either write an iphone app or an ipad app
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:35.340]   Right and they kind of pretend that there are only two screen sizes
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:38.700]   Um, and then they launched the ipad mini, but they didn't change anything
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:42.140]   So you're either running the iphone app doubled up
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:47.260]   Um, all you're running the ipad app shrunk down and either way the buttons are the wrong size
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.460]   I mean, it's exactly what Steve jobs said you have to find your fingers down
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:56.300]   Because if you're running the ipad app and the ipad mini all the buttons are just that you know half the size that they were on the
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:02.460]   As designed and that's that's that's a structural problem. I know I think they're going to fix that with seven a lot of what they've said on seven
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:07.100]   Is now they're going to fix the resolution issues, but they're still going to have a phone keyboard on there
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:10.300]   Which I think is a is a bad thing. I haven't
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.620]   I haven't seen seven running on a
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:19.180]   I've been told I don't have it of course because I didn't sign the nda but those who have used it say no no it doesn't change the keyboard
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.060]   It's the same bad iphone keyboard
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:29.900]   But I also argue that they may fix that but but the thing is maybe how doing in seven is they are changing the layout engine encouraging you to rewrite your apps
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:36.220]   So you get the shiny new layout possibilities and variable size fonts and things and that will give them the ability to create different size screens
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:41.980]   Needless to say let me for instance. This is an app that's called glide. It's very just suddenly got became very popular
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:49.260]   On the i i phone to ipad it'll scale. It's ugly. There isn't a android tablet version. However, the scaling is great
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:53.900]   It works just fine. It looks good the fonts look good. It's totally usable. I don't have a two x button
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.900]   If I want a keyboard, I have a keyboard that is completely normal
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.580]   You know, I I don't understand I think this
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:07.020]   To answer the question they do a I guess it doesn't rotate then maybe that's specific to this
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:11.500]   Maybe it's switched off. Oh, I do have I always switch it off because it drives me crazy rotation locked
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:17.020]   So I have to say that in my opinion. I think it may just be app specific
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.660]   In my opinion the
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.220]   Tablet issue is is no longer an android
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.340]   So if you don't have a major app advantage on ipad
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:31.100]   You've got features on this that the that apple does not give you and may not give you this year
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.700]   And it's 229 bucks. It's under bucks less
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.940]   Yeah, yeah, that's it. It's a strong argument. Why would you buy an ipad?
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:45.900]   Well, you buy an ipad if you bought into the apple system and you like the apple show up and so and that's that's the
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.900]   Trauma is that's the only reason now. Yeah
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:53.740]   I I don't the other reason I I've said it's before the trouble for but I emphasize that my boy is mine dirty
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.660]   Um
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:01.020]   Is seven inches versus eight inches is a big difference to me the seven inches is a huge benefit
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.420]   It's it fits in the hand. It fits in the pocket
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:07.500]   Uh, this is the right size. I'm comparing this directly to the ipad mini
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:12.860]   Yeah, so the ipad mini same size. It's a little different aspect ratio. It's a little bit lighter a little bit thinner
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:16.140]   It's in the same ballpark as the new nexus seven
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:20.220]   Um, but it's more expensive and it's not retina and I have to say
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.060]   uh
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.420]   You know apple it seems everybody said oh you just can't do retina
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:29.980]   And get the same battery life for keep the cost down. Well, I think google's just said yeah, you can
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:34.300]   Yeah, you can't three. I think it's what is it 330 dpi on this
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:40.860]   I don't know. Yeah, maybe the ipad screen's a little bit bigger. I don't know
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:47.820]   It's well, it's physically bigger, but it has fewer pixels and it's so it's had it has the ipad mini has fewer pixels than the
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:53.100]   It's 1024 by 768. It's terrible. It's not even 1080p. Yeah, it's not even 720p. No
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.780]   um
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.780]   whereas, you know this
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.940]   More pieces is better than this is this is gonna be nice. I guess it is 720, but it's not 1080
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.740]   So 24 by 768 right?
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:08.780]   Yeah, but that but that but it should be 12 ad. Oh, yeah, because it's not wide you're right. It's for three. Yeah. Yeah
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.500]   um
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:15.340]   I don't know. I just uh, I think that if you're looking if you're in the market for seven inch
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:20.060]   And here and and uh, you want retina. It's just just an obrainer
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:24.460]   It a year ago. You couldn't say that because the apps maybe weren't there and so forth, but
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.260]   I think you can say it now
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:29.980]   I know what we've been watching saturday in a couple of months. We know that well
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:34.780]   But what the rumors are and this will be interesting that there is no mini this year that they aren't going to update the mini
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:39.100]   So that's what that's what will be interesting. I think they're going to have to do a mini
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.620]   Yeah
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:43.820]   But you know if it's on the pipeline, it's not in the pipeline and there many has sold really well
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.260]   The iPad mini has been right. There's no there's no issue. There's no pressure
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:53.820]   Because which is a form factor thing this form factor is a really good is a really good size. You know, yeah, I like seven
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:58.780]   Um amazon showed that with a kindle. Yeah, we had it with a nook. It's it's it makes sense
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.940]   It's it's a it's a you can actually hold it in one hand
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:03.660]   On public transit, which you can't do with it, right?
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:07.820]   And I think no and I think you'll remember when I first got this next to seven. It was a revelation to me
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.500]   I said this is the right size
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.060]   Yeah
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:15.420]   Many many agree actually that apple it may be starting to think that the mini is its future form factor going forward
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:20.700]   Which of course jobs may be a part of it kevin you're obviously right when I see people now on the subway holding an iPad
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.700]   It looks so big and horsey
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.420]   It does a big silly. Yeah, what is that thing?
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:29.020]   Also, you can't hold on to the post on the iPad
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:36.140]   The new next is a little thinner, right? They took they cut some of the bells on the side
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:43.100]   Yeah, it's got cameras front and back too, which five megapixels. It's not a huge camera, but five megapixels pretty good
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.420]   That's all the
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:49.900]   Speakers wireless charging dual speakers. It hasn't she does it have wireless charging?
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.860]   Okay, that's interesting
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:55.820]   And it's 229 for the 16 gig
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:58.220]   Wi-Fi version
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:02.700]   269 for 32 gigs. That's a pretty good price for 32 gigs. It is
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:08.300]   It's got stereo speakers on the back. It's got they call it frown-off us a loud sound
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:15.180]   Yeah, he's laughing when they when they make a big deal that the doe be surround or frown-off or surround in these little cheesy speakers, but
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:25.420]   My problem is I want the LTE and I got to wait. Yeah
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.580]   And it's running new version of jelly bean
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:38.140]   And we're three still waiting for that update
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:46.060]   Four three, what do you want to talk about the one thing I saw with four three in an unboxing is that if you
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:51.580]   Uh go to the uh about page and tap four three a bunch of times you get a jelly bean game. That's cool
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:58.220]   Oh, yeah, isn't that that's in isn't that in this? Yeah, that's in oh, I never saw it
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:06.220]   Yeah, I had never seen it either. I just discovered a couple weeks ago. Oh, wow. You're kidding. Okay, so I I tapped the android version a bunch of times
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.700]   Oh, yeah
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.820]   It's not a bit. I got it. Tap tap the bean
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:16.940]   Click and hold or click. Yeah, okay. Tap and hold. Yeah, you all knew this and you didn't tell me
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:21.660]   I just found out a couple weeks being cleaner. Yeah, there you go
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:27.340]   How could nobody so I see I thought there's a new feature for three until that's not new in four three
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.660]   What is new in four three
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:34.700]   Restricted profiles. I you know, I thought this was especially valuable for education
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:39.500]   Obviously anybody with a kid's gonna want this because you can keep your kid from buying stuff and seeing stuff
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:46.300]   You don't want him to see but for education having multiple users on a single inexpensive tablet makes these also very compelling
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:52.540]   Yeah, yeah, the restricted profiles. It was interesting. I'm actually not sure and I should look into the android API a little bit
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:54.540]   If you have to tailor your app and say
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.260]   Uh, you know an ad that permission logic in your app
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:02.060]   It seems like maybe I mean the example that they gave is if you have a restricted profile for your kid
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:07.020]   And you know you buy your kid a game and there's all these in-app purchases and you buy your kid
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:12.300]   You know a couple of levels when your kid logs on he only sees the levels that you purchased that's got it
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.780]   That's got to require programming on the game, right?
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:19.100]   Because it's not necessarily going to be logged in with a play account
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:24.380]   So if they basically just blocking the play account for those things well, you could I mean the the least they would do is say
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.700]   Hey, you can't you see those levels you can't get them
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:31.820]   Right, but to change the UI would require the game having some logic
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.380]   But you'll just find the button doesn't work right?
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.580]   I think actually works the demo
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.420]   So at least the button won't work
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.540]   But even better what doesn't even show those the kid doesn't know they exist
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.180]   So the kid doesn't know right because your kid's gonna come to you and say hey
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.580]   Can you buy me this level right the fact that it didn't show it at all?
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.380]   That's fair enough. I mean, yeah, I don't mind that so much as the kid
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.020]   My stuff
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:56.780]   Also, I do feel like there's an education just happened. It's like a month later
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:59.180]   It's like why have I just been built $400 by Google?
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:01.660]   Yeah, I totally had that between with with iowess
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:05.340]   Did you yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, iowess it was in it was notorious in fact apple
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:09.100]   Had to do a had a class action lawsuit and had to give people settlements based on that
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.620]   Yeah, and I just got wet there in the mail. Yeah, you get what five bucks or something?
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:15.980]   Yeah, thank you
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.220]   NSA base security
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.420]   What?
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.460]   Yes
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:23.260]   No, that's a good thing people say what is it?
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.420]   I'll now I gotta find it
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.020]   NSA base all right while you're looking
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:27.740]   There's a place
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:32.460]   There's definitely education push for this they they mentioned all the textbook partners that are offering textbooks
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:35.820]   For android we know chrome OS is very popular in schools
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:40.380]   I think that's a good one-two punch that an android tablet is right in some cases
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.820]   If you have multiple logins one classroom could share several tablets
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:48.460]   Textbooks make more sense on a touch screen. I think than they do on a Chromebook
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.740]   It also solves a problem that Chromebook has in my opinion of
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:56.220]   writing a paper on your Chromebook and wanting to look at sources and stuff
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:00.300]   Since it's not a windowing environment or not a very well done windowing environment kind of hard to do
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.900]   But if you had a tablet and your Chromebook that makes sense your textbooks on here
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.900]   You're writing your paper on there
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:09.580]   I think that this is smart. I think Google's making a lot of sense on this
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.140]   Also for three has lens flare. Yeah
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:17.420]   This is this is web gl
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:22.060]   Open gl open gl they mentioned jj Abrams
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:26.460]   Yeah, yeah, giving that lens flare effect and then and like the the dirty camera
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.820]   This is all inside games
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:31.740]   I don't know that the camera may have been the dirty camera lens may have been part of it before
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:36.220]   But the lens flare effect is kind of interesting and new shadows and faces just making more realistic
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:38.700]   characters and games
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:42.780]   I just I just thought it was funny that that they were calling it the jj
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:48.540]   I just put it in the rundown chat. Leo. Okay
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:51.740]   Now all I have to do is look at the rundown
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.900]   Am I um
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:58.620]   Business week security enhanced nsa android nsa edition. This is
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:01.340]   Treating better right up. That's the one I found
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:02.220]   Um
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:07.340]   Mark millian. No mark millian knows his stuff tech giants listed as part of the national security agencies brian
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:12.620]   Spying program although prying programs probably also appropriate prism have gone to some lengths to convince the world
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:17.820]   They aren't in bed with the government. Yes. Yep. Skip those first skip skip skip through its open source android project
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:22.860]   Google has agreed to incorporate code first developed by the nsa in 2011
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:30.460]   Known as security enhancements for android isolates apps to prevent hackers and marketers from gaining access
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:35.580]   To personal corporate data stored in advice. I think people don't know this but the nsa has very good page
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:38.060]   Number of pages on how to secure your stuff
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:43.340]   Really good security advice for windows and mac users and so forth at the nsa page and I guess
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:45.980]   They also offered some code to google
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:52.940]   Uh all new phones tablets televisions cars and other devices that rely on android will include nsa code
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:57.900]   And doesn't have the same meaning it used to have I know the nsa tech
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:00.060]   Is a difference between nsa
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:05.020]   And nsa contributes to your open source project right? Yeah, so this is open source code
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.900]   Yes, that's why it's good seem to be okay
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:11.740]   Yeah, so you can review the code so you can know what it's doing and this is good
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.740]   They they've decided to uh
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:19.420]   One of the ways to promote security u.s. Security our national security is to make sure people aren't getting hacked
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:25.340]   Apple on the other hand does not accept source code from any government agencies
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:32.780]   How do they know? Excuse me? No, that's a statement from apple
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:39.100]   Contributing to webkit. Well, that's true. They it doesn't it's just me some guy, right?
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:43.020]   They take code only for friends. It's only pretty enough
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:47.980]   Right. It is an open source project. Darwin is an open source project. It does get into the uh
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:50.620]   It's kind of an source project sort of certifurp source
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:56.060]   But webkit is so I imagine that you know, they may take webkit contributions for other people too
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.700]   so
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:18:59.900]   Handwave, I mean, yeah
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:04.540]   There's a big difference between government demanding to inject code which operating system when it's a closed source thing
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:09.020]   Right and government sending pull requests you that you can decide to incorporate that actually
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:13.420]   Yeah, I think it's actually why shouldn't the nsa participate in open source projects
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:19.740]   But i'm waiting for the first idiot reporting to say oh my god nsa is now on all your android phones
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:25.180]   I guarantee it
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:31.100]   Now you in your google plus post jeff and I took a issue with it says google you said google demoted
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:37.020]   Your television set into a second screen of slave to your phone tablet or laptop. I think I said it's a promotion
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:42.380]   It means you can do more with your television set. It doesn't do less. It does more well, but
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:46.220]   Well, well, I got some trying to say is that the tv
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.780]   Um and cable box combo
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:54.940]   No longer control the world you control the world from this well, that's being true ever since we have you know
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.940]   Yeah, it was broke good to that too. Yeah
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:04.620]   It's certainly a good thing for cord cutters. Absolutely, but it doesn't it doesn't give cord cutters more capabilities than they had yesterday
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:11.660]   Right because i carry this in my bag so that I can plug my laptop into into tv sets when I go to a hotel
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:16.380]   Right in there. It's just more it's more a convenience thing than it is uh capability thing
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:19.420]   I carried us a rubbish in my bags
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:27.180]   But I will see the advantages though that like it's gonna like I think I think Jeff's point like if everyone has a chromecast
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:34.060]   Which why wouldn't you because it's 35 dollars and it's the web and people content creators like twit care enough to add the little
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:40.060]   You know send to your chromecast button then suddenly that becomes an easy cheap standard portable way
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.500]   To watch the web on your tv. I think this is right
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:50.060]   This is the difference between this and roku or this and google tv or this or you know watching that flix on your xbox or whatever
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:54.460]   Right as I said, this is the second order piece of this is you'll be able to watch the web on your web
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:59.580]   So you've able to watch this on any other place that runs chrome too. That that's also part of that
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:04.780]   That's it's um explicitly said in the stk thing. They haven't shipped anything that does that yet
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:07.180]   But that's that's gonna that's gonna make sense too
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:11.180]   I think this is great. I mean, uh, yeah, i'm i'm all for it
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:15.740]   And it is it does it's a lot easier for us as a entity
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:23.340]   To support this than it is to support a samsonk smart tv somebody has to write a dedicated app for a samsonk smart tv that's unique
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:29.340]   There it is. Yeah complicated and proprietary whereas we can add code to our I think
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:37.740]   My understanding is we could add code to our web page or to our player that automatically understands this and handles it properly. I think that's the case
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.700]   And of course our third party apps
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:43.420]   Can also be updated to do that
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:49.420]   I yeah, I'm I love it. I'm excited. I just don't think it really it changes the landscape all that much
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:55.020]   It's just not it's just great. It's 35 dollars is a big deal. Well, you really oh no, that's where we do disagree then
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:58.140]   I think it changes the landscape of the industry potentially again
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:00.780]   People have declared tv dead before
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:05.340]   But jean is pointing exactly right if at this price with google's emotional power
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.980]   This gets to critical mass
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:12.460]   Uh, and I want to watch the show x and I can't get it this way
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:17.820]   I have to go through all that old fashioned stuff my cable box and that kind of stuff that potentially changes the business
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:23.660]   And and the tv as the center of things the tv is just another that's why I said it's another slave
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.180]   Yeah, I can watch this here. I can watch it there. I'll put the show over there
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:31.820]   It's no longer than I have we all have to go and sit in the same room with the damn box and do the whole thing
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:35.500]   You know and cables been going that way where I can watch stuff from different rooms
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:41.500]   Like yeah, man. You and if you have a rokor and apple tv you can do that. I mean I don't have to have a cable
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:44.620]   How many people uh of fewer than google reader
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:48.620]   How about rokor apple tv?
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:55.580]   Yeah, no, no, I don't think no no apple t what was the last sales figures for apple tv tens of millions
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:58.140]   Really? Oh, yeah
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.740]   And there also is that promotional power of you know my sister who's not in a tech at all
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:05.820]   Goes to a web page with streaming video and sees this button that says watch this on your tv
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:10.860]   Yeah, and she's like what's that? Oh, I could send this to my how do I oh 35 bucks
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:13.180]   You know
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:15.500]   Is this button already?
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.900]   Do you see the button if you don't have the plug-in?
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:22.860]   That's I mean, that's a good question. I don't know if google was smart you do
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:28.140]   Right? Yeah, you want to know what's that what's this button? Oh, I can watch us on my tv. How do I do that?
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:34.620]   Oh, I need this dongle. Okay. Yeah. Well, it's certainly it's a low friction cost entry
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:37.660]   But you also do need a device. You need a computer
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:43.340]   So 13 million apple tv's have been sold 5 million roku
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:49.020]   So a total of 18 million roku and apple tv users and that doesn't include boxy boxes and all the other
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.540]   devices, you know, maybe it's maybe it's 15 million
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:56.140]   I don't think google's gonna sell 15 million of these
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.700]   Maybe
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.700]   I don't know. I mean it depends. I mean if the courses of surfing the web using chrome you that you
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:07.420]   The idea is imprinted upon your brain that you can just send whatever you're washing to your tv
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.340]   I don't know. That's like that's incredible. It's very powerful. I don't think that's the barrier
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.820]   I think the barrier is it's people don't
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.860]   People don't know how to use their stuff
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:23.820]   Yeah, I think that's true. You can't I don't care if it's 35 bucks. I have to do what I plug it in where I have to do this
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.740]   It's the flag of 12 problem. Yeah, I I think that's the barrier. It's not
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:30.860]   It's not price or functionality. It's just that
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:33.820]   Most people just want to turn on the tv and watch okra
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:38.220]   Right, right, right, but the discoverability right like no one's gonna know about the roku unless you kind of
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:42.860]   Run into it the the discoverability of like what's this button? Hey, can you I could see my brother calling me
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.500]   But like hey, what's this watching tv thing? Can you hook this up for me?
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:50.060]   You know it sounds like I can't see my mom my kids
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:55.340]   I can't see anybody in my family saying that if they saw the button and press the button and it said watch this on your tv
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:25:00.140]   Really? Yeah
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.900]   Well first of all my kids would just watch it on the computer
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:11.020]   They they're I mean you want to talk about deprecation of the television. That's what happened. It's people watch it on their computer
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.140]   Yeah, they don't care if it's on the tv or not
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:20.780]   Yeah, but your kids don't you kids hang out in the living room and pass around phones and tablets watching youtube videos when they do
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:25.900]   In fact, henry was mad when I took out the google tv said I how can I watch youtube on the tv now?
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.980]   Exactly exactly
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:33.180]   Be cool if their friends could just flick a youtube video or whatever to the to the tv and they could kind of watch together
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:38.940]   That may sell it that may sell if he goes over to kids house and he says dad they all had this on their phone
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:45.420]   And they were just putting their videos back when we do that on this tv. I could say I wish I wish I could just text henry right now
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:47.420]   And see what is he seen this and what he is?
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:52.620]   He is this is the next is cute right like this with the self the next is cute the social media
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:58.540]   You know not social media. I made it alias on his apple on his mac and touch. I made an a I set up dropbox
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:00.860]   I made an alias for him. He said, how do you know all this?
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:07.820]   [Laughter]
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:11.500]   And that's not in any way a slam on henry. I think he's completely normal
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:17.020]   Yeah, we assume as geeks that people know all this stuff and then you go in a house and they go, how do you use a remote?
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:21.100]   Well, no, I got in the house. No, how do you use a remote? That's
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:26.060]   That's not a key thing. That's like remote. So really bad. We're both are terrible
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:29.180]   Terrible
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:33.500]   Well, I don't know if this is any less complicated than using a remote
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:36.540]   But it's a browser it's a button and a browser
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:39.900]   Leo as soon as it's built into TVs
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:42.940]   Which it's gonna be
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:48.220]   More I think about it Google is gonna do deals. This is gonna be building the tv. So there it is. So you have that you have a Google
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:51.340]   It'll take you
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:57.980]   Okay now they're now I'm gonna pull up another stat if I can find enough how many people use these smart features in their television
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:59.500]   um
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:06.380]   A survey says and what do you want to you want to make a guess fewer than half of people want a tv set that comes with apps to stream
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.700]   Content have connected their tv directly to the internet
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:14.780]   They haven't even connected it. I did it once and looked at this and said why the hell would I ever do this crap?
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:19.260]   Right. Yeah, and I plugged my I plugged the ethernet into my tv is like, well, what did I just gain? I didn't see anything
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:24.540]   80% uh people do not own a smart and only with software updates smart tv penetration is tiny
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:31.020]   Uh of the four and five people who don't own a smart tv only a third expressed any interest in buying one
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:37.180]   I want a dumb tv. I want my tv to be dumb. I want to plug into it what I want to plug into it
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.180]   I don't even want a tuner. I want a monitor
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.540]   Yeah, I'll tell it what to play dammit
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:46.700]   Is that the wrong attitude? No, I think that's the right attitude
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:50.220]   There's a new thing to plug into my tv every couple of years. I'm only gonna buy a new tv
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:53.500]   I'm cheating. No, you're right. You every 10 years, you know, so
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:58.300]   I don't want to look at anybody else now what if okay
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:04.060]   Uh, remember Skype is being now introduced into every dam product in the world including tv's
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:09.660]   What if this starts to have uh, what if this has web rtc and suddenly you can make video calls?
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:14.940]   Yeah, uh, what if it what more what more features as a camera
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.740]   Doesn't have a camera. Remind so but this does
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:22.380]   Yes, okay. Oh, am I connect my phone?
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:30.300]   And you connect uh, well, that's what microsoft's putting skype into xbox one for that reason. That makes a lot of sense, right?
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:34.220]   Sure. This changes conferencing in offices too
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:40.300]   We'll put more teas in that's I mean, that's basically already happened in our office because everyone has an ipad
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:42.860]   And we so we use apple tv and nobody plays anything in it
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:49.100]   So that's that that's the transition has happened at salesforce where everyone has an ipad because they're doing
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:54.380]   Presentations and things and the way you plug it into the into the projector is oh, there's an apple tv in the room
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:29:00.060]   And you just find it bob mcc bob poses an interesting point. Uh, he says he's got a usb point port
[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.060]   Are you saying that the usb's only?
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:07.260]   For power maybe there's some other stuff going on there. I don't know what else it could be
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:11.020]   Mmm
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:16.300]   A camera a camera mike mike. Oh, yeah, just essentially
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.540]   Yeah, maybe
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:24.220]   We'll find out we're gonna get one. We're gonna take it apart. We're gonna put it under the microscope
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:26.940]   We're gonna get it to reveal all its secrets
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:30.140]   We're gonna waterboard the damn thing
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:32.540]   Okay, chrome cast
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:35.180]   That's oh, oh
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.180]   Okay
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:43.340]   Okay, now you're talking you're right you put a connect like device with a camera and a microphone and now I could talk to it
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:48.940]   Well, there's this to playhouse of cards. Yeah, that's my what's that?
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:54.700]   Although leap so have you played with it? No, I just I will of course doesn't work my Chromebook so
[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:58.220]   I gotta go back to my antiquated Mac
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:01.900]   Yeah, we got like five of them. They sent us they got we got overload
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:09.020]   Uh, I played with it. I played with it on the mac prick weekly yesterday. I'm told that I I showed my lack of ability
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:10.620]   Um
[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:15.180]   Maybe because there were so many lights in here that it wasn't super functional, but um, it's okay
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:20.860]   What is that thing it lets you gesture at your screen? Oh, gotcha
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:26.300]   That looks really graceful Leo. Yeah, maybe that's my problem
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:32.940]   All I need to do is wear your google glass while doing that. I was a dancer in an earlier life and I'm too graceful
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:41.740]   Well, there is a that's a but there is a valuable thing
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:46.860]   Which is the old classic media lab thing of put that there where if he's actually see what you're pointing at
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:51.900]   Then you can say, you know put that there and move the thing from this
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:55.020]   Yeah
[01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:57.020]   And that
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:00.540]   All right, let's uh, that's part of what?
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:03.100]   Pick some stories
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:08.380]   Any stories? Yeah, there's some stories. I don't know if we wanted this the guy brings a guy
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:11.500]   Okay, this is a joke guy brings a google glass into a strip club
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:16.220]   What's the punch line? I don't know the bouncer says that's cool
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:20.220]   Enjoy
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.940]   Enjoy our lovely ladies and I find there's a video

[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:42.940]   Man gets in a strip club wearing google glass. Doesn't that guy look like a bouncer though? They're great. Hey, what do you want?
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:50.780]   He fascinates the doorman with his device so much. He's allowed into a New York strip club wearing it. He clamored the guy
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:54.860]   That's all very silly
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:57.980]   Does it say what club not that I know any of them
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:02.780]   Quick caveat. How much is it?
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:06.380]   Is it free to get in?
[01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:09.900]   All right, great. Thank you. What is this? What do you have with that google glass?
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.700]   Oh, it's yeah

[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:26.300]   Oh

[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:41.500]   We're playing with these guys at the moment when in contest to be able to buy on right now
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.260]   1500 bucks
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:48.220]   But when it comes out for the for the regular public it's gonna be it's gonna be like five 600 bucks
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:55.100]   And you know maybe the AT&T or subsidizing

[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:52.220]   Just shows you the high security environment that a New York strip club is
[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:58.060]   Like oh you must have a lot of money spent on the girl. That's right. Would you like to visit our champagne room?
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:03.420]   Come on

[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.780]   That's a good question. I wonder how well it sells. It looks horsey. Yeah horsey. It's horsey
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:23.580]   Wouldn't it be amazing if Google goes primarily the seven inch and Apple goes primarily to the 10 inch? I think everybody's going seven
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:27.580]   Let me check my update see if four threes out yet. Nope
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:30.540]   No, I'm not either
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:34.060]   We haven't even mentioned Google's second quarter results
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:35.260]   uh
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:41.260]   14 one billion in revenue net income in a quarter in three months of 3.2 billion dollars
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:44.060]   They missed estimates
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:45.740]   they missed estimates
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:48.060]   And the with all the announcements today
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:52.620]   Hold on here. We're by the way just to show you how yeah, Google stocks down
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:58.140]   Down 10 cents and apple stock is up 5% because apple exceeded estimates
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.860]   It has nothing to do with anything except that no
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:08.300]   They're freaking estimates. How did you do compared to the estimate? I don't understand it myself, but that's why I don't buy stock
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:12.540]   Um, I'm not gonna talk about the moto x once again
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:15.340]   Because you can't
[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:18.140]   Once again, I will say nothing
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.700]   But we're gonna but this is the last time I don't have to say anything because
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:25.100]   Oh, no, that's not true. No, that's not true. I'm sorry because
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:28.940]   Uh, it's august 1st is a Thursday. So we got one speaking at which
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:32.940]   I tried to I I sent guy kawasaki who you think is mr
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:38.220]   Mr. Google plus a message on google plus never got a response to see whether I can get an invite to the new york event
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:45.500]   That's right because of the valings in new york. Oh, you should be there. Jeff. Let me let me send a note to my friend guy
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:50.620]   See if I could get you in there. Yeah, we gotta get twiggy. Are you wear google glass?
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:53.660]   Uh sure
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.540]   How much that caused you
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:01.420]   Uh, what time do we don't know what time and it's a thursday. So are you gonna be in New York? Dang
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:06.780]   Uh, no, no, I was just wondering like if I may not be able to have a family thing. Well, I won't
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:09.580]   if I do
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:11.740]   I
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:16.700]   All right, here's the headline I love. I'll see see you there. Uh, I don't thank you. Mr. Jeffrey
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:20.380]   NSA says that it can't search its own email
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:25.660]   Only hours. That's under other
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:28.860]   Uh, wait a minute. What?
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:31.340]   What?
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:37.020]   No, what? These were these were foyer requests and they asked for researchers of email and then they say, you know, we would be bullish
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.020]   That capability
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:47.420]   We have to cover the NSA to have it search the other way. We saved it all into our AOL file cabinet and uh, we cannot search it now
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:51.580]   That's just bizarre. Isn't that
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:57.900]   They have no sense of irony. There's no central method assertion email this time with the way our records are set up
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:02.460]   Unfortunately, that's intentional actually I would guess that that is that's you know, if you can't do it
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:07.180]   You can't uh can't respond to you for your request. I don't have the capability so they intentionally
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:09.740]   They flip to switch
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:16.700]   You saw we talked about it on security now the uh the memo that went out to all a department of homeland security
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:23.660]   Uh staffers. Did you see that it said the washington post has published a top secret slide
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:29.260]   On its website for the prism slide. This is the one that they published the new slide that nobody'd seen last week. I guess
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:33.420]   Whatever you do do not click on that link because if you do
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:40.140]   You will have upgraded the security clearance of your computer and you'll have to report it and you could get in trouble
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:45.580]   So even though this has been published by the washington post and is is everybody's seen it now?
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:49.420]   It's still top secret and so by looking at it on your computer
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:54.060]   You would be triggering a whole thing. You don't want to know it's a mess
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.700]   So don't be
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:02.300]   Because the computer would automatically detect that that's contact that was more top secret
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:08.220]   Oh, of course not but you just you just have to tell them because you did it. It's a protocol. It's not a
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:14.220]   It's just nonsense. Oh, okay. Oh, I thought there was a kind of crazy invisible layer of technology
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:18.700]   Yeah, it's like pixel matching for top secret classified documents. I mean, how would they know?
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:26.060]   Whoa, well may it does say doc it does say top secret on it. You know the way this was written. I should it Bruce snire
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:30.540]   Had this on his blog. Let me let me see if I can read it to you
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:33.100]   And you you tell me
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:36.220]   The shinire on security is at schnei
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:38.940]   Er.com
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:40.940]   Let me scroll down to that story
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:44.300]   Oh, he's wonderful. I love him and he's been all over this
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:50.140]   Oh, like it's too late in the too far down. I guess
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:52.380]   Oh, here it is
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.020]   uh sent thursday july 11th 2013
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:02.140]   I have been advised that this article is on the washington post website today and has a clickable link
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:06.940]   Title the nsa slide you've never seen that must not be opened
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:13.500]   This link opens up a classified document which will raise the classification level of your unclassified workstation
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:17.740]   To the classification of the slide, which is reported to be top secret
[01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:24.540]   This has been verified by our mission partner and the reason for this email if you opened on your home or work computer
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:31.020]   You are obligated to report this to the sso as your computer could then be considered a classified workstation
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:37.260]   Honor system honor system. Let's report it
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:41.260]   And you could be subject to administrative or legal action from the government
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:48.540]   It's a threat to your systems your tax dollars at one believable
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.620]   believable
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:52.620]   uh, okay, so there's all our stories
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:59.500]   Five rise of phios rolls out of 500 mega mega bit tier time you get the 500 mega bit right
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.820]   Half the speed of google and four times the price
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:07.260]   299 dollars a month for this are we paying for it Tom?
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:13.340]   Yeah apparently we are
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:19.020]   Why not you'll enjoy it
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:24.700]   No, we should pay for it. We're using it
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:28.220]   We'll pay for the amount that we use
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:30.860]   to send us a bill
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:34.300]   and uh, david cameron has announced in the uk that uh
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:38.140]   Everybody in england's gonna gonna be a ban from porn
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:43.020]   You have to opt into porn now talk about a privacy violation from government
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:46.460]   And if you identify yourself as a porn user
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:50.620]   Yeah, this by the end of the month. He says all the major isp's in britain
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:55.020]   are going to be filtering your feed for porn
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:59.340]   And uh, if you want it, you have to say so they're gonna give you a little switch
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:02.700]   Uh, but the default is no porn
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:07.980]   Well, that's that's what the argument's about so what they um what they have
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:11.660]   Previously done is what they called active choice, which means you've got us to say
[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:19.500]   Fill to me or don't filter me on sign up. Um, and now the government is arguing that the filter me checkbox should be checked by default
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:23.180]   So if you do nothing, you will see no more
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:25.740]   Other nonsense wrapped up in this as well. This is this is just much
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:31.100]   The funny thing is that the the the home safe porn filtering system that
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:35.740]   One of the isp's in britain uses is is made by china's wallway
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:39.340]   Just by the chinese military
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:43.100]   But they know they're porn
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:48.780]   They don't want to see it. That's right. No my my colleagues at the open rights group in uk have been
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:53.740]   very strong on this and you know do whatever the media explaining why this is stupid, but
[01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:59.980]   It's still a challenge and I think a lot of it is actually just you know, there was a leaked letter from the
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:04.860]   Prime Minister's office to the isp saying we're gonna make this announcement
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:10.620]   But you don't have to change anything, but we're gonna gonna say that this is this is a new policy and that's okay, right?
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.980]   Um and that somebody leaked that like two days before the speech
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:16.380]   because they're basically trying to
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.140]   um, yeah, get
[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:20.460]   um the daily mail is patting on the bag and
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:26.460]   Get the um because the daily mail started a campaign to do this right exactly
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:31.500]   I think it's mostly because they don't want people to see page three of the sun
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:35.340]   What are he?
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:38.300]   I said no with the page three the sun is still fine. It's like what?
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:43.420]   There are there are there are there are good breasts and bad breasts. You gotta decide which ones were both
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:46.300]   Wait a minute very strange
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:50.780]   David Cameron said I will never support a ban on topless images on page three of the sun
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:53.580]   I will never I cannot support that
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:57.500]   So that you know, and there's there's a lot of stupid conflating going on here
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:00.460]   So there's there's some structural stuff that they that you know
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:07.180]   Tracking down images of child pornography and prosecuting people who create them and all that that is going on
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:13.740]   Um as you're going for a while and all the all the internet companies um cooperate with um interpolent people on that
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:17.180]   Um that is being conflated with blocking
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:20.620]   um children from seeing pornography, right
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:25.340]   Um and they bounce back and forth when they're talking about it and make it very very confusing
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:27.420]   And this is you know
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:34.940]   one is uh, this is evidence of a crime scene and then the other is these these this is adults um behaving consenting ways and
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:37.660]   Can you you limit people's access to that?
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:42.460]   Yeah, that's that's much harder and then the third one is oh and then we want to
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:47.900]   Turn on filtering by default on the internet so that children don't accidentally stumble across things which is
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:49.340]   um
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:50.300]   You know
[01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:56.940]   There's there's a sort of mythical piece of that but they're all coming like tied up in a in a incoherent knot by the the media
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:02.700]   Did you follow and this is going way off our topic, but that's what we do. Louise mench former mp
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:07.500]   In New York. I I caught one part of a twitter conversation where she went
[01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:10.700]   I could be wrong and don't sue me miss mench
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:14.700]   But it seemed to be saying that you can't eliminate rape
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:19.100]   From the net because it's a common fantasy of women. It was it was
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:22.780]   so
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:26.780]   Well, there was there was a part of this was saying already
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:34.460]   Um, you know child abuse photographs is um our our band because they're crimes
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:36.860]   um, we should ban video of
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:41.660]   Actual video of rape from the net and that's that's that's fair enough. That's also
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:46.140]   Evidence of a crime with if there's what's going on you should use that to prosecute people
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:52.060]   It's that that's that's reasonable, but then it was and then there's and you should ban ban depictions of rape
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:57.020]   Um, and then it gets then it gets into like dubious territory then you're banning, you know
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:59.820]   Part of the collection of that
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:02.140]   was fantasy
[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:04.140]   Right, but that's the but you
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:09.340]   Um, the argument I think that this came because there was a rather horrific child abduction
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:15.340]   Rape murder that happened in in the uk and the judge said and he was watching these videos on the internet
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.540]   That inspired him to do this which oh that all argument
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:19.340]   Right
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:23.580]   So that so then there are a bunch of people in the uk saying we need to make sure there isn't
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:27.580]   Um videos that show this this kind of thing, but then if you get into the
[01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:30.060]   You know problem of which of these you know
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:36.460]   If they are actually children, then it is already illegal if they're adults pretending to be children
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:40.540]   It's legal, but you know, okay, it's kind of sorted, but there's there's lots of that out there
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:45.740]   Um, and you know that it gets into a very messy conversation very very quickly
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:47.500]   And it's not
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:51.340]   You know, no one in the uk has been having a very coherent conversation about this
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:56.780]   No, but they are trying to put on censorship by default and this has been a problem already with mobile phones in the uk
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:58.540]   mobile phones
[01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:04.300]   By default um have some kind of filtering on because I I brought up sim when I went over there and found
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:07.100]   I couldn't get to flicker because it was built it out
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:10.860]   Geez, and you have to ring them up and say can you turn the filter off, please?
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:14.220]   So yeah, there's there is some some
[01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:18.540]   Structural idiocy there and it needs to be shown up for what it is
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:21.340]   But it's but it is very hard because they are using they're conflating
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:23.740]   You know, they're using these
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:27.420]   horrific child rape cases as their hook that they hang the rest of us on
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:30.060]   Don't they know the Puritans left England?
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:35.020]   This is why it's so difficult as soon as you start censoring
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:37.740]   It just becomes a m-a mire
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:42.940]   That happened before so there was there is there is a censorship list in the uk that was designed to block
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:44.460]   um
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:49.020]   Images of chompromorrh there is a blacklist that is that the isp's um sign up to use
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:51.580]   And run by the idw t I think
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:53.740]   um and last year
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:56.780]   There was a court case where they were trying to block a
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:47:01.660]   Parroting site and they were forced by the the government to add the pirate site to that list
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:06.140]   So they've already done the well, you're already blocking the pawn so you should be able to block the the pirate site
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:09.580]   Right thing so that that slippery slope has has slipped
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:12.380]   Yes, every slope has slipped
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:15.420]   Slotted
[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:17.420]   And we're all sliding downhill now
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:22.300]   Let us uh, let us wrap things up. It's time for Gina Trapani's tip
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:24.700]   Jeff's number my tool of the week Gina
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:32.780]   Gmail uh people who use gmell's web app if you don't like the new compose window
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:37.260]   Which is that kind of that small window that shows up in the bottom right hand corner of your of your screen
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:40.300]   Uh, you can now expand it and go full screen with it
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:44.700]   Uh, you'll see that there are little arrows to expand the uh the window and it'll and it'll fill your page
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:48.620]   And then if you want to keep that your default that you can set it as your default as well
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:49.980]   There's an option there in the bottom, right?
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:53.500]   So for those of us who don't like typing into a tiny little compose window
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:58.540]   This is a nice upgrade for uh for gmail users. I think this is rolling out now. I see it in my account
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:01.260]   very cool
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:06.940]   Full screen compose full screen compose whereas it's it's a an old technology new again
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:12.380]   Who wants to see all those windows in the background all that
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:18.780]   Listen, you can't get straight my emails man. I need full screen to express myself. No distraction
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:20.620]   no distraction
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:22.620]   jeff do you have a uh
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:26.140]   A number of the link all right. Well, I got one which is google is going to pay
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:30.220]   $600,000 to provide free wi-fi and 31 San Francisco parks and we've
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:34.620]   Google was going to try to provide wi-fi across the city. They never got a contract
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:40.460]   It's a mess so it's a step in that way, but I say why San Francisco. Why don't you go to New York? We're nicer. Isn't doesn't uh
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:44.860]   Everybody have one pocket. Yeah, wasn't it washing the square park have free wife? Yeah, we got some boy
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:46.460]   Do we have some brine park brine square
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:49.660]   Yeah, yeah, it's good. No, I'll do a shout out a
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:52.700]   Friend of many tech folks jeff polver
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:57.740]   Uh who helped start the vape industry who does the 140 conference other things founded vonic show
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:59.660]   Exactly
[01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:05.020]   Uh decided that he wanted to bypass the bypass who's gonna get gastric bypass and and he reports now
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:08.300]   He's lost 93 pounds 10 inches on his waist he can do one
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:12.380]   Armed push-ups and he can actually play basketball with his kid
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:16.540]   So I just want to give a shot Jeff. Yeah nice this guy's on earth and give him a shout out good for jeff
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:20.620]   It's great. Yeah, everybody go to congrats. He's got a new startup
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:25.100]   Yes, he does what's saying about is it on their voice? It's a group. It's a kind of group
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:30.700]   Company working thing, but I think it's still stealthy business business to business
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:33.900]   I think so
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:38.540]   Um, I don't know what tip I should uh, I should do I found a program
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:42.940]   I thought this was kind of cool called CPU z. This is a free program that will give you I was
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:48.380]   I was trying to remember what was in that what was the processor in the uh, and the um
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:56.220]   Nexus 7 CPU z is a very handy little, uh, uh app that uh, we've had on pcs for ages
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:50:06.780]   But we'll tell you all sorts of internal stuff about your hardware iphone. I'm sorry android phone or uh android tablet manufacturer motherboard
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:10.620]   Display and hardware ids android version, but also
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:17.340]   Uh information oops it crashed information about battery life, uh screen resolution dpi
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:20.940]   It's a it's a very handy little program and it's free cpu
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:23.820]   dash z
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:25.180]   And uh
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:30.540]   You can even see a processor which processors are working. I kind of like this the sensors thing
[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:34.140]   It's really cool the sensors. I don't know how well you can see this in a galaxy s4
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:39.020]   But remember the galaxy s4 has all sorts of weird sensors. You can see the sensors respond
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:42.220]   What did I do? Do the crash?
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:43.260]   It went dark
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:47.820]   You can see the sensors respond you could see it here too as we move things around and so forth
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:49.820]   I guess this is a little bit of a crashy
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:52.460]   Perks funny because I've been using it for a while and haven't had any crashes
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:54.940]   um
[01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:58.380]   But the galaxy s4 has humidity sensors
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:01.260]   It has the weirdest set of sensors ever
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:08.460]   So I can see for instance that it's 549 lux of light in here that the relative humidity is 33.8
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:15.180]   It's 25.5 degrees centigrade as I rotate things. It shows you the real-time rotation
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:20.140]   Um the magnetic field we are it's 37.2
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.780]   micro teas
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:24.780]   Whatever that is
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:28.300]   Isn't that what look at all the sensors on this thing the NSA thanks you
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:32.140]   Yeah, this is all stuff frankly they could be gathering
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:36.940]   They could know that it's 39.5 relative humidity in my armpit today
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:43.980]   So just in case you want to know what they know here's all that information
[01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:47.580]   All right. Well, well, you tie that into chrome cast and it's gonna
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:54.140]   Target the ads and give you a builder an ad there you go on the tv. Oh your humidity is very high leo
[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.780]   Yes
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:58.780]   Yes, CPU load
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:00.700]   Uh, you could see how each core is operating
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:05.580]   It's actually kind of fun because you can see the clock speeds go up and down as the uh, cpu responds to
[01:52:05.580 --> 01:52:12.380]   Demand and then down clocks down and all these all these arm cpu's are responsive to the amount of uh work that they have to do
[01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:14.540]   Sometimes they even shut themselves off
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:16.940]   CPU z it's free
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:23.420]   Uh, all right. All right. I've got one. Yes, Jeff. Oh, Mark. Uh, Kevin marks. Yes. Go ahead
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:30.060]   Mark, so my tip is very simple one. There's a site called defund at the nsa.com. Yes, there's a vote today
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:38.780]   Um, that's amending the defense appropriations bill to remove the funding of the nsa to collect telephone call records
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.220]   Under the patreon act it would just be the phone records, but hey, that's a start
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:43.660]   Yes
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:48.380]   Well, no, not just the phone records, but all the stuff they're like their giant phishing exhibition expedition stuff
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:49.820]   No, I thought it was just the phone
[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:55.020]   Wasn't it yeah because it's not defunding the nsa, which by the way has a massive top secret budget
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:53:00.140]   Budget. Yeah, uh, but this I think this is sunset. It's one of the it's only sunsetting the
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:03.340]   Domestic phone surveillance. I don't know what it is
[01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:06.860]   But yeah, go go defund the nsa
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:10.620]   So basically what you need to do is go there put it in a zip code
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:15.900]   Call your congressman and say please vote against this and you got to do it on the phone. No emails. No twitters
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:19.100]   No emails. No twitters

[01:54:56.460 --> 01:55:01.420]   Yeah, that's good. That's good news review. We're a little bit worried that uh the manufacturers might hold it up
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:06.620]   There was a variant there so very soon not soon very soon. Not just soon not in weeks

[01:55:56.060 --> 01:56:00.860]   Did you see the uh chapotle uh tweet uh storm yesterday?
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:04.380]   What the heck
[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:05.740]   What?
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:11.340]   Happened should I ask yes? Uh, all right. Let me find it because of course i'm sure it's all been deleted
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:15.100]   Uh, they say their account was hacked. It doesn't sound like it was hacked
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:18.700]   So the first tweet was just found it
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:21.660]   And then
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:25.180]   Awamit i guess i'm doing this backwards. So let's start with the first one the first one was twitter
[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:28.060]   Then twitter friends search bar
[01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:33.660]   Then do i have a tweet then twitter find avocado store and arv
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:36.620]   Then hit send too soon
[01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:41.260]   Then it said find avocado store in arvada, calorado and then found it
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:45.340]   And then chapotle tweets
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:47.740]   Actually, this was media mediaite
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:53.020]   Who uh who said chapotle tweets has been hacked apparently by a stoner who really wants an avocado
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:57.100]   I just 13 password leave
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:57:00.300]   That's the funniest one
[01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:03.100]   Um
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:07.820]   It looks like a demo gone terribly wrong mittens 13 password leave
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:14.460]   Yeah, but that didn't work that didn't uh, it's yeah, it's very strange. I don't know what's is that a
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:17.260]   attempt to get attention
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:18.300]   I
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:20.620]   230 000 followers here's what i'm thinking
[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:23.100]   Give him credit for keeping them all up and just saying hey, sorry
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:28.540]   We had a little problem with our account. I think they're using some sort of social media tool, you know, who's sweet type tool
[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:34.380]   And well, you can see it from the post for you. Yeah, and somebody somebody was typing and they were in the wrong window
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:37.660]   And they weren't getting the results they wanted
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:40.380]   They were doing uh, so that's what they're like
[01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:45.980]   Mitten's 13 password leave is the funniest one if he asked me. I don't know what maybe not
[01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:49.980]   Maybe it was this publicity stunt. It's a strange publicity stunt. It is
[01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:57.500]   It advertises cluelessness more than anything. That's what I think I don't think you do this on purpose. Yeah, yeah
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:01.740]   I should have got this a number of the week. I there was a calculation of how many different
[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:05.340]   Uh, it's like 300 000 different ways you can order a burrito
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:12.940]   I lost it though. No, that's all right. You can keep it. It would have been uh
[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:17.180]   Uh, hi, sweetie. Can you pick up some lime salt and onions twitter?
[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:19.020]   That's
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:26.140]   It's just it's just weird. You know what horse horse ebooks got ahold of it and it's just not been the same ever since it's some sort of strange
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:31.980]   Uh, people are saying it's their 20th anniversary, but I don't you know, I don't think this is the way you would want to gain attention
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:33.980]   It makes you sound strange
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:36.540]   Maybe Anthony weeder is looking for a job
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:42.780]   Mashable has an interview has he pulled out yet? No, well, bad working
[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:47.660]   Z pulled one out
[01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:49.660]   I couldn't resist
[01:58:54.780 --> 01:59:01.340]   Sorry, gee, yeah, I got with boys. Oh boys. I you know I literally have been holding on to that for two hours
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:06.860]   I just I didn't think name was was less suggestive Carlos danger
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:12.460]   Now we can create our own Carlos danger names, you know, there's a Carlos danger name generator
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:19.100]   Is there a Carlos danger twitter account? I haven't looked well. It's not anymore. I'm sure they've they've taken it
[01:59:19.100 --> 01:59:22.060]   Somebody must have started new one. I'm sure yeah
[01:59:22.060 --> 01:59:24.700]   um
[01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:30.460]   Slate magazine had the story. Uh, let me see if I can find the link to the name generator. Maybe it's a maybe it's well here we go
[01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:33.180]   Uh, let's see first name Gina
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:39.660]   Last name trip Annie. Let's see what her Carlos danger. You should be alfonso dynamite
[01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:49.260]   Uh
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:53.660]   Jeff Jarvis you should be victor clandestine. Oh, oh, I like that
[01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:59.660]   Let's go George George decay was on the rerun of how was turned yesterday and he said he used to have a nom de gay
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:03.020]   He called it in the bathhouses. Oh wow. Oh my oh my
[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:07.900]   Greg. Oh my was it filipé stealth because that's yours Kevin mucks
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:15.420]   All right, it's yours. What's yours leo? Oh, I was waiting for you to ask let me enter leo loport into the
[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:17.420]   Anthony wiener
[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:19.020]   twitter
[02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:23.260]   numbed agare generator and press get my name and it's armando risk
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:26.060]   [laughter]
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:28.060]   Somebody actually used time to do this
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:33.500]   Sad thing doesn't take long. You know what I can't find developers
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:36.780]   Gina you're gonna hack this out in 10 minutes admit it
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:40.940]   It's a pretty simple, but yeah, no, it does take some time
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:48.300]   You know, hey, you know, you can watch tv or you can make a name generator, you know, you just need a linked list of names. It's easy
[02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:52.140]   All right, Fabrizio smash
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:54.140]   [laughter]
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:58.540]   Hey, thanks for joining us. I don't know how we got to this loop
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:03.500]   Your fault. It's my fault. We appreciate it. We'll be back next week
[02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:06.540]   and that's
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:12.540]   World's longest change log
[02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:15.040]   (upbeat music)
