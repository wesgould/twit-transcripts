[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.560]   We'll talk about that in a moment. Oh hello. Hello. Hello. Come on. And new mama.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.680]   Yeah. Can you still say new mama? I guess you can. Yeah, two and a half months.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.480]   So I was in the first three new set on in.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   Set on in. Set on in. It is first Christmas. Oh yeah.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.080]   Spoiler.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.480]   Comes next. Oh yeah. Wow. Look at that.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.360]   He's a college. It's graduation today here at Tomorrow at CUNY. So I have my robe and my hat
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.200]   and my little. That's Nate. And is it Tassle? Now do you wear the robes of your own university
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   or do you wear the CUNY? Yes. Yes. Even though I only have a bachelor's degree. Yes. I wear
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.960]   a dress. You have to wear it. So there's different colors. So all the professors come out. I know
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.320]   this to my dad was a professor. Come out and they're different. He went to Columbia. So he has that.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.360]   I think it was royal blue with black. I have purple and and orange. Yeah, that's cool. I like that.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.240]   But wait a minute. It's December. You have graduation in June. We're a year and a half program.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:10.320]   We have Ira Glass as our. That's good. Very cool. And I will put up the links to the video when
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.480]   it's up. As they say in Aaron's, sort of movies about journalism. Good get. Yeah.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.840]   I'll take this off. I get all my journalistic terms from Aaron's sort of
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.760]   thing. I'll show you how much I know. That's cool. That looks good on you though.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.240]   Ah, that's a good look. When is the when is graduation? Do we have to rush here?
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.040]   No, no, it's tomorrow. Oh, it's tomorrow. And how many students is this from your program,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.640]   the journalism program? A program with hundreds of students. 100. Wow. That's awesome.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.760]   Also here from Google itself, Matt cuts one of the earliest Google employees.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.880]   Too long gone. We have a back. Hey, good to be back on the show. Thanks for having me.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.640]   And he fights spam on the Google web search results and does not speak for Google unless
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.360]   you ask about spam. Thanks for that. Advantestest claimer in case I say anything really stupid
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.320]   to get in trouble. But he's such a trusted long time employee there that he's actually allowed
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.360]   to do this show, which says something. Yeah, it's a ton of fun to be on. We love having you.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.000]   And we're going to put off the changelog a little bit because we have another guest to talk a little
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.600]   bit about YouTube. Lamar Wilson is also here. Hey, Lamar. Welcome. I'll do my crazy like,
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.440]   high like this because Jeff loves that.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.600]   That's all together. Hey, hey, come on.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:42.000]   The left side of the aisle is not going for that. One not one bit. Not at all. Lamar is a well-known
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.080]   YouTuber. Lamar Wilson is the channel. Comical videos about my everyday life. That's a new.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.440]   This is new. This is a new name and I rebooted the channel a little bit just to make it more
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.480]   personable. I still talk about gadgets and tech stuff. And I try to integrate it to a more personal
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.080]   story. And the audience is responding well. It's awesome. 19 and a half million video views.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.880]   Somebody's watching. Hey, and as we look at this, you could see the new look at YouTube.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:20.240]   Yeah, it is a new look. We're going to talk about that. Is this the new look? This is the
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.320]   this is the channel. The channels haven't changed. It's the other. It's the front page.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.920]   It's the front page or front page. Let me let me go to my front. Welcome, it says to the YouTube
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.400]   homepage. I love the kind of got it. All right. All right. I read that. Oh my God. Let me close the ad.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:43.040]   Which is half the page and then click got it. And here we go. Here we go. It's got a what to watch
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:53.360]   section recommended for you because you watched Lai Stung Geschrecht. In fact, quite a bit. Here's
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.480]   another one recommended because you watched Lai Stung Gesch. This is scams, sasquatch, and
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.280]   supernatural full lecture. Why don't what the connections are the database between between
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.840]   these things and Lai Stung Geschrecht. Because I watched pig heads, I get the zombie slayer.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.440]   Because I watched how Nexus Q works, I get a Google I/O keynote. What's interesting is I'm getting a
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.240]   lot of my own shows, which is, I guess, good. Which probably shows that you haven't watched
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.800]   your own shows, Leo. Oh, really? You watched them. Uh-huh. I haven't. Yes. Because I watched Lai Stung
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.520]   Geschrecht. It should watch the final episode of the Totally Rad Show, which is full of reggae.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.560]   Yeah. Look, I do not watch my own shows, but I'm pleased as a as a podcaster that YouTube is,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.800]   in fact, putting my shows there. Now, is that why? How does this work? Tell me all, Omar.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:50.240]   Okay. So last Thursday, YouTube, you know, completely redesigned the site. They gave us a warning
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.880]   here in L.A. We went to the YouTube space, L.A. The brand new site, and we kind of got a tour of it
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.680]   on Monday. And, you know, overall, it looks great. What YouTube is, and just a low history, also went
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.400]   to Google, come weeks ago to see Vikkundatra and another YouTube guy named Shashir to talk about,
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.360]   it's kind of this YouTube and Google+ specification that they're doing. So I kind of got an inside
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.840]   track before this was happening. But what YouTube is trying to do is what they first did is they
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.600]   had 12 pages on YouTube of different content. And so they decided to get rid of the pages
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.720]   to just three, your channel page, the video page, and what's the other page, the home page.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.560]   Now, I have to say that what we just saw was if you were not logged into YouTube, what you get
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.640]   as you just go there. And I think the issue with YouTube is discovery. Is it not? They want to,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.720]   and it's not merely discovery. They want you to watch shows, well, correct me if I'm wrong
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.960]   a little more, but I would guess that Google and YouTube are using this as a way to promote shows
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.120]   that promote their agenda, which is to make YouTube be more of an like, almost like a TV network,
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.240]   like an established purveyor of quality programming, as opposed to groin kick videos.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.480]   Right now, if you go back to the main, go back to the main page, because there was a bar in the
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.920]   right that I wanted to address. So go to my page, because this is if after you log in this one,
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.880]   because I've got what to watch my subscription social right there is fine because I wanted to
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.560]   address the right side to answer your question. If you look at the right side. Oh, yeah, this is
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.560]   where you want to be recommended channels. Yeah, now before it used to be recommended videos,
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.920]   the 100% focus right now for YouTube is subscribing. And here's the reason, Leo.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.400]   There are four to eight million approximate partners, partners are people who make money like
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.320]   myself, you know, we can add to the site. However, there are 800 million people who watch many of
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.720]   whom do not even have accounts who log in and don't even know what subscribe is. So they've
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.880]   trying they trying to increase the watch time. So of course, they're going to have people they want
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.320]   us to get our audience to log in to subscribe to be part of the site. Obviously, you know, they
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.280]   want that data, of course, so they can give better discovery. You know, I think it's I think the
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.160]   watch time on YouTube, Matt, correct me if I'm wrong, I think it's 10 minutes now, and they want
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.480]   it to increase it to about 30. They really want to triple, you know, the usage of someone who's
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.840]   just going to YouTube casually to stay there and watch. And then we get rewarded as partners
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.440]   the longer they stay and search results and so. So that's the kind of the reason of this big
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.520]   redesign is really about subscribing and about giving attention to channels.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.840]   How do you get to be on this recommended channels? It's algorithm algorithm. Yeah,
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.040]   because I'm looking filled to Franco. That makes sense. Two million subscribers.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:52.080]   Windows 99,000 Vsauce three. I don't know what that is 300,000. It's a science channel. It's
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.840]   actually really good. It's it sounds like this is kind of based on what I'm subscribing to,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:02.240]   although I see the Ellen DeGeneres show, which is not in any way motivated by anything I've ever
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.480]   watched. I don't think I got every I got Ellen recommended and I was like, Oh my God, they know
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.880]   about me. Well, they know I'm a lesbian too. And no, I just have a thing for Anne Hesh. Does that
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.120]   count? Actually, you know why I'm getting this? Because I did because we did watch a bunch of
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.120]   Ellen DeGeneres videos. I think maybe they saw that. So this, but I've never watched Vsauce,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.760]   but maybe they noticed I watched a lot of science. Absolutely. So that's the discovery they're
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.320]   trying to do for the channels. And you know, there may be some lucky people who get to get
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.680]   pinned there regularly to boost up their numbers because they have popular shows.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   One of the things you notice on the left side since you're logged in, I'll leave you back to that
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:46.800]   is there's a that bar on the left side is persistent. So you at the bottom, see your subscriptions,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.200]   which you can never really see before. So now you get to see channels and you get to see what
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.440]   activity that you haven't seen from them. I'm so glad to know I'm part of the kin community.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.080]   I guess. Yeah. Yeah, I must have subscribed to that at some point. I don't even so.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.840]   Why don't you click a video so that I can show you the. So as I'm, oh, I know what this is. This is
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.320]   a good friend of mine. Stacey Barcelotta used to be on
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:17.840]   Tech TV on call for help has a kin. She's part of the kin community. So now I'm watching Beth's
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:25.040]   Christmas morning breakfast. So now the left side you see the guy. So go ahead and click the guy to
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.680]   have that drop down. Okay, here's my guys. So it's initially collapsed, which is good. So it's kind
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.040]   of out of the way. Although that bar is there. You might as well just, I mean, I don't know what
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:39.600]   I gained by having a collapse. Like there. Yeah. Never get lost. Browse videos from the previous
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.760]   page, including the hump got it. So I'm going to close that. Your subscriptions are on the left
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.680]   side. So now if you're watching a video, you don't have to leave the video to go back to the home
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:55.440]   page to see. Oh, can I watch? They have it right there on the left side. I've done is they moved
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.920]   the subscribe button and the title below the video so that you can, you know, they're trying to
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.280]   encourage subscriptions and they want your eyes to be lower to, you know, to like the video to share
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.320]   it and things like that. But they also probably, I would guess, want to do is hide the comment area.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.760]   That's the first thing I do is hide that well below the fold. They don't want to make that very
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.680]   let's not look at that, folks. I don't know if that was intentional, but what do you see, Gina,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:31.440]   on your recommended channels besides Alan? I got nervous. Good choice. Rihanna, the New York Times,
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.720]   HBO. I've actually just subscribed to like, well, just in the time we've been talking,
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.680]   I've subscribed to like 15 different channels. So it works. Annoying Orange. It does work.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.880]   Oh, wait a minute. Why did they recommend annoying Orange to you?
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.520]   I'm sure that I watched. You must have watched some. I watched a annoying Orange in the past.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.200]   I got, I got, I got, I was already subscribed to Twitch. So I got a lot of suggestions to watch
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.240]   Twitch shows, which is totally spot on. It kind of turns into an RSS reader a little bit.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.080]   It's interesting. Yeah, I once watched an H. All right, subscribe to H Plus that show and
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.520]   I got annoyed at it in episode two, episode 41 of it now in recommendations. I got a record.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.400]   I know it's filled. The Franco got replaced on my page by Aura TV. Oh, look, you should,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.440]   you should be watching Al Jazeera. You must be a terrorist, Chad.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:26.000]   Look at that Al Jazeera is right up there. Also, there's, that's Z Frank.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.440]   Now Chris Perala is a featured. So that's actually,
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.040]   Oh, that's a played. That's not. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.560]   I got ABC News, Michael Jackson. I just recently watched Bijin.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.040]   I got Google Nexus as a channel, just the Google Nexus commercials.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.360]   But it does sound like they're paying attention to what you watch, not just on YouTube, but it
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   sounds like they might be paying attention to what you search for. Yeah, they do. And I will be
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.160]   remiss if I didn't talk about some of the problems. I think if I left her without addressing those,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.800]   my audience will kill me. So the, the main page, if you look in the center, you know, if you don't,
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:09.040]   you know, know what's going on, you know, you now see a page of likes, recommendations,
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.800]   comments, if you were subscribed to people, might say, Twitter uploaded, Twitter added,
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.840]   to a playlist. And that's good for discovery of the 800 million people because I think the
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.560]   average subscriptions are only like three. So the average person only subscribes to like three
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:30.560]   people. However, we have power users like myself who are furious at this because it takes three
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:37.280]   steps for the user, our subscribers to go to uploads only where they can see our content.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.840]   And so what's happened since Thursday, all of our views have dropped about half.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:49.120]   I see it as temporary because I kind of have an open mind. I see what they're doing. But
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.280]   because people are now lost because they have all these recommendations, they can't see my video
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.400]   that I uploaded about an hour or 40 minutes ago, because they see all this other content of people
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.440]   who like videos, people who comment it. So I talk to YouTube, they said what they're going to do
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   is make it sticky where a power user can buy default, just have it go to uploads on. Because
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.200]   I'm beyond this, if I'm subscribed to you, Leo, I love you, but I don't really care what you like
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.920]   or what you what you comment on and things like that. I want to just see my uploads
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   and see and that's one of the biggest problems right now that we're dealing with in this last week.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.000]   Interesting. So it's bad for us content creators and power users. But like I said,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.200]   they said they're going to fix it. It might be more egalitarian though, right? Could that be
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.360]   part of the reason? I mean, well, what they didn't want to make it by default uploads only,
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.440]   even though we would love that as creators because for us, they want discovery. They don't want you
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.200]   to go the same old ruts, right? Yeah, the problem is most people, we look at it from kind of a
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.880]   selfish point of view as creators, but most people who use YouTube don't subscribe to people. They
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:03.120]   just want to go there. They don't want to see a playlist. They want to see videos. So I understand
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.080]   what YouTube is doing. It doesn't mean I have to like it. Right. You know, so I hope they they
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.040]   definitely fix that. I think the, you know, the main thing, you know, they're trying to slowly
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.400]   integrate Google+, and we talked about this a couple weeks ago with when you were in here,
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.400]   about them trying to kind of Google find YouTube. I just, I told them when I went to go visit,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.640]   that I wish they would find a better way to educate power users about what they're going to do ahead
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.080]   of time. There was a good start that we had to look private meeting before. I think they just
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.200]   need to do more. I advocated for some kind of, you know, some kind of advocate for, you know,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.000]   YouTube or Google+, someone to speak on behalf. That's a creator. I think Phil DeFranco did a
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.800]   really good video ahead of time. We need more of those people to explain, hey, I know this
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.920]   looks confusing to your users. Here's how you fix it. And maybe it'll make for a better experience.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.080]   Yeah, I think over time people will figure that part out. There's also a social button,
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.520]   which is interesting. Google+, of course, is already connected, but they do have, you can connect
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:07.040]   Facebook to it. Oh, sorry. Something didn't work like it was supposed to try again. Well,
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:14.160]   you can connect Twitter to it. So that way you, let's authorize Twitter. And that way, oh, sorry,
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.080]   something didn't work. So try again, I guess you in theory, because there's buttons,
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:24.080]   you could connect those if it just worked. What do you follow? And they share videos?
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.920]   Right. Unfortunately, right now, it won't let me connect Facebook or Twitter, but Google+ works.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:37.120]   No problem. Yeah, you know, I want to say overall, like this, we got to see in LA,
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.720]   the channel changes. Now, if people are going crazy about this change, the channel changes are
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.440]   going to be unbelievable. We couldn't take pictures of it. We couldn't really give details, but they're
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:53.280]   going to do that in the first quarter of next year. And again, they're trying to make it all about
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:59.040]   discovery. And so us as creators, we're forced to, we don't have a choice, we kind of have to put
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.800]   ourselves out of the equation and see the bigger picture that YouTube is focused on getting all
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:12.960]   these 800 million people in to be part of it instead of just casual viewers. Right. So I like,
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.440]   I like what they're doing. I hope my views being cut and have is not permanent.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.600]   Jeez. I'll be living with you.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.840]   We have a place you could just bed down in the basement here. It's very comfortable.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.040]   All the, all the YouTube creators will be there soon.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.680]   So yeah, you're right. Featured has been rotating and that's filled to Franco. It's,
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.440]   it's these are Al Jazeera. These are paid. I have the Wall Street Journal now. So that's probably,
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.080]   I don't know if features is paid or it's something that YouTube's doing. And then I get it, I'm getting
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.000]   the same recommendations here over and over again, the lows of featured.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.640]   Search in the search box at the top. Yeah. Just for random topic, you'll see the ability to
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:04.080]   subscribe even from there. And that's new. So I'm gonna search for Epic Meal Time. And okay. And now,
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:10.640]   yes, I did mean Epic Meal Time. So let's see, by the way, I get craft cooking school videos
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.520]   above that as an ad, which is good. Oh, yes. Channel or subscribe. So I can just say subscribe
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.640]   right there. And now I'm subscribed. I had a KitchenAid ad. Yeah.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.120]   See, it left, it highlighted it and showed you on the left that you subscribed. That's a
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.560]   no thing because a lot of people will click subscribe and not know what that means.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:35.200]   Plus, they never watched the videos. So how they see, oh, on the left, that's where I can see all
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.160]   the subscriptions. So they're trying to train the masses on what subscribe is. And I think it's
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.880]   gonna be a slow process. And I don't know what they're gonna do, frankly, when Google+, and, and
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.440]   YouTube merges, are they gonna go to follow as a word? Circle.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.360]   You're debating it right now. Yeah. So that's an interesting point. Do you notice as a YouTube
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.760]   creator that there is a correlation between number of subscriptions and number of video views?
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.360]   Do you know the words? Do you want to really promote subscribers? Because, you know, as far as
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.160]   I can tell, subscribing to something doesn't doesn't really jet doesn't send it to you. It's
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.640]   like not like an RSS is more like an RSS feed than it is a podcast, for instance.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.880]   But it's gonna show up in your in your list of right now will show up here on the left. Yeah,
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:22.880]   Chad, you do YouTube videos. So and I'm sure Lamar will say this, but but in in the past, it was
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.160]   a normal YouTube user would subscribe, check YouTube in the morning, and then watch the videos
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.520]   that came in from the subscription. So it was a direct correlation. But now when it's more algorithmic,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.800]   maybe not. Yeah, it still is to a point. And the good part is that the as a user,
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.080]   I have an option to go into my subscriptions and check, get email uploads so they can they
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.600]   will get an email whenever I upload a video. Right. And I have to say, if I go on the left here,
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:55.120]   you know, the default is what to watch, but I can also click my subs then that's the one that's
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:00.000]   algorithmic, but then I can click my subscriptions. And this will be all activity. And here,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.720]   Lamar, I can see uploads only so I can see new uploads, right? That's also a problem,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.640]   because how many steps did I take you? Yeah,
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.920]   two steps to get to what you wanted to see. And you know what they should do? Just let it stay
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.600]   there. That's my indication that that's where I wanted to be. It should always load to the last
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.440]   place I went. Well, that that's the problem, because if they make it default, most people are only
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.200]   subscribed to a few people. So they'll come to a point where there are no videos there.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:34.640]   So what they're going to do is make it sticky for people like you and me who are power users who
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.840]   want that feature to keep it sticky. So that they're definitely going to do it. I wish they
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.760]   would have done it at the rollout, because that would have made it life a lot easier for us.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:50.800]   Lamar Wilson's channel is Lamar Wilson with two R's L-A-M-A-R-R Wilson on YouTube.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.600]   And Lamar, it's great to see you come up and visit us. Thank you for having me. Yeah,
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.800]   the tyranny of the default is what they call that, isn't it? Cyber. See you Lamar. See you Lamar. Bye-bye.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.040]   Thank you. Good to see you Lamar. Let's take a break. We'll come back. Change log.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:12.080]   More Google news than you can stuff a pig with. And it's the end of the year. So Twitter,
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:18.160]   YouTube and Google, Google started this years ago with Zeitgeist. Now everybody's doing it.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.840]   So YouTube, Twitter, I mean, Google, Twitter and Facebook now all have year-ender videos.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:33.280]   We'll have it the battle of the year-ender videos also when we come back. First a word from Stamps.com.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.400]   I don't want you to go to the post office anymore. I don't, especially if you're pro. If you're a
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:44.320]   serious person, does a lot of fulfillment, a lot of mailing, your business, you send out invoices
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:51.440]   or marketing material. If you're a seller on eBay or Amazon and you're just mailing a lot of stuff,
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.120]   last thing you want to do in December is go to the post office because that's the month of the
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:02.560]   amateurs. That's when the amateur, you don't want to be mixed in. You're a pro. Proseusestamps.com.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.520]   It's the ultimate way to do mailing because it means you can do everything you need to do
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:14.080]   from your desk. You can print, buy and print postage, US postage from your computer, your printer.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.000]   You don't need a meter. You don't need a meter. You don't pay extra for Enki. Just use your printer,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.640]   your computer. The mail care comes and picks up packages. You can do it, of course, during
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.920]   their daily run, but you can also call and schedule free pickups. You have a USB scale, so you're
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.800]   always paying exactly the right amount. No postage due. No overpaying. That's what I always do.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.920]   Put too many stamps on a package because you want to make sure it gets never again.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.840]   With that scale, you just plop the package on the scale. It automatically prints exactly the
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.600]   right amount. By the way, not just stamps, it prints the mailing label. It gets the address
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.640]   information from your address book. If you use QuickBooks, from QuickBooks, from Amazon, eBay,
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.680]   PayPal, Etsy, it just pulls that out of there. It fills the whole thing in. If you're doing
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.240]   international mailing, it even fills out the international mailing forms. Plus, the post office
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.600]   loves stamps.com so much that they actually give you discounts you cannot get at the post office.

[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.840]   Google. You want to see that? I'm not going to play the whole thing. The zeitgeist year in
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.160]   reviews, two minutes, 45 seconds in April. It's a little obvious. Yeah, but let's just say,
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   here's to 2012. It says, here's to the curious. And it shows Felix Baum-Gonner.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:09.200]   I pom sweat again. Jumping out of that capsule, 120,000 feet of... It shows...
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.720]   This is the Olympic runner, right? Right. What's his name? Yeah, what's his name? It shows the
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:21.040]   debate between what's his names. It shows Sai. Here he is. Up on Gangnam Style. I guess he was really
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:29.920]   the video of the... There's the SpaceX launch. That's cool. We searched for firsts. The first
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:37.680]   takes Bozon, the first person cured of HIV. China to launch a manned space mission. Hurricane Sandy.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   It's kind of... I like these zeitgeist because it also reminds you what happened early in the year,
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:50.640]   not just recently, right? Yeah, and if you go to the... There's a zeitgeist site that has the
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.760]   tops and all these categories. That's what I really like. Stop SOPA.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.520]   Here's the Egyptian spring. Where's that Syria?
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.800]   Might be Syria. I think it'd be Syria, because I don't know. Well, it's just stuff going on in
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:10.720]   Egypt, too. So this is a nice video. I like it. And yeah, so it's at google.com/psychic.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.080]   I think it's all... The link should be on there. Oh, yeah, of course. That's why we just
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:20.320]   clink Google the link at go to google.com/psychicic. How many... When did you start doing this, Matt?
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.960]   Do you remember? It's been a long time. It's been several years. Yeah. And there's always a hot
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:31.200]   debate about whether you show the most popular searches, which are like free or Facebook or whatever.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.600]   Boring. Whether you show the first derivative and then you get into the trending stuff and
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.760]   the stuff that's hot topics. So that's why it doesn't say the most common search, because you're
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:46.720]   right. It's stupid. You get trending. Hotmail. Pre-sex. Yeah. Yeah. So for instance, in trending
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.640]   searches in entertainment, you got Whitney Houston number one. Gangnam Style number two,
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.840]   hurricanes. Actually, this is an entertainment. This is searches. Okay.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.280]   iPad 3. Do you get involved with this matter? Is this something... How is this done?
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.960]   It's kind of interesting. There are some engineers who built a lot of the code to figure out what
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:10.000]   are the trending topics. But then after that, it goes to a great team of people who sort of look
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.080]   through it and pick out what categories of searches are especially interesting. And it's a lot of
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.360]   fun because you really do feel like you're looking into what the world is thinking about.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.040]   I've always loved cyclists. Do you know Matt? Do they resolve misspellings?
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.320]   Presumably there's been any styles of gang and pop people guess.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:33.280]   Yeah. That's always a hot debate. Do you give the exact raw answer or do you basically say,
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.680]   well, okay, you're looking at the aggregated stuff. Oh, this was a bot, you know, and you take that
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.960]   out or something like that. Yeah. In fact, I've noticed over the years it's gotten more and more
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   curated. This is much more editorial than it was in the early days when it really was kind of,
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.640]   you know, because everybody Yahoo and Altiv is that they all did it. And it free. You're right.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.400]   Free naked sex. All of that.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:59.040]   For trending images, one direction, Selena and iPhone five for athletes, Jeremy Lynn,
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:05.600]   Michael Phelps and Peyton Manning for events, Sandy, Kate Middleton, Olympics for people.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.160]   Like, it's interesting that it's iPad, but then Samsung. Oh, yeah. And iPad.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.400]   Now the big, the big thing, and I hope I'm not stealing your numbers, is that your number?
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.760]   No, I do better. I knew I knew that's the story.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:29.360]   1.2 trillion searches. How much bigger is that than previous years, Matt?
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:35.760]   You know, it grows quite a bit every year. And then lately we've seen mobile and mobile is growing
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.600]   at a phenomenal rate, like at the early days of Google. And so you can see in maybe not next year,
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.280]   but in a year or two after that, we might cross over and have more searches from mobile. So that's
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   been a big driver of a lot of these searches. I would love to know the different one thing.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.080]   For next year, Matt, when you I would love to know if you separated out mobile searches from
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.440]   web searches, what that looks like. Yeah, you definitely see a lot more like local
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.080]   sort of stuff when you do the local searches, you know, and so there is a distinct difference
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.240]   between those types of queries. It's also fun because you can go by country. You can see what the
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:17.280]   top searches in those categories are in all these different countries. And of course, Norway,
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:23.200]   the top searches are very different. Netflix is number one because they got Netflix. So that's cool.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:33.680]   But this is this is really fun. But now everybody's doing it. So Facebook has their 2012
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:40.960]   and a special kind of a timeline. And so does so does Twitter effect. I think it was our friend
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:47.920]   Karen Wicker who wickery who did the post on that. Let's see if I can do the Facebook one.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.880]   I can't remember what was it Facebook.com. There's there's Karen's blog post and they made a video
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.120]   too. And actually they might have had the most iconic image of the year, which is President
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.720]   Obama hugging his wife. And that was just rolled out of that page to Leo. You also see that they
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   have things like the most retweeted tweets. Yeah, actually scroll down a little bit. Yeah.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:15.760]   It's like the link there. So you see golden tweets go do the golden tweets because the number one
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:22.160]   tweet of the year is four more years on the at Barack Obama account with that picture, which became
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:31.440]   you know famous. Justin Bieber number two, RIP Avilana who was a young fan of his who passed away.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.680]   Um, we will skip over that one.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:44.560]   No, I knew I've actually looked at this. There was an NFL profane NFL tweet that actually was
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:50.240]   great. He was said, I'll give find me NFL and I'll give them and pay and pay the referee so they
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:57.920]   can come back, which I kind of liked. That was TJ, right? It's kind of fun to look at these. And
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.720]   I think this is a smart marketing tool for all three of these companies. Facebook did something a
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:09.920]   little different though. Facebook, um, made a timeline out of your stuff, which I think is kind
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:15.440]   of interesting. Well, Twitter did something similar. They did a partnership with Visify and you could
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.720]   do your year on Twitter. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's like the tab all the way to the right at
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.880]   that golden tweet site. Do you want to do your chat or should I do mine? Let me do mine because
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.480]   we don't know. I've already done mine. We don't know what Chad's been tweeting. Yeah, right.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.720]   It shows, uh, you have to import in and have you done yours yet? Oh, you have to import it in. Well,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.720]   you better show yours because I haven't so so I did the whole thing. Oh, that's cute. So you get
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:45.520]   all sorts of stuff. I'll show like, uh, this is a Christmas holiday thing and this is like a
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.080]   nat, you know, what your your good tweet. These are words that I've to look at that. You have a
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.560]   whole bunch of pages. So like, so what's the number one word that you've tweeted? Can you tell or show?
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:01.920]   Show shows huge. But it's divided into a timeline. So it's over the months. Yeah. You can also see,
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:08.480]   I had an automated if this, the net thing, which posted new episodes of my podcast and so you can
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:15.600]   see these, these trends right here. But, but what Gina's talking about is year on Twitter,
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.120]   which is the last one. And so you can see my golden tweet, which was right after the SpaceX
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.520]   launch. What makes it golden? Is it the most retweeted? The most retweeted. And this was retweeted
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:33.200]   20 times. And then my golden follower is actually the fellow who made the posters. Oh, Matt, Martin,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.720]   Martin, Martin Anderson. And he's mentioned me 60 times this year. Thank you, Martin. Right.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:44.080]   And then it sort of does that sort of words thing that was was before. But, um, so where do I find
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.480]   that? I want to do that. Just head on over to Visify and then you can you can log in with
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   LinkedIn. You can log in. Oh, it is. If you go to 2012. Twitter.com,
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.400]   perfect. It'll it'll give you golden tweets, pulse of the planet only on Twitter, trends,
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:05.440]   new voices, and then your year on Twitter. And so that's neat. Visify is a third party, right?
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:11.520]   Right. Right. And so it does a lot of things. So like here's, here's a four square check-ins on
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:17.120]   on places that I've eaten. Dinner is my most recent check-in. I go to you could have done this, Gina.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:23.280]   Yeah. Yep. Yep. This is beautiful. Yeah. That's right. What's funny is that, you know,
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.680]   the Twitter API only goes back 3000 tweets. So a Neil, my partner did this and he like,
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:33.120]   it went back to November. Oh, he's a heavy tweeter. Yeah. He's a heavy tweeter. For me,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:40.880]   I'm only 2000. So it got everything. Okay. So it's just imported my, uh, my tweets.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.840]   My golden tweet. Oh, was, uh, was, uh, while we're watching the Mars landing, the first person
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.320]   will walk in Mars is probably a high school student watching this right now. So the curiosity landing
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:58.400]   retweeted 986 times. And the Tri-caster is my golden follower. Thank you, Tri-caster. I say
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.800]   show a lot too, apparently. This is cool. Um, I don't know how many tweets does, where do you
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:12.080]   find out how many tweets it's, uh, synthesized here? Um, good question. I don't know if it, it's
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.760]   not really for, you know, settings and really diving into analyze. Right. It's more of a visual
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.800]   representation. So it may not give you, uh, so if I click, get more in for graphics, oh, no,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.840]   that makes me a Visify customer. Right. Right. So that's, that's their little plug.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.920]   And mine, mine says, uh, oh, tweetaholic Twitter. Let's analyze your last 30,
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.240]   30, 200 tweets. So we can only go back to January 2012. So I guess, I guess it took me back to
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:41.280]   January, but not quite all the way. My golden tweet was a tweet about a certain domain registrar.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.800]   Uh, I tweeted about that as well. Yeah.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.480]   Yeah. It was supported so and kills elephants. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.360]   It objectifies women. So that, that, that, that tweet went far apparently. Not fine with him either.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:59.360]   Yeah. So Mike, my golden tweet says, every night millions of players sit down to play the
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.880]   addictive, massively multi online player game called email.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.840]   This is a good, this is a measure of your wittiness.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.120]   What is yours, Jeff might as well, this is V I Z I F Y right?
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.200]   No, just go to a 2012 dot Twitter.com. Oh, okay.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.840]   2012 dot Twitter.com. And then the last one is your tweets. It does take a little while to import
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.400]   all of that. And then while we're doing that, let me see if I can find what is it? Facebook.com.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:35.040]   Maybe it's slash 2012. Uh, no, that's, that's some guy got that. Jason Rubenstein. Well done.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.480]   He knew that that someday it would be valuable to have that nickname.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:52.000]   The spimmers are instantly grabbing 2013. Yeah. Brilliant. I believe it's facebook.com/my-year-in-status.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.040]   You can look forward. That's easy to remember. Yeah. Super easy. Thanks, Facebook. Uh, just, um,
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.400]   you're on Facebook. You don't need the hyphen list. No, this isn't it either. No, not it.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:06.880]   No, no, no, no, no. I, I, I bookmarked it. Let me just check my pinboard because I was so
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:14.720]   excited. Maybe my golden is this debate needs a half time and an angry coach in the locker room.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:20.720]   That was the first debate probably you were saying somebody needs a spank president Obama,
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:26.800]   I think. Yeah. I don't know how many it got for me because it doesn't go back very far. I'll bet.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.080]   Yeah. Considering that I'm allowed mouth.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:39.280]   Okay, so here it is. No.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:49.760]   The Facebook blog doesn't have anything on it. I'm just googling. Oh, here it is. Facebook.com/year-in-review.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:56.640]   Year in review. And so you get the year in review and you can see the trans memes,
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.680]   events, most listened to songs, movies. They got a lot of signals. They got a lot of signals.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.000]   This would be very interesting. I mean, still not maybe as many as Google, but this would be
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.360]   very interesting. What do you want? You want memes? What's the, what are the big memes in the US?
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.240]   Number one, to be honest, TBH.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:24.880]   Lincanity, big bird, SMH, shaking my head. So these are just like phrases, I guess.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.560]   Huh. All right. I'll show you my, so then you click this to see your 2012 year in review. And
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.120]   I don't know how it's doing this, but I have a feeling this will do well. So instead of the
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.520]   year in review for everybody, who cares about that? We're a narcissistic generation. We want to know,
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:45.680]   we want to know what's number one with us. And so what they do is they take your timeline
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.400]   and they, and you go back and through great moments in your, in your, in your year.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.800]   Yeah. I mean, mine is just, it's basically just a hlog of pictures of my daughter.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:00.560]   Yeah. Like, yeah, that was good. As it should be. Yeah. As it should be. There's a Christmas card.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:06.880]   There's me and my new boyfriend. There's Sarah Lane, my ex-girlfriend. Here we are in Norway.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:12.640]   Yeah, it's cool. That's cool. I think that this is kind of, this is spring. Isn't that your timeline
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.600]   already? Anyway, it's just, it's just, it's just, it seems like it's presented. I guess, I guess they,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:23.520]   they surface the stuff they got the most responses. I, yeah, probably the most thumbs up or something.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.120]   Yeah. So it's kind of cool. I mean, it goes back in chronological order.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:31.440]   Yeah. Yeah. Mine is heavily my daughter and that was only like the last couple of months,
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.040]   but I just got a lot of likes and stuff from a family. So that makes sense. Well, here's the,
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.960]   here's the first thing I posted in 2012. I had just gotten the car, uh, repaired. It was back.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:47.280]   It was all, all clean and nicely done. Oh geez. Oh my goodness.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   Anyway, I get some use out of that someday. It's cool. I think it's fun that Twitter,
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.000]   Facebook and following in Google's footsteps, I think Google did it first.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:07.280]   And just, I'm just saying that because you're here, Matt. I appreciate that. I noticed that in
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:13.680]   December, you know, a lot of the stories in the regular newspaper are like, yes, here's the top
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.280]   brand trends or whatever. And it's like, yeah, everybody's going on vacation early. Yeah.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.960]   No, we're going to do that. We do our best ofs. In fact, this would be a good time to send
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:27.280]   you to twit.tv/bestof. And we're so lazy. We ask you to tell us what the best moments were.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.760]   We don't know. So go there and nominate your, we're going to do one for Twig, right? That's
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.080]   correct. Yeah. Nominate your best moments for Twig. What I always did was the year,
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:41.120]   year behind and the year ahead. So like we do one day Christmas week, you do the year,
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:47.920]   you know, 2012 year in review. And then the next week you do looking ahead to 2013.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.040]   Because what else you're going to do? There's no news. Yeah. Nothing to talk about.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.320]   I think I'm going to channel Devorok right now. I hate those lists. I know.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.400]   Well, everybody does. I'm sure the newspapers do. But what are you going to do? There's no news.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:04.240]   The predictions are fun. I do like reading what people predict about Apple's going to,
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.760]   you know, beat Microsoft or all those sorts of things. That's a lot of fun.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.720]   That's what we should do.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.640]   Yeah. I also like best music of the year because I'm old and don't keep up with new music. So I
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.400]   rely upon other people's lists of like best music of the year and be like, Oh, I missed this.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.320]   Although all of them have called me maybe at the top. So I don't know. Yeah, right.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.280]   Looking at the wrong list. Right on. Great song.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:31.040]   I'm actually surprised that call me maybe is a number one on Facebook and we are young as first.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.280]   We are young. Yeah. And then somebody used to know and then call me maybe.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.960]   Is we are young that goes to. Yeah. Yeah. That one. Yeah. Yeah. And T B H, which is to be honest,
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   which I have T B H haven't heard of before this. Yeah. Beat out Yolo. What's up with that? Yolo is
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:57.360]   what is Yolo? Yolo live once. That's a thing. Yeah. It's so much of a thing. It has a backlash
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:04.160]   already. It does. You're kidding. No. Yeah. People who missed it all. It's like, okay,
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:12.400]   but you do only live once. So why like FOMO fear of missing out? But I didn't know about Yolo and
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:22.640]   Oh, no. So kind of Lee, I feel. So is that that means that that happened a lot in status updates?
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.960]   That has to be what it means. Yeah. That those words occurred the most status updates.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.480]   The biggest memes and apparently a dog with a with a collar on it. Yes. Big. All right.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:38.960]   Here's a challenge, Leo. Could we start a meme? So next year it gets on the biggest memes list.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:47.520]   Shouldn't be too hard. If T B H got number one. Yeah. Come on. I always liked POS. Oh, I see.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:53.520]   POS stands for parents over shoulder, by the way. No, what do you think? Yolo. L O L J K. I am a cat.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:00.800]   Because they live nine times, you know, right? Oh my God. These are all the Yolo's. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:09.360]   Holy Yolo. Yeah. What does this say, Chad? This is no your meme. All right. This is. Yes. No,
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:17.280]   your mean God for no, your meme. Yeah, seriously. I would know. So most listen to songs. You just
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:23.440]   said that. Okay. That's to it. We are young. Somebody that I used to know. I liked that. Call me
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.600]   maybe. What makes you beautiful by one direction? I never even heard of one direction until the.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.560]   You are way too old. Well, it was the ads. It was the Pepsi ad that
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:40.640]   pay phone by Maroon five. Kanye Westmer. And look at though, how big compared to the other ones
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:48.800]   we are young is got a big wedge. I love this stuff. Okay. You want to guess what movie?
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:53.600]   Or is movies? Oh, I were games. Hunger Games, right?
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:43:01.520]   Vendors was number two magic. Magic Mike. God, it was so bad. You know, I was shocked. It got on the
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:08.480]   New Yorker's top 10 movie lists of the year. What? What? For the apps? I mean, what? I think it was
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:19.520]   for the apps. I think it was. I don't want. I don't know if that's if it's
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.400]   Twilight or that is more depressing. What's more depressing?
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.840]   So on Netflix, I've just started rewatching my favorite movies. So, Idiocracy, you know,
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.720]   almost space. Good movie. You're a Mike Judge fan. Is yours just what the Mike Judge Film Festival?
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.240]   Yeah. Yeah. Instead of doing the new stuff, you're just like, well, why not just go back and
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:43.680]   watch the classic Princess Pride? That's good. All right. So there you go. The year is over.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:52.640]   And so is this year in review. Thank you very much. I want to talk about your op-ed about privacy,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.760]   Gina, in just a little bit. Okay. And also, Marissa Meyer starting to make her
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:04.960]   presence felt that Yahoo already some big upgrades. In fact, the biggest upgrade that
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.520]   everybody thought should be upgraded. It might be the one to talk about. Flicker.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.120]   And then we'll ask Matt Cutz where that $10 billion is. Now, he knows what I'm talking about.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:25.840]   It's in Bermuda. I don't know if I can get angry about that, frankly. I mean, if I had $10 billion
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:33.920]   to hide in a tax haven, I would hide it. I can join in on that conversation too, because the UK is
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:41.600]   just being, I think, ridiculous in demanding that you basically volunteer money when the problem is
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.280]   the law. Right. Please give us some money because just to be a nice person. But we will be back.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:52.560]   Google and Apple teaming up finally. It's about time. Yeah. Yeah. Peace in the kingdom.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:45:00.640]   Peace in the kingdom. Lying down together. But first, a word from Ford and the fabulous
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:06.720]   Ford autonomous vehicle program. Because that's what it's starting to look like.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.640]   Google may have actual autonomous vehicles with hundreds of thousands of miles on the road.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:16.080]   But look what Ford's doing. Sneaky these guys. In fact, I'm going to talk to Alan Malala,
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.680]   CEO Ford at CES again this year. And I'm going to put him on the spot and say,
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.520]   Alan, every year I say, are you working on autonomous vehicles? And every year Ford says,
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:32.160]   Alan says, Leo, people love to drive. But I'll tell you what I learned in my many years
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:38.160]   Boeing designing cockpits for planes like the triple seven, that it's, you need a pilot. You need
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:44.160]   a guy, you know, at the wheel or the yoke or the joystick. But you can have these systems,
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.960]   these autonomous systems help them be better. And that's exactly what Ford is doing with things
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:54.240]   like I've talked about the, what we talked about the adaptive cruise control, right? And we talked
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:46:00.000]   about the lane assist. Now what about bliss? This is something really cool. The blind spot
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:09.600]   information system BLIS. Watch this. Sensors in the vehicles rear quarter panels are scanning blind
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:16.640]   spots in traffic. If another vehicle is in your blind spot, you'll see audible and visual alerts.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.720]   So you know, you know, this thing where you can see them, but then they disappear for a while in
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:25.200]   the mirror. It also enables a feature called the cross traffic alert that warns you of
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.880]   oncoming traffic when you're backing out of a parking space. And I had that the other day,
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.200]   and it was so cool. I was got, I had two big, you need it nowadays with trucks and SUVs.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.880]   Everybody's got giant cars. And I'm driving the fusion. And I'm backing up and it says,
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.240]   there's somebody coming, you can't see them. It's kind of, it looks around the corner and knows
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:49.200]   when there's oncoming traffic, even when you can't see it can. Awesome. Just a great tool.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.440]   Now I've also used the active park assist. Now this did not work out so well for me,
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:59.040]   but it's not for its fault. It was my fault. So the idea, why is it so that you have the video
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.560]   check? Because it's really cool. So you're driving along and you want to park, you press a button.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.040]   I was in a Ford Flex. We did this on the test track. I think they kind of knew Leo was an idiot.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:12.400]   And you press a button and as you drive along and it measures the spaces as you drive by them.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:19.200]   And when you go by a space that's big enough, it says, Oh, I see a spot. Literally. And then
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.160]   space found. And it says, pull forward, you pull forward. You press the button to do the active
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:31.120]   park assist. Now here's the thing, keep your feet on the brake and the accelerator. Like it says to,
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:37.040]   I just lifted my hands and feet off the wheel. Now this does do everything, right? But the car is
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:42.960]   still in gear. So I just, I parked, I thought, wow, that's amazing. And then I kept my foot on the
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.760]   accelerator and backed in the car. Oh, oh, my man. There were a bunch of engineers in the car,
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:55.920]   I mean, laughing up really. It was so embarrassing. But it is amazing. The truth is,
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:01.680]   I was my mind was blown because what did you do hit a Chevrolet? Yeah, no, it was a fiesta or
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.200]   something. Something they handed on the test track. What they did, they said the whole thing. It was
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   so cool. It was amazing because you push the button and the wheel starts going, and you know how hard
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.040]   it is to parallel park. You're supposed to look and you would do the thing and that's all geometry.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:20.720]   It does it. It just, it just parks itself. It is the first experience I ever had of a car driving
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:27.760]   itself. And I think I was just so flabbergasted. I just, I was amazing. It's really, really cool.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:33.920]   Have you ridden in the Google autonomous car? You must have met. I have not, you know, I threw a
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:39.520]   twin stream. I've had two or three chances and each time I'm like, oh, I'm the last guy in the line.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.880]   You just get to ride or something. Rings. Oh, I'd love to do that. Well, next best thing, the 2013
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:51.680]   Ford Fusion and the 2013 Ford Tour, both of which have available bliss and active park assist.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:56.480]   You could find out more and look at the videos and all that stuff. Ford.com/technology. It is really,
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:04.080]   really neat stuff. And yeah, I'm happy to say that I will be interviewing Alan Malali and Paul
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:11.600]   Macarranis. Alan, of course, CEO of Ford. Paul is the CTO of Ford at CES this year. We'll get those,
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.000]   we'll get those interviews up on the, on the network too. So in fact, if you've got questions,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.960]   you'd like to ask, I'd love to hear them and I'll be on the Ford stage. I think that's the first
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:26.160]   day of CES, Tuesday. Thanks to the folks at Stitcher who are setting this all up for us.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:32.880]   And thanks to Ford for their support of this week in Google. So Gina, is this your first time
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:39.280]   writing for the New York Times? It is. It is. Cool. Yeah, thank you. So exciting.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:45.760]   This is in the room for debate section of the opinion pages. And it was about privacy. And so
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:50.640]   there were a bunch of people. There's Ed Felton from Princeton, somebody from Pinboard from the
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:57.040]   Cato Institute from the EFF of Vivian Redding. We've talked about before is on the,
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:03.680]   yeah, she's on the EC's, the European Commission and has been very, she's the one who has the,
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.280]   what's the right to be forgotten, right? Right to be forgotten. She has the four principles,
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:11.840]   four pillars of privacy that I've gone on about the show. So she would be the privacy hawk in
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:17.760]   there. So what did you say? Gina in there? Well, the question was about whether or not when we use
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.160]   apps, we should just, we should just face the fact that we're relinquishing our privacy, right?
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.360]   And the question was hooked on this new FTC study report that just got, just came out this week
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:33.280]   that basically showed that alarming percentages of apps, like 60% of apps that children use is
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:40.960]   actually a report about children's apps secretly transmit data about usage data without letting
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.280]   parents know without user consent. So things like telephone number, device ID,
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:51.840]   tracking information, you know, for apps or games, say, for example, that have advertising in them,
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:57.120]   you know, that that transmittent information about usage across various apps. So this FTC report
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:02.560]   comes out, it sounds like lots of apps in the Google Play Store and the iTunes Store are transmitting
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.440]   information without consent, questioning whether or not that this violates a COPPA,
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.760]   which is a children's online privacy protection act. And the times kind of rolled this up and said,
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:17.040]   well, children or adults, no matter what web or mobile, should we just face the fact that we just
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.480]   don't have, you know, you were relinquishing our privacy just by using technology, which of course
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:28.000]   is a totally loaded question and like terrible way to frame it. It's not a binary thing, right?
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   So I wrote a piece, it's just a sort of mini op-ed, but what I was saying, and I was trying to
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.320]   channel Jarvis here, especially in the second graph, but I was saying that, you know, that
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:41.840]   basically that sharing sharing information isn't necessarily relinquishing your privacy,
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.400]   that it's not a black white, right? And that sharing kinds of information, we share information
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.920]   when we use our credit card in a restaurant, we use an easy path at the toll booth, that was sort
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.880]   of a Northeast reference, and that we share information in order partake in this kind of speed and
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.760]   convenience to certain services, and that the problem isn't the sharing of information or the
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.840]   data transmission, the problem is the secretiveness. And this is an argument that I've made here on the
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:09.040]   show, a bunch of times is that apps should disclose what kind of information they're gathering,
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:13.680]   collecting, transmitting, why and why they need that information. So I talked about how
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   path earlier this year that a developer outed path for transmitting people's address books,
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.040]   the contents of their address book from their iPhone and storing it on their servers on their
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.680]   side without letting users know, and that, you know, they kind of, there was an uproar, people
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.920]   pointed out they were doing this, and it kind of came out that this was kind of a standard,
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:36.640]   you know, a thing that a lot of different iOS apps did, and in response to the uproar,
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:40.400]   path changed the behavior of the app and asked for permission with the ability to opt out,
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:47.360]   and Apple added an address book permissions prompt into iOS six. And I think that this is how we're
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.680]   evolving at the moment, right? Like we're still really early in the kind of smartphone plot,
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:56.080]   particularly with smartphones era, and I think we need to figure out, you know, what kind of
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:59.920]   behaviors are okay, what's the best user experience for these permissions? We've talked about on the
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:04.640]   show here, we don't want to recreate Windows Vista, you know, where every single thing that you do,
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.720]   you get a permissions prompt, but there's, there's a happy, there's a happy medium. So that was kind
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.880]   of the gist of my, of my take on it that, you know, I'm an app developer and I'm a mom and I'm
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:19.040]   concerned about privacy. But I also understand, you know, that that sharing information makes for
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:24.960]   better experiences. It's really, really well done, Gina. Yeah, I agree. I'm tough on privacy
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:30.160]   things, but I couldn't have said it better myself. And which I hope is a compliment. And, you know,
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:37.040]   the beauty of it was that, yes, you share the concerns, you, you endorse working in ways to preserve
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:44.160]   our privacy in those concerns, but you also just are playing out rational and say that this stuff
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.440]   has a good end to it. And I put out like Google's dashboard, which lists all your products with all
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:54.160]   the data that it stores and kind of like how we want to encourage that kind of transparency about
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.960]   what apps are storing, why they're storing it. And I use example, you know, and I don't know if this
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.880]   is still true Pandora, but there was a point of which I installed Pandora on my phone and it asked
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:08.160]   for access to my address book. And I was just like, I couldn't fathom it. Why would you need that? Yeah,
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.640]   meaning app need access to my address book. And it turns out that they just haven't of a share
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:18.000]   this playlist with your contacts function. But it didn't, but I didn't know that and I couldn't
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.840]   tell that and it made me suspicious. And I actually think that you should have a healthy skepticism
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.320]   about it. I think you should question why do you need access to this or that? And I think our
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:31.360]   permissions models could be a little better, you know, in the, in the, in the case of Pandora,
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:35.440]   for example, the app's not going to work if it can't access the internet connection. And that's
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.120]   obvious, right? The music streaming app needs internet connection, but apps should be able to
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:44.480]   work maybe without that easily share my playlist. I mean, users should be able to sort of selectively
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.800]   opt out of certain of certain of giving apps certain permissions. So I actually think, and I didn't
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.520]   say this in the piece, I think Androids a lot farther along with this. And it kind of always
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:58.320]   has been an iOS. Androids always had sort of a list of detailed permissions that every app needs.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:02.400]   If you look at any app in the play store, you can see that. And Google in general, I think,
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.960]   has been, and I'm not trying to kiss up because Matt's here.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:12.160]   I'll go the extra mile and actually give some kudos to Windows Phone 8 because they have,
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:17.040]   I think, a kids corner feature where you can say, okay, designate apps that are safe for your kid.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:21.360]   And then it's, I think I haven't used Windows Phone 8, but it's like locked down so you can give
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:26.240]   it to the child and know that they're only going to be using the apps that you said are okay. And
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.560]   that seems like another great way to, you know, you don't want a kid randomly pressing the buttons
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:34.720]   on your phone anyway. And so there's a lot of different ways you could try to think about
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:39.200]   putting the power in the hands of the parents and then trusting the parents to do what they think
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:44.800]   is best. Well, but the problem with some, well, like cop-a legislation is that what it says is that
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:50.560]   the parent, if an educational app wants to do geography and starting from the town where you live,
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:59.280]   the parent is required to fax a scan or video call with the company to allow that. And, you know,
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.240]   what happens is you're not going to do that. Whereas that's a very simple thing. The parent
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:08.400]   knows what's going on and the control is local and it changes it around. Makes it easier.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:13.120]   Yeah, I mean, it's a huge challenge to get this permission, permissions thing, the permissions
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:17.360]   thing right. I mean, I worry about the stuff I think about this stuff and I blow through the like,
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:22.480]   yeah, I'll allow an X, X, X screens myself during instant, you know, when I'm installing apps.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:27.680]   I think part of it is the onus is on companies and app developers to explain what's happening
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:33.440]   in very brief, very clear language, but also the onus is on the user to kind of look and see what
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:38.400]   does this need access to and then accepting. So we have to write better terms of service and
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:43.120]   privacy policies, you know, they can't be these long tomes and legalese, they have to be clear
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:47.840]   and brief. But at the same time, like, I want to teach my kid and hopefully things will be a lot
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:52.800]   farther along by the time she starts using these new platforms, you know, to think about the
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.920]   difference between, you know, I think there's like a spectrum of sharing information, right?
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.680]   There's like sharing your email address. That's one thing sharing photos and other things, sharing
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:03.120]   your location. That's another thing. And then they're sharing your social security number.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:07.280]   You know, that's a huge spectrum, you know, from one end to another. You know, under very few
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:12.320]   circumstances, she ever share her social security number, for example. But under many, she would
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:16.560]   share an email address. So I hope that I think that the experiences for these things will get
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.520]   better. It's a challenge. So it's a CX challenge. Yep.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:26.960]   This is actually, I recommend people read the entire section and all the different
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:32.640]   debaters. Some nice viewpoints. I mean, Gina, you're certainly the kind of the moderate in the
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:39.360]   bunch. You got Vivian Redding saying it's all up to the good laws. And then, you know, I almost,
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.720]   I hate to admit it, but agree with Jim Harper of the Cato Institute, who says, get over it.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:51.920]   And then his coda is that the children who take the lead in the information society will be the
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:57.440]   ones who learn from a young age, how to live in it. It's that moral panic again. What about the
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:02.560]   children? Exactly. Exactly. It's the effort to regulate the technology rather than the use,
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:08.720]   rather than behavior. I spoke at Lexus Nexus last week when I was down in Florida.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:15.360]   And this is the side of it that uses data for things like insurance and risk and all that.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:19.360]   One thing they said that I had no idea is that there's a national death registry.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:25.920]   And there's an effort to stop any use of that. You're dead. The fact that you're dead
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:31.360]   is not privacy anymore, right? But that's how far this has gone now. No, no, no, no, you can't know
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:36.480]   that. Well, there'll be a lot of there. There are some interesting loopholes, though. So there's,
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:42.000]   there's an actual file that's when you die, you can buy a file from the government that lists
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.440]   what your social security number was. And that by itself might not be private. But by looking at
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.880]   when people die and what their social security number was, things were sort of allocated in
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:57.440]   sequential order. And so you're able to guess the social security number of people who are alive.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:03.360]   And I can either confirm to an eye that I like, have went around and found a copy of that file just
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:07.280]   to play with it and see what sort of stuff you could do. It's, but it's pretty fascinating how
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:12.640]   sometimes you have unintended consequences. And, but I completely agree with your larger point,
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:16.640]   Jeff, that people often get a little too worried about it. You know, it's almost like there's an
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:22.080]   industry, as you've said, to sort of make privacy scares a thing. And now it's not just technology.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:27.840]   It is in you had the book last week, the book is that the notion of big data, Rick Smolin's book,
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:34.160]   which is very, very good, very, very huge big like big data. But the phrase big data has become so
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:40.560]   as become as freighted as anything with this fear, the techno panic. And I think we got to get off
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:47.120]   that. It's not its knowledge, right? At some point, it's merely knowledge. I was at something,
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:54.320]   I was at an economist event, and I'm rallying and tweeted that when books came out, that was big data.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.120]   Right. Oh my God, look at all this stuff. It was just knowledge. It's all it is.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:06.000]   Yahoo has upgraded to Flickr for iOS. Flickr for Android was updated similarly a couple of
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.080]   months ago. Yahoo mail has been significantly updated. It looks like Marissa Myers starting to
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:18.880]   get a, you know, get some traction over at Yahoo. Any thoughts on the new Yahoo mail?
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:26.480]   You got to switch your mail to Yahoo? No. I actually, I have family members who use Yahoo
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.240]   mail as their, as their, as their email address. I'm going to ask about this about the app. I've
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   been using Flickr actually quite a bit since my daughter was born just because I, I really like
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.280]   the tool and I kind of spreading the love across different, different service providers. So I'm
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.320]   really excited about this iPhone app upgrade. I mean, honestly, Flickr has been kind of, in my
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.000]   community, really just been like this tumble, tumbleweed blowing through just hasn't been a lot of
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.640]   people there. But I like the way that you can set up guest passes and that there's friends and family
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.720]   sharing kind of there's some, I like the privacy settings and Flickr, but the iPhone app update
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:05.200]   is amazing. It's awesome. Do you think the part of her strategy versus strategy was knowing how much
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:11.520]   geeks respect Flickr and care about it and didn't like the fact that it was orphaned,
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:17.680]   that that it was a smart place to go? Or was it, was it her Instagram?
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.640]   Well, consumer thing. I mean, I think so what was, it was like, dearmouristamire.com was like the
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.360]   first kind of website when she got hot CEO was like, please save Flickr. And then she, she, I think
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.080]   from one of the first things she did was, was, was, was assign a few employees to the, to the Flickr
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.800]   team. So yeah, I mean, I think this is, I mean, I, I like to think that she just knows that this
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.360]   is a beloved app that sort of got gotten dusty over the years and watching what happened with
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:48.000]   Instagram. And interestingly, Flickr also just added support for Twitter cards in this update,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.320]   right? So as Instagram pulls back and says, no, you can't, you know, embed our photos into
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.840]   onto Twitter, Flickr's going the other way and saying, yeah, so did Pinterest. Pinterest just
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:02.240]   did the same thing. So they're stepping in where, where angels fear to tread.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:08.800]   But, like inbox was overrun today with, with contact requests from Flickr because there's a
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:15.280]   find my friends function, a WhatsApp that uses your Twitter contacts and your Facebook. So,
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.960]   so I wonder if there was some conversation between Flickr and Twitter where Twitter's like, look,
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.960]   if you enable cards, we'll let you, you know, access our social graph, or if there was no
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.360]   conversation at all. And, and hopefully, you know, hopefully we won't see the story where Twitter
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.480]   says, well, we're just gonna, we're kind of cut off the social graph access. But hopefully that
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.920]   won't happen. So it's in a way, go ahead. I was gonna say, just go to the other way from,
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:44.000]   from Instagram. The, the mail thing is interesting because I got enraged a couple years ago. I had
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.760]   a Yahoo account and then they just killed it. And there was stuff in there. Yeah, I hadn't used
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.840]   it. Sorry, because it wasn't very good. It was dusty. It was just dead. And I complained about that
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.920]   as I tend to do on Twitter and lots of other people complain about the same thing. And I, to this day,
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   I wrote a blog post about it. And I still get somebody that comes in cursing Yahoo mail.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.720]   Well, all right, let's assume Marissa's gonna get over that kind of idiocy.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.200]   And I, she has real vision. You know, we talked about the show about the hyper personal news stream,
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.560]   the idea of services and tools and mail. I'm gonna bet that maybe not this version,
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.720]   but the long run, she's gonna do a spectacular job with it. But I just keep on thinking that
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.040]   that horse is left to barners over the horizon. Well, that's the problem. I mean, I have a Yahoo
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.800]   mail account, but I'm not gonna switch to it because I've already invested in Gmail, right?
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:30.400]   I've invested to the point of hundreds of dollars. Right. You know,
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:37.360]   and there's this tweet by Ryan Sarver, who's the director of platform at Twitter, who says,
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.480]   "I know X-Flicker people everywhere are cursing today. That's the app we always wanted to ship."
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.160]   So, you know, it's in some sense of Marissa's letting the core engineers get to the guts of
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.240]   what they've always wanted to do and freeing up the resources to do that. I've always been
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:57.680]   bullish on Marissa, you know, at Yahoo. And I think, you know, if this is part of her first
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.240]   initiative, I think it's a great first step to be taken. So... You're never gonna tell me the
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:07.520]   truth on this, but is there... What is... I'm gonna ask you anyway. You're all rooting for Marissa?
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.560]   I mean, are people looking across town and going, "You go girl," or what? I mean, you obviously know
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:17.920]   her well. Yeah, I would say... You know, I can't speak for Google as a whole, but I would say
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.040]   that people that I know are rooting for Marissa, in part because everybody at Google knows it's
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:28.000]   in our enlightened self-interest to have strong competition. And so, if we have, you know, Flicker
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.280]   and Instagram and Snap Seat on Google side and people are all, you know, competing, then the company
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.520]   that's the most proprietary, the most closed, you know, the least letting you have your data...
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.280]   Who would that be, Matt?
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.560]   Well, just in general, it doesn't treat you well, for whatever reason.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:47.120]   It doesn't let you have the best filters or whatever. You know, so I think that's what's good
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.840]   for users and that's gonna force everybody else to do a good job and compete on the merits. And
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.080]   that's exactly what we should want.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.120]   And I think you're right, Gina. Everybody's rooting for Flicker because we all love Flicker, right?
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.560]   We all... That was the first...
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.960]   It's such a great moment. I know people in our community are kind of fell icky about the
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.520]   Facebook acquisition and Instagram, so I'm hoping that this is the... Like, all of my friends go
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:15.040]   back to using Flicker. I hope this is the tipping day. I have a Flicker Pro account. I still have it.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.760]   I renew it every year. It's like 25 bucks. Totally worth it.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.600]   I let mine lapse for the first time in years. And I think...
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:29.840]   You know what I've done, though? I've gone to automatic upload on my devices now, and so
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.760]   I'm using Google+ photos.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:35.120]   Yeah, you know what's interesting about automatic upload is Facebook's doing it now,
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.400]   too. Did you notice that? Yeah.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:41.760]   Yeah. Just turned it on. So now on my iPhone, for instance, every picture I take is uploaded to
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:48.560]   Apple, Facebook, and Google. And we're worried about privacy? You didn't start up Dropbox?
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:55.280]   Oh, yeah. Dropbox. I forgot. Dropbox, too. It's like the least... Oh, I will never lose a picture.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.960]   Redunding cloud backup.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.280]   I don't think the Flicker app on Android doesn't have that feature yet,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.280]   but I wouldn't be surprised if they turned it on.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.080]   And they ate out of filters as well on on...
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.520]   They have filters, yeah.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.520]   Which I am losing a couple of days.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:11.920]   I'm so sick of filters.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.720]   No, but I think it's consensus is that filters are what made Instagram succeed, right?
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.680]   Yeah, that's...
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.200]   Because you feel like an artist with every picture you take. However crappy.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.520]   Hmm.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   The journalists get very haughty about it.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.720]   Oh, you must have used filters.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.120]   Oh, no, no, no. It's not that that you're faking news in history.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.440]   Oh, I don't think a sepia tone is ruined in the record.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.320]   But maybe, era.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:40.960]   I don't know.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.080]   I was playing this.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:46.640]   I don't trust my cell phone camera to have the perfect representation of lighting and...
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.680]   I agree.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.320]   I agree.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.360]   So this is the Flicker app on Android,
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.160]   which I think is actually they predated the Flicker app.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.680]   We don't have that show over the shoulder.
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.120]   I do, but it's way over there.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.480]   It was not like cameras get moved.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.480]   It was moved for all about Android.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.360]   Okay.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.880]   There we go. I'm gonna reach over here.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.320]   Thanks. Thanks for doing that one, Leo.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.920]   This is the new stretch.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.480]   So it does very have that kind of Instagram-y feel with the filters down here.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.200]   But the filters are named after cities.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.880]   So there's Tokyo, New York City is in black and white.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.160]   Do you know you want to explain that?
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.120]   Or actually, Jeff is...
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:21.920]   What are you all in?
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.640]   Yeah, what are you all in?
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.680]   It's the Woody Allen filter.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.200]   Should I just see what he's doing?
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:25.520]   Anything.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.080]   Oh, there it is.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.920]   And Berlin.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.120]   What is Berlin?
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.520]   You know what this is a lot slower than Instagram.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:32.480]   They're gonna have to work on that.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.640]   They're gonna have to work on that.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.000]   Paris.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.600]   I'm getting phone in, being again, Leo.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.120]   Yeah, is that a big phone?
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.720]   Boy, did you notice how big my phone is?
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.000]   I was walking one last week and I'm...
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.880]   It's so big.
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.760]   You know, they're not named after cities on iOS.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.560]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.440]   What do they name after?
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.120]   Named after animals.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.640]   Panda, mammoth, chameleon, walleyabana.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.640]   I can filter like that makes any sense at all.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.040]   To can.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.080]   To can.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.360]   Panda turned it black and white.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:01.920]   That would make sense.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.600]   Yeah, no, Panda must turn it black and white.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.240]   To can must turn it to a rainbow of colors.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:06.480]   Yes.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.640]   Panda is black and white.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:08.640]   What?
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.680]   As is walleyabine.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:13.120]   On the filters talk, we didn't put this in the doc,
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.840]   but Snapseed was released by Google for Android and iOS.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.320]   For free.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.600]   I just downloaded it on all three, yeah.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.640]   But again, you'd think,
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.040]   why don't you just integrate that into the Google+ app?
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.120]   Well, so you can share.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.200]   Because Twitter has aviary now in its app, right?
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:31.920]   So aviary...
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.800]   It came from Google.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.520]   They said it came from Nick Software when you downloaded it.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:35.760]   Good.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.120]   Thank God they're keeping it alive.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.560]   I hope they keep the desktop plugins alive.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.880]   That's that was my biggest concern.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.440]   You use those?
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:46.320]   Yeah, my wife has hooked on them.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.600]   She's been playing with the HDR mode and a lot of the different stuff.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.120]   Like, you know, these guys have been around for a long time.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   And yeah, if you haven't played with Snapseed,
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.920]   I can actually see Jeff's point about, you know, history
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.040]   and whether you're doing it accurately,
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.400]   because you can very easily click on a seed point of the sky
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.440]   and make it more or less blue and like change the gradient
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.240]   very quickly.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.840]   And you're like, well, you would never know
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.960]   that that was not the real sky,
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.240]   but it just looks more dramatic.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.880]   And so I can actually see where there'd be some concern about,
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.400]   you know, is that what was really happening?
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.160]   Or did you filter it up a little bit?
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.960]   But I think those of us, and I'm sure your wife too,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.440]   who know Nick loves Snapseed, it's not a bit, but it's an app.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.480]   And then Nick makes these desktop plugins for aperture
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.320]   and a lightroom that are spectacular.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.480]   And we would all just suffer with that.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:39.280]   So I do hope Google does what they can to keep HDR effects
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.800]   and color effects and vivasa and silver effects and sharpener
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:44.000]   and define it alive.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.320]   I'll keep a lot of me in this.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.200]   Would you please?
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.400]   It's great software.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.920]   Yeah, you want that to be available.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.680]   And it's, you know, it's pretty obvious.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.040]   Google bought it for Snapseed.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.040]   So that's what worries, I think it's where there's a lot of pros.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:57.680]   It's like, egh.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.320]   Of course, if they open sourced all that stuff,
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.840]   that wouldn't be so bad.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.880]   That would be pretty cool.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.320]   That would be really cool.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   Make it do it like when we bought the video Kodak
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.360]   and made that open source.
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.080]   Yeah, WebM, yeah.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.240]   I think that would be cool.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.240]   But I don't know what the plans are, so.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:12.480]   No.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.960]   You're not speaking for Google.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.680]   You need to have a lower third for Matt that just pops up and says,
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.640]   "I'm not speaking for Google."
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.680]   No, you can save yourself the effort.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.480]   It just fumbles.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.200]   Yes.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.080]   Please don't fire me.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:31.040]   So, Larry Page did an interview with Miguel Helft at...
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.160]   He can't speak for Google.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.080]   At Fortune, he does speak for Google.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.480]   And we'll talk about that in a minute,
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.240]   but I think this would be a good time for the changelog.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.120]   We don't want to get through the whole show like we did that other time.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.360]   And not have the trumpets.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.640]   So, if you will...
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.480]   The Google changelog!
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.840]   For so easily viewed.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:58.720]   Peter Tofani has the newest new stuff on Google.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.560]   The big launch, it was actually last week after we did the show last week,
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.000]   was Google+ Communities.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.080]   Do you have you guys played with this?
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.280]   Okay.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.720]   There's a quick community.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.480]   There's a group of Google+ users around a topic, right?
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.760]   So, you could have a twig community,
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.040]   you could have a photography community,
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.000]   or a food community.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.280]   And so, you probably, both of you, or all three of you,
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.080]   probably got inundated with invites to all sorts of communities.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.800]   And I'm actually still playing around with this.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.160]   But you joined a community and you could do posts on a certain topic
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.000]   just to people in that community,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.440]   and they're public and private.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.760]   And you can sort of have conversations about particular topics that you like.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.720]   I think I've joined a...
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.280]   Is there a twig community?
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:39.840]   I think there is.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.320]   Yes, there is.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:40.880]   You were showing up.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.280]   There is.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.480]   I have to join.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.640]   And yeah, it's pretty cool.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.080]   Have you guys played around with it?
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.640]   Are there any communities that are really hopping that we should join?
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.200]   Well, there's this is Sparta, Mike Elkins community,
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.120]   for people who love Greece.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.160]   So, I did this is Twit,
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.360]   because I said, "Well, what the hell?"
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.720]   And actually, Jeff, you were asking whether we should do a twig community.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.240]   I think what I'm going to do with Twit is
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.960]   we'll have a Twit community.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.080]   I also have a TechEye community,
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.920]   but we'll let each show create its own community, why not?
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.560]   Right?
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.920]   So, there should be a Twit community.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.880]   And I will keep hands off if you want to do it.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.440]   Go ahead.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.120]   But what's nice is you can add moderators.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.280]   So, for instance, the Twit community,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.600]   pretty much everybody who wants to, including,
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.800]   I think you guys are moderators there.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.560]   I don't know if I got elevated.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.560]   Oh, well, it's a pain to elevate,
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.760]   because you have to go through members,
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.480]   and now we already have 1640 members,
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.080]   so I have to go through them one by one and add moderators.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.600]   But most of the hosts are moderate.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.240]   Chadd, should you start the group?
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.760]   Twit group?
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.880]   I think Jeff should.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.920]   It doesn't matter.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.120]   It just whoever owns it.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:49.920]   Well, yeah, all right, I'll start it.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.920]   That way, you can never be fired.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.680]   Aha!
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.440]   All right, and you have the keys to the group.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.000]   I have.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.440]   It's just like being a professor.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.080]   I have.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:58.560]   Tenure.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.000]   Tenure to Jeff Jovez.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.160]   My reaction, and then we'll go on with change log,
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.360]   but just my reaction to Google+ communities is this is,
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.680]   this Google+ was kind of dribbling off.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.320]   None of my friends were there, and a lot of photographers.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.160]   I mean, there's activity there, but it wasn't,
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.720]   to me, it wasn't gripping the road.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.520]   Google+ communities is awesome,
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.200]   and may be exactly the feature.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.760]   To me, that could turn around Google+
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.920]   and make it a really valuable place.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.160]   As Google groups, which I used for a long time,
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.080]   have kind of gotten less interesting,
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.160]   this community takes over.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.600]   Yeah, it's considering changing a Google group
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.880]   that I run to a community.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.320]   Is that easier, do you,
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.400]   can you, is there a way to transfer it over?
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:42.880]   Probably not.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.920]   I don't believe there's a way to migrate,
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.680]   and I was thinking about just starting fresh and saying,
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.360]   "Everyone, hey, just do this."
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.480]   I get, you've got, you've got invitation, you know,
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.760]   events is built into it.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.160]   It's got the ability to have different,
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.280]   you know, discussion groups within the group itself.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.960]   The notifications, of course, are perfection.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.040]   This is a selfie group, I think I'll join that.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.480]   Anything itself I'm all about.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.880]   There's an internal group at Google dedicated to Tesla,
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.120]   and I joined that, and it's incredibly addictive,
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.200]   and I'm like, "Must not buy Tesla."
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.840]   Yeah, yeah, that's the upside of that.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.880]   Yeah, it's an expensive community to join.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.080]   Yeah, it's an expensive community.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.760]   So it looks like inside that this is Twit Group,
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.000]   there are discussions set up for each show.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   I set up some discussions, but,
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.600]   oh, I guess, oh, really, they put it,
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.120]   oh, they did so many made discussions for the shows.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.960]   Interesting.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.040]   We're going to get a group right now.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.840]   So, but I think each show should have its own discussion,
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.160]   because otherwise, this will get unwieldy fast.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.960]   And that is the one negative on Google groups,
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.600]   a very, very active group would kind of swamp you
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.280]   with content.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.720]   Echad, can you send me a larger version of our logo?
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.040]   Yeah, yeah, get on that.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.160]   I don't have it here, so it might be a future one.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.600]   Yeah, what I did with Team Tech guys
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.480]   use the album art, which is probably the most recognizable graphic
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.120]   to go with a community.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.920]   What's the, do you know what the biggest community is right now?
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.320]   Do we know?
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:11.200]   We can't sort by size, so.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.440]   Maybe photography, I'm not sure.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.400]   Yeah, it would be surprise.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.120]   There are a lot of photographers.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:15.920]   It would be surprised.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.960]   12, 16,000 makers, hackers, artists, and engineers,
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.440]   19,000 space.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.960]   There's some big communities, 12,000 Star Wars members.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.800]   So, there's some big communities.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.920]   This is, I think to me, this might, it's funny,
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.120]   because it's so social, it's so interesting.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.640]   You could just, the one right feature could flip the whole thing on its head.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.720]   And the one wrong feature, as my space learned, can kill you.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.440]   Well, in the Laurie Page interview, I think it was in there.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.200]   That was the first time I've heard Laurie and Eric kind of
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.600]   position themselves against Facebook.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.040]   Yeah, we'll get to that.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.000]   But let's continue with it.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.200]   We're not, we're not this.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.200]   Let's continue with the change law,
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.640]   because I don't want to get a sign track, but I did want to talk about communities,
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.520]   because I think it's big.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:06.000]   She knows, it's a huge story.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.480]   It's really the biggest launch of the week.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:08.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.480]   A few other little things.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.600]   Well, we talked about the YouTube resign earlier with Lamar.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.000]   Google Apps has changed to Google Apps, and no longer available for free.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.680]   So there used to be a free sign up for individuals.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.840]   Now it's the business version only.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.400]   So people who already have a free Google Apps account,
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:31.920]   those they will continue, but they're just new member sign up for the free package.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.880]   So basically you have to sign up for a business account,
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.320]   which I believe is $50 per user per year,
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.760]   includes phone support and all that other stuff.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.480]   I'm a huge, I'm a big Google Apps user.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.560]   One of the reasons why I really like Google Apps is you can associate your domain name with it.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.800]   So if I wanted to change email providers,
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.040]   if I had some crazy day where I want to switch to Yahoo mail or some other email provider,
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.600]   I could do that because my email address doesn't change.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.640]   But I guess, Matt, it looks like you added a link in here.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.440]   There's a little hack to still sign up for Google Apps.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.040]   Who quick, tell me how.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.320]   It's on digital inspiration.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.160]   It looks like you have to sign up with App Engine.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.880]   I actually haven't tried this out, but it's an elavinal.org.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.800]   So this is one of these things where I hope it's not a firing, Matt occasion.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:29.520]   So as I understand it, Google App Engine needs to authenticate.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.240]   So if you want to run your app on some other domain or something like that,
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.000]   you actually right now need to authenticate using Google Apps.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.360]   And so if they were charging for Google Apps, then you wouldn't be able to use Google App Engine
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.200]   on some other domain for free.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.240]   And so there's this write up that basically talks about,
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.560]   if you go in via Google App Engine, because it actually checks your referrer,
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.520]   then you can still sign up.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.360]   Now you don't get 10 people for free.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.080]   I think you get one account on a domain for free.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.440]   I actually hadn't set it up on any of my Google Apps on any of my domains,
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.840]   because I usually just use a Gmail for my personal stuff.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.000]   But I try to, and as of like Sunday, it worked.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.440]   I don't know whether it'll stay up.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.600]   I don't know if eventually App Engine will say,
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.360]   okay, you don't have to authenticate with Google Apps.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.960]   So if you do want to try this, you might want to try it right now.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:22.640]   I don't know what the lifespan will be on this particular method.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.400]   Quickly doing that.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.400]   And you know, I can say, as a Google Apps user forever,
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.920]   there are times when Google Apps users don't get features as quickly as regular kind of vanilla
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.000]   Google account users. And there's plenty of ways,
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.680]   if you just want a custom email address,
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.920]   like there are plenty of ways to do that with regular Gmail.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.400]   You don't need a Google Apps account to set your, you know,
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.640]   your from your sent address or to get your mail from another provider.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.320]   I mean, Gmail has tons of those tools built in,
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.160]   and just, you know, you're free Google account.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:54.000]   So it's not that big a deal, but something to note.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.240]   Let's see. What else do we have?
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:00.800]   Oh, Google launched the new Chrome extension called Save to Drive.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:06.080]   It makes it easy to save an image or a page or web page,
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.440]   the HTML or web archive, which is a .mht file.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.160]   That was a new one on me to Google Drive.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.000]   So you install the extension, you can right click,
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.160]   and you can save things directly to drive.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.680]   And a couple of new ways to work with images as well.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:25.680]   You can zoom by scrolling or you can leave a comment about a specific part of an image
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.280]   that you've saved in Drive or leave comments on the side.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:30.400]   Pretty cool.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.080]   Gina, question on Drive. Quick question.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.160]   Because I'm an idiot.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.000]   There's no folders or tags there, is there?
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.960]   In Drive itself.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.920]   Drive itself.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.920]   Yeah, there are folders. There are folders in Drive.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.280]   There's no tags. No tags.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.400]   No. No, no tag.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.000]   Correct me if I'm wrong, Matt. I'm pretty sure that they're just folders.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.400]   That's a really good question.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.480]   I think that it's just folders.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.320]   It's kind of like in Gmail, you can have labels.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.240]   You can recreate both folders and tags.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.960]   The impression I have is that in Drive,
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.640]   it's usually going on a folder model rather than a tag model.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.120]   I was getting the like the Evernote model with tags.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.680]   That's good feedback. I'll actually pass that on to the people who want to say.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.880]   This is the great thing about having Matt on the show.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.080]   Like a broadcast news moment.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.240]   It goes from my mouth into his ear into the computers around the world.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.360]   It's a great thing.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:27.120]   Well, you were talking about your Chromebook and losing some data from Evernote
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:31.280]   because of the way Evernote wasn't like locally saving or wasn't refreshing data.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.000]   And so that's like one of those things where it's like,
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.560]   okay, is there stuff we can do to help make that a little bit better?
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.920]   So that's good feedback.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.920]   You know, tags would be helpful there.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:43.280]   Yeah, I think I've been in connection with Rick buyer.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:47.280]   Somebody from the Chrome team who was great.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.800]   He reached out to me and I made some suggestions and he put in some bug reports.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.480]   And I'm still using it.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.840]   Yay!
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.760]   Did you see some of them are dropping down to $99?
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:03.600]   Well, for schools through donors choose.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.200]   Donors choose is a great organization where teachers can come in and ask for things.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.920]   And so until I think December 20 something,
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.160]   you could go find a school, find a teacher once it,
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.360]   and you can pay down the index and get a Chromebook into a school.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.520]   So a hundred dollar laptop.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:18.960]   Didn't mean to hijack the...
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.840]   No, no, no, it's great.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.360]   No, no, no, it's great.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.000]   It's huge.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.560]   I won last change log item and this is something Jeff found.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.520]   This is pretty interesting.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:31.200]   Google's search results, it's called the knowledge graph,
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.600]   right? That sidebar now lists side effects and information about drugs.
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.200]   So if you search for say a seed of minifin in Google,
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.440]   you'll get one of those panels on the right side.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.160]   Oh, that's great.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.960]   And yeah, it's fantastic.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.240]   And actually not only side effects, lots of different information about whether or not.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:48.880]   So I can't...
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.240]   My hard drug is Rivmal.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:54.320]   And if you look at that, you'll find that it's a really useful
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:54.960]   list of things.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.720]   And be careful with the seed of minifin because it'll kill you.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.720]   Seriously.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.040]   And that's all I got.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.320]   Another story for another day.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.560]   No, it's easy to overdose on the seed of minifin.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:11.680]   And it's in a lot of stuff.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.800]   It probably says that right there.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.720]   It's very...
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.760]   I think they should ban it.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.680]   But anyway...
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:21.840]   And I just signed up for a Google app for free.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.480]   So that's cool.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.880]   [laughter]
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.160]   She didn't want to do it before they turned that back door off.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.600]   Get grandfathered in there.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:34.640]   It looks like that search trick works if you search for the brand as well.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.120]   So if you search for Tylenol, I'll give you the information about
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:37.760]   a seed of minifin.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.120]   If you search for Advil, you get the...
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.320]   That's what I just did.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.440]   You can see it's only Tylenol.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:47.440]   Yes, the possible side effects lists are lovely.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.200]   Actually, I know a young woman who died from a seed of minifin.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.800]   Oh, it's very easy to do.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:53.840]   It was accidental overdose.
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.360]   Because it's in a lot of stuff that you don't know.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.680]   And it has a very low toxic...
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.520]   toxicity.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.920]   So don't mess with it.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.240]   On that note...
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.040]   Bad for your liver.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.360]   Seriously.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.040]   I don't know why it's...
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.080]   Well, that's sad.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.040]   No.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:13.920]   It's sad.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.520]   And that's your changelog and Tylenol warning.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.040]   [laughter]
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.680]   Uh, moving along.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:28.320]   Larry Page sat down last month with Miguel.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.120]   It's a pages only, pages second big interviews since his...
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.320]   ascendancy to CEO 70-minute conversation.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:43.280]   And do you guys want to pick out some highlights on here?
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.960]   There was some good stuff in there.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:49.440]   Um, they asked, "What else would you change in a world with self-driving cars?
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.600]   Would we not have streetlights?
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.560]   Would the cities be different?
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.320]   Do you have a vision for what could happen?"
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.920]   He says, "It's hard to predict.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.000]   I think you know one of the issues we face here is parking.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.800]   The cost for a parking structure is about 40,000 of space.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.240]   Google's actually faced with this, right?
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.400]   It's all concrete and still.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:09.120]   Do you really want to use all your concrete and still to build parking lots?
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.480]   Seems pretty stupid.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:13.440]   If we had automated cars or even some fraction of them,
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.720]   we'd save hundreds of millions of dollars on parking garages.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.520]   Just at Google.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.240]   Just at Google.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.560]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.760]   When things...
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.520]   When you get to scale, things change.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.040]   Uh, go ahead.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.200]   He had one part that was pretty good about...
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.880]   One of his challenges is to try to keep people thinking about,
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.760]   "How do you think big?
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.880]   How do you be ambitious?"
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.800]   And you know, that's something he cares about is,
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.200]   you know, what are the big, hairy, ambitious goals
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.560]   that Google should be tackling in the next year or the next five years?
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:47.440]   And I think the way that he said it in the past is,
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.400]   you know, the easiest thing to do when you come in in the morning
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.840]   is the thing that you did yesterday.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.000]   But that's not always the best thing that you should do
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.440]   for the company or for the world.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:55.760]   Right.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.560]   And that's, you know,
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.840]   that sticks in your mind a little bit.
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.840]   Instead of just getting locked into blinders,
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.160]   "I'm going to do things this way or I'm going to do things that way."
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.800]   How do you come at it and try to come up with a different approach
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:05.840]   or something more ambitious?
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:08.880]   Because his point is always that people don't try the ambitious stuff.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:14.320]   Um, he talks about competition and Miguel to his credit just will not let it go.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.840]   Miguel starts in the old world of desktop search.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.320]   Your main competitors at the time were Yahoo and Microsoft
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.920]   is a competition now, something totally different.
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.480]   Is it Siri?
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.080]   Is it Amazon for commercial queries?
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.800]   Larry says, "I don't really think about it that way."
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.120]   Because you don't think about the competition?
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.280]   Obviously we think about the competition at some extent,
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.360]   but I feel my job is mostly getting people
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.600]   not to think about our competition,
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.400]   which I think is the right thing.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.960]   Yeah, the question is, what would an ideal search engine do?
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.920]   Or if you had all this technology, what would you do?
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.760]   Not just like, "I'm not the last person to do it."
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.560]   What is your competitor?
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:53.120]   The last thing you should do is be reactive in that way.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.760]   He says, "Apple's still a partner.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.960]   This is Miguel.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.680]   It's a competitor.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.440]   You and Steve Jobs are friendly."
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.720]   Larry says, "At times."
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:06.320]   I like that.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.240]   You said he said something about it.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:14.880]   For the first time, both Eric and Larry kind of admitted to competing with Facebook,
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.000]   Jeff.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.600]   No, that was in other things, I think.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.840]   Maybe it was in other things, but I think I've seen that.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.240]   He says, "We talked to Apple.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.320]   We have a big search relationship with Apple and so on,
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.400]   so we talked to them and so on."
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:32.320]   He says that Google+ is a big bet.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.720]   Actually, Miguel said that and he agreed.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.440]   I think it's gone pretty well and pretty happy.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.840]   If users of Plus are happy and the numbers are growing
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.680]   because that means we're on to something,
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:43.760]   we've got a huge team actually in this building.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:47.680]   If you walk around, you see everyone's excited and running around and working hard on it.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.400]   Well, that's nice.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.160]   He said he's never satisfied.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.000]   That's his personality and his job.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:54.480]   Shouldn't be.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:58.960]   That's the difference to me and Larry Page because I'm completely satisfied.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.440]   I'm very happy.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.800]   He's a content man.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.240]   Yeah, I'm content.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:09.200]   It's a worthwhile interview.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.160]   I'm not sure.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.880]   Any good CEO, actually, Larry did this very well.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.680]   Any good CEO is not going to say anything of material,
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.640]   but he gave the impression of saying things that were material
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.800]   without actually saying anything of material.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:21.520]   That's a good...
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.480]   That's actually...
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.840]   That's A+.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.120]   Because usually they say, "Well, I can't talk about that.
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.240]   I'm not going to tell you that."
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.200]   He seemed like he was really being candid.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:34.240]   For instance, Miguel says, "How long do you see yourself as being CEO?"
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:34.880]   Last question.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.000]   I don't know.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.240]   Seems impossible to predict.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.520]   Like I said, I'm motivated to make Google into something even more amazing.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.480]   We have a tremendous positive impact on the world, ultimately.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.240]   He completely deflects.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.480]   We're still number one.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.560]   We're still 1% to where we should be.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.760]   I feel a deep sense of responsibility to try to move things along.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.080]   Not enough people are focused on big change.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.960]   Part of what I'm trying to do is take Google as a case study
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:04.400]   and really scale our ambition, such that we are able to cause
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.280]   more positive change in the world and more technological change.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.520]   I have a deep feeling we're not even close to where we should be.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.160]   I like that.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.440]   That's a technologist talking.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:16.240]   And Larry's pretty consistent on that.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.200]   He's trying to get people to think bigger.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:25.680]   And I really feel like he views Google as a platform by which to make the world a better place
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:28.160]   and have a technological impact.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.640]   And so he's looking at the world of possibility and asking,
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.960]   "Why aren't we doing all these different things?"
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.000]   And then, "How do we get to?
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.600]   We have the people and the resources and the ability to do those things
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.520]   rather than, okay, having a business model."
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.520]   Amazing, because you're right.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.720]   Google does more than so many other institutions have the power and ability and resources.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.040]   And thus, the fact that he feels that responsibility, I think is great.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.760]   And I love that you can tell he's a programmer and engineer because
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:59.120]   Miguel says, "One of the first instances of plus being woven into other Google services
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:28:59.680]   was in search.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.160]   There was a fair amount of criticism in some cases
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.080]   where somebody's not an active user of Google+,
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.760]   you put their profile in search results.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.920]   Lady Gaga was the example we used.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.080]   That's not necessarily the best use of that real estate.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.200]   And some people went as far as saying,
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.720]   "You were betraying the promise of always giving the best unbiased search results.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:15.680]   What's your reaction?"
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.920]   And he says, "Well, what you should want to do is really build amazing products
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.680]   and really go with the long-term focus.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.040]   We think about it somewhat differently."
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.000]   And this is the programmer.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.600]   We're going to have people as a first-class object in search.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.640]   Yes.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.480]   I was all...
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.520]   It's people dot search.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:34.080]   Got it.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.720]   I was really surprised nobody took that completely out of context and said,
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.040]   "You want people as a first-class object?"
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.840]   Because that is a programmer speaking.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.360]   Like, people should be...
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:49.520]   We should understand who people are and the relationships that we can help improve things for them.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.400]   But saying it's a first-class data type is a very techy thing.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.360]   Right. I love it.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.720]   I love it.
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.080]   I thought, "God, that's great.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:00.080]   I am surprised nobody took that out of context."
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.960]   Oh, everyone knows that's nerd.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:03.520]   That's nerd.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.000]   Nerd talk.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:04.880]   You know, yeah.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:05.440]   Nerd speak.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:09.760]   First-class object.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.600]   I want to be a first-class object in search.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.080]   I want a Google T-shirt.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.880]   Actually, though, as much fun as we're making of that,
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.680]   I think that that actually is really a telling statement.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.320]   Well, and Gina, you are a first-class object in search.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.360]   Because if you search for Gina,
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:29.760]   "Trapani," like, you're in the knowledge graph because of Wikipedia.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:33.280]   So there's pictures and then we want to know the connections and the nodes
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:37.680]   so that we can say, people who search for you also look for Jeff Jarvis and Leo LaPorte.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:42.880]   And it's kind of funny being actually rolled out something very similar this past week.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:47.040]   And it's based off the same data, this free-based data where we acquired the company.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.960]   And it's based off of Wikipedia as well.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:53.600]   But it just shows all the search engines are trying to get to answers and trying to understand
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.240]   the world more.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:57.040]   So you are a first-class data type.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:58.000]   I know.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.680]   When I saw that that panel, I felt very first-class.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:07.840]   I also felt pretty first-class when author attribution rolled out.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.400]   That was a house.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.120]   That's nice too.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:09.840]   I love that.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:15.920]   Just to defend Google+ after my remarks.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.400]   More than-
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.760]   You're going to eat crow, Mr.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:20.880]   Well, it's numbers.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.280]   I keep hearing these numbers, but I got to tell you,
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.520]   it still doesn't feel like it's a vibrant community.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.720]   More than half a billion people have upgraded, I guess,
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:34.320]   that means they're using Google+ 235 million active across Google+
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.680]   wanting apps and Google Play hanging out in Gmail, writing reviews and maps.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:41.040]   And 135 million are active in the stream.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.200]   That's the real number, 135 million users.
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:46.480]   Because hanging out in Gmail doesn't mean you're a Google+ user.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:49.040]   It just means you're hanging out in Gmail.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:53.120]   But 135 million, nothing to sneeze at.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.160]   Speaking of numbers, half a billion dollars,
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.280]   that's the amount that Google and Apple are paying together.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.320]   Together.
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:04.640]   Together.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:09.360]   Together in harmony for the Kodak patents.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.960]   This was necessary for Kodak to exit.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.920]   It's chapter 11.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:16.480]   And so that's good news for Kodak.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.880]   And I think in a way, good news,
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.720]   because it's saying that Google and Apple are going to jointly own these patents.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.160]   I presume, or maybe they're going to divvy them up.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.520]   I don't know how that works.
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.200]   I will sue you over these.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.720]   You sue us over those.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:29.120]   I know.
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:33.840]   I would guess it means fewer suits, but I don't know.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:39.040]   What struck me about that is that, okay, so now Kodak doesn't make film.
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.240]   It doesn't make pictures.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:43.040]   It doesn't own photographic patents.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.280]   Why does it exist?
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.520]   There's this because of equity markets.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.640]   You've got to try to hold on and make those things still live on.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.480]   But it's nothing like what it was.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.640]   It might as well just have died.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.680]   I am loving Google now, by the way.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.400]   And now it's coming to Chrome, apparently.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.000]   I think Google now should be everywhere.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:08.400]   And I didn't realize this, but Google now is going to now offer activity summaries.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.800]   But only once a month, it says, which is so weird.
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.840]   I wanted every day.
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.040]   If it's there, I wanted every day.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.040]   I'm carrying around my Fitbit.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.520]   I mean, I'm not my Nike fuel band.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.960]   I was ready to buy a Fitbit, but if Google can be my Fitbit, I want it.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.360]   It could do exactly the same thing, couldn't it?
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:24.960]   Right?
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.360]   Well, hopefully.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.960]   But you have to remember the Fitbit.
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:32.480]   It works for five or six days before recharging.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:36.000]   The phone to have the accelerometer always on could sap some power.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.200]   So until they come up with some low power way to do it,
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:44.240]   you might be recharging your phone every afternoon or every night, something like that.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:46.640]   But it's certainly the case.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.000]   I love Google now as well.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.560]   And I think it's pretty funny that at the beginning of this year,
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.800]   a lot of people were like, how dare Google have a unified privacy policy
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:56.960]   much like all the other tech companies do.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.760]   And yet it's exactly that sort of thing that allows you to say, hey, you've got a meeting,
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:05.120]   you know, 20 miles up the peninsula and traffic is bad.
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.040]   So show me a little alert that says leave now.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.600]   Google now is my response to this whole privacy and apps thing is like,
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:14.560]   but if you give them information, it's amazing.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:19.120]   The synergy of because Google knows everything I do,
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.040]   well, they could tell me good stuff.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:24.720]   Like they tell me every morning, you better leave for your Pilates class.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.400]   Now you got five minutes.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.320]   It knows it knows that I go there every morning.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.000]   It knows how long it takes to get there.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.320]   And it actually tells me it's time to go.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.400]   Come at me about this on the show.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.240]   I don't get enough of my Google now.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.120]   I want more.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:37.920]   Yeah, he needs more.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.440]   Yeah, he gives me two cards.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.320]   It's giving me Facebook stock and the weather.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:42.720]   That's it.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:49.520]   How do I, I've a million times said, yes, you could share everything you want with it
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.040]   and then all this kind of stuff, but I don't get enough.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.800]   I actually agree with you because twice in the last week,
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:00.240]   I've run into really bad traffic jams and parking lot on one on one.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.120]   And I'm like, come on, Google, you know I'm going to work,
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.280]   or you know that I'm driving down the street on the way home.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.520]   Let me know that I should go some other route.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.200]   So as far as I'm concerned, yes, you do have to worry about
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.880]   eventually becoming too annoying, but I'd like to see it more as well.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.080]   I think it makes sense to think it would gradually roll out these features.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.280]   So it's not to, not to.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.560]   So you're getting the fitness thing, Jeff, are you seeing that?
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.440]   Because I haven't seen it yet.
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.960]   No, I haven't got it yet.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.800]   I just found the article, but I didn't know that it was kind of hidden
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.520]   in the December five announcement of the new Google Mal.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.080]   Excited.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.480]   And so it says that once a month it'll have that.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.440]   It's part of the travel thing.
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.960]   Like I said, knows how far you've gone.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.760]   It knows how it goes when you are sleeping and knows when you're awake.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.600]   And it tells you how many miles you've biked and how many miles you've walked.
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.280]   It would be cool if it was like you drove this many miles and you'd,
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.080]   you know, spend this much on gas or use this much gas or here's this route that you've
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.120]   taken over and over again.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:58.480]   If you take this other, you know, turn, you'll save this much in gas or time.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:01.600]   I mean, you really can see, I feel like Google now is just this dark horse.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.680]   I feel like it's just going to keep getting better and better.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.360]   Like it just feels like the perfect interface.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.080]   It feels like it should be the interface on Google on Google Glass.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.440]   It's just, it's a really, really, really good product.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.840]   Not a lot of people know about it or talk about it yet.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:21.520]   I don't know if that's just because it's sort of new or it's just on new versions of Android or what.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.760]   Got the issue, you know.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.200]   But I think by this time next year, people will be talking about Google now a lot more.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.640]   Wow.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.440]   Snoop Dogg's coming to the Phoenix next Saturday.
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.480]   Oh, sorry.
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.680]   Actually, I'm on the list.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:38.400]   Go see Snip.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:39.840]   It's right across the street.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:43.280]   Did you ever do show more cards, Jeff?
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.040]   Did you get more cards when you showed more?
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:45.840]   No.
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.840]   At the bottom, it says show more cards.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.600]   I have a tip for this.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:52.880]   Jeff, do you happen to know if you're signed into your apps account on Chrome
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.760]   and then signed into a different account on Google now?
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.040]   Because if you are signed into two different accounts,
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:36:59.600]   it wouldn't know.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.160]   I did that.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.160]   I've shifted everything to my apps account.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.400]   The only thing that's not is because damn you Google,
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:10.240]   I'm still stuck with my other address for my Google Plus account.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:11.200]   Ah, there you go.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:11.280]   That's why.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:12.800]   Because it's pre-apps.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.160]   You got everything else.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.200]   Everything else.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.800]   Calendar, email, everything is on my apps address.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.640]   Google now and the phone and the device are my apps address.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:28.880]   So there is a path where you can try to migrate your personal Gmail to your apps account on Google Plus.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.200]   My guess is you could try that.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.320]   And then if you run it in any obstacles, we could probably try to make sure that
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.160]   everybody gets migrated correctly.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.920]   But I'll see if I can find the link and post it in the rundown chat, Jeff.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.240]   Okay.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.080]   Okay. This is my week we can plank.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:48.320]   We like the tech support sessions.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.080]   We got to have the number of the week we shifted to Jeff's line of the week.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.760]   I love it.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.320]   For instance, if you're in a different country with different currency,
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.240]   it'll show you currency conversions.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:00.720]   I mean, there's just so much cool stuff.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.080]   I want Google to take over my life.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:02.720]   It already has.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.320]   I basically gave up.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:06.000]   Take me Google.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:06.560]   I'm yours.
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.360]   But there's one thing I got a bone to pick with you, Matt cuts.
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.400]   Uh oh.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.920]   Uh oh.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:18.800]   Google tweets image search to make porn harder to find.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.520]   Did you do that?
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.120]   I did not do that.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.720]   But I knew that was coming.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.680]   Hey.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.640]   Careful.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.040]   So how long of an answer do you want?
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.760]   I like it long.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.520]   Oh, dear.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:37.920]   From now on, the whole show is going to be double untandere.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:40.080]   Just because of you.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.280]   Show title.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.480]   Go to great, great lower third, great lower third.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.040]   That's a.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.880]   Yes, please.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:47.920]   I'm very, thank you.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:49.360]   Don't kill me.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:55.680]   So if I type porn in my uh search and I do an image search,
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:00.640]   I'm less likely to get a little bit less likely.
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.000]   So the reason actually is.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.600]   I'm getting some good stuff here, actually.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.520]   Oh, man.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.480]   So there's a historical artifact, which is when we did save search for web search,
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.880]   it could either be on or it could be off.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.160]   And that makes sense.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.600]   The problem is when you start to apply that to image search, well, we don't want to,
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:21.920]   you know, assume people don't want anything by default, but we also don't want porn,
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.360]   you know, loading up and everybody searches.
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:26.560]   And so we had a middle ground for image search that was called moderate.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.920]   And that would say, you know, when you're in moderate mode, which was the default,
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:34.800]   okay, just sort of don't show uh, you know, unless you're really, really sure that someone's
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.000]   looking for porn.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.680]   Our job is to help you find what you want.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:40.800]   If we're really, really sure that you're looking for porn, maybe then fine.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:43.200]   But otherwise for the most part, trying not to just like,
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.320]   brawd you, you know, throw a bunch of porn in your face.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:47.120]   Right.
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:51.920]   And so, but at the same time, having all these different settings is a little bit complicated.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:56.400]   So we're trying to simplify things and just say, okay, safe search is on or safe search is off.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.960]   And so we've moved that setting over to image search.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:00.880]   And now on image search, if you want to, you can click.
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.120]   There's a safe search button in the right hand side.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:08.480]   And you can select exactly what level of, you know, you do where you don't want safe search on or off.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.520]   And that's it now.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.320]   It's just binary.
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.520]   It's either on or it's off.
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:12.000]   Okay.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.080]   Instead of having three settings, which is a little weird.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.640]   So I can't get moderately sexy pictures anymore.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:23.120]   Well, so again, it depends on how long you want to go on the porn stuff.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:28.160]   But, but it's just for porn, just search for porn terms and really explicit porn terms.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.120]   And you'll get it.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:29.600]   So up.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.040]   But if you search for like bikinis, we don't know that that's what you're looking for.
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.400]   So we'll air towards being a perfect sense.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.400]   So the old report nude, you would assume, I mean, no one I'm going to get.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.080]   Those pictures, I took them out of circulation there, I think.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:44.800]   I was young.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:45.680]   I needed the money.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:53.440]   We have an entire team of people whose job it is to do well on porn searches.
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:57.840]   And so we think about what are called porn seeking queries and their job is to make sure
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.360]   we wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on right there. This is too good.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.680]   So there's a porn department at Google.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.320]   Of course there is.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:04.720]   It's huge.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.440]   You've got to be.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:06.400]   It's massive.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.640]   And it comes with therapy, doesn't it?
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:08.960]   I mean.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.520]   I remember reading an article by somebody who was doing that.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:16.000]   And we just said, it just wears on you after a while.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.920]   You get a little bit in your to it after a while.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:20.400]   Yes.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:23.280]   But I was reading the slash article one time and they're like,
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.400]   Oh man, imagine being the porn person at Google.
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.480]   That would be the best job in the entire world.
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:31.360]   And I was reading safe search and I was like, well, that is an okay job.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:32.400]   It doesn't suck.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.920]   You get tired after a while.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:37.920]   But there are a lot of people who would actually maybe want to do that job.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.320]   Group of independent chairs, they're well-trusted.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:41.600]   It's the same thing my son says.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:44.000]   I'd like to be a video game tester when I grow up.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:44.880]   It's not.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.400]   It takes all the fun out of it.
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:46.640]   Right.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:46.720]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:48.880]   And it's not as fun.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.320]   Now, but you did do something right.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:53.920]   Because when I search for Christmas on Google, I get Christmas stuff.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.680]   When I search for Hanukkah stuff.
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.120]   But when I search for my favorite holiday Festivus,
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:04.560]   I not only get a search results, I get an actual Festivus poll on the web page.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:06.000]   Yes.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.760]   That is crazy, man.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.280]   I feel good.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:13.280]   This is, I actually proposed this Easter egg and I, oh, yay.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:17.920]   Now, yeah, because Paul Buckeye, I remember years and years ago,
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.880]   he had left Google and he was at Friend Feed and he was saying,
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.480]   yeah, they do Hanukkah and they do Christmas doodles.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.320]   But I've never seen a Festivus Easter egg.
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:30.160]   Hey, how hard, and of course, our doodle team is phenomenal.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.720]   And so in like two hours, they're like, oh, how about this?
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.400]   And you're like, wow, that's incredible.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:35.520]   Yes, that would be wonderful.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.520]   It's a Festivus miracle.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.640]   And I think we have our own Festivus poll here at the studio,
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.720]   which almost killed me, by the way, the other day,
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.120]   because it wasn't completely hooked up.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.280]   So Festivus is a, for those of you.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.280]   I thought that was your stripper's poll, Leo.
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:54.000]   I do have an amazing core, but I'll show you that another time.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.480]   Festivus, for those who don't remember, was a fake holiday invented
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.680]   on the Seinfeld show.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.160]   So much.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:03.040]   But it's by George Costanz, of course.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:09.120]   But the truth is, in this politically correct era,
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:11.760]   I think it's better to wish us all a happy Festivus.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.360]   It's a non-denominational holiday.
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:18.080]   I didn't know this, but it's December 23rd.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:22.000]   So you can celebrate most.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.200]   Most of all, yeah.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:23.840]   You get them all.
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:27.600]   And of course, there's an aluminum pole.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:30.720]   There's no Christmas tree, but it's an aluminum pole set up like a Christmas tree.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:32.880]   It needs no decoration.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.480]   The annual airing of grievances and feats of strength are very important.
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.280]   You know, it's actually based on one of the staff writers
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:44.960]   who actually did have it as a fake holiday in his family.
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.320]   Oh, my God.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.680]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.600]   A Festivus and like the war on Festivus, and it's pretty crazy.
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.040]   Congratulations, Matt.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.040]   You have made a permanent mark on the world.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.080]   I think that's the greatest.
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.840]   A great Easter egg.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.320]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:00.800]   Thank you.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.960]   Christmas and Hanukkah and all those.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:04.720]   So if you search for those, you'll also see.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.640]   I didn't see anything.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.160]   So if I do it, okay.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:11.280]   You know, assuming we can spell Hanukkah, which.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:14.880]   Well, that's, you know, the truth is when I want to know how to spell Hanukkah,
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:15.680]   you know where I go?
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:22.320]   You mean, you mean, H-A-N-U-K-K-H-A-H-A-H-A-H-A-O?
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.440]   Oh, that Hanukkah, yeah.
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:23.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.600]   See, there's the little stars of David.
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.360]   I didn't see anything for Christmas.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.400]   Let me do Christmas again.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.400]   Oh, Christmas.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:31.440]   Let's spell it right.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.800]   I don't see anything.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.400]   It gets closer to the day.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.520]   It is Hanukkah now.
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.320]   That's why, right?
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:41.440]   Well, some Festivus is awfully far away.
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:43.040]   You guys have something against Christians.
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:44.320]   No.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:47.520]   It's the war on, hey, box news.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.360]   Google has a war on Christmas.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:54.560]   You're just laughing, but somebody literally did do that article
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:56.160]   because they can't help themselves.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.200]   It's unbelievable.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.640]   We are joking.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.320]   It's not true.
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:05.040]   Oh, we have so much more we could talk about.
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:10.080]   The ITU is just winding up their secret, super secret meeting in Dubai.
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:14.080]   I don't know if I...
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.440]   I went to the ITU site just to see what they were saying.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.360]   And Tunisia had tried to pass a statement from the ITU saying simply
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.680]   that the rights you have in life, you have online.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:27.840]   And they wouldn't do it.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.080]   And instead, honest to God with straight face,
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:34.480]   they ordered that the director shall release a strongly worded press release.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:43.520]   Hey, sometimes a strongly worded press release is all it takes.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:44.800]   Just ask read Hastings.
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:55.520]   Speaking of which red box is starting up its Verizon streaming service,
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.600]   to take on Netflix.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:06.160]   Facebook has decided even though it got 88% opposed,
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:10.640]   668,000 votes, they've decided you're not going to get to vote
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:12.800]   because 30 million people didn't weigh in.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.960]   So that's it.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.520]   300 million?
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.480]   Is it a 300 million?
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.040]   Oh, you're right.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:17.840]   It's 300 million.
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.760]   It's got to be a third, right?
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.200]   So democracy is dead on Facebook, of course.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.320]   Whoever thought that was going to even happen.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:29.600]   It was absurd to have the town hall model on Facebook.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.120]   I do however still I've argued this with Google in the past.
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:33.840]   I would argue with Facebook.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:40.080]   And I think there is a role for a kind of council of peers
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:44.480]   as an advisory group that you could even be elected or something.
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:49.360]   When Google's greatest vulnerability to me is that an advertiser can say
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:54.720]   that you hold the power of God over me because Google's main area of monopoly is advertising.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:55.520]   It's not search.
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:56.400]   It's not other areas.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.320]   It is the power there is advertising.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:03.120]   So I would argue that you could have some kind of a court of appeal.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:06.880]   I think Facebook should have councils of users.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:12.480]   But the idea that 30% of all Facebook users would look for anything was absurd on its
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:13.360]   Facebook beginning.
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:18.480]   As I remember it was proposed as a settlement to the FTC.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:20.800]   Well, not as much of the FTC.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:21.920]   I think it was before that.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.600]   I think there was a kind of a protest group before one.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.160]   It changes.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.840]   So it doesn't have legal clout.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.840]   I thought it was something that they had agreed to do.
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.120]   Oh, anyway.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.720]   We'll tell me if I'm wrong.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.240]   Well, obviously it wasn't because they've decided they're not going to do it anymore.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:41.280]   And it wasn't going to happen.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.200]   Yes, someone wrote a piece.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:46.160]   Maybe it was Matthew Ingram who basically said, you know, this is actually a good thing.
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:48.240]   Why should we pretend that this is actually democracy?
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.160]   Like it's better that we just stop pretending anyway.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.240]   I agree with Matthew because it, you know, I mean, come on.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:57.440]   First of all, 30 million people are not going to ever vote anything or 300 million.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:57.840]   Pardon me.
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:01.040]   Anyway, the whole thing was nuts.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:05.200]   So just send me some chocolates from your Facebook account and I'll be happy.
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.360]   This is bad news.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:14.720]   Boy, Jeanie's report did some, somebody did some calculations and figured out that if Google were
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:20.480]   to fiber the entire country, give a gigabit fiber, the stuff they're getting in Kansas City,
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:23.840]   it would cost 140 billion dollars.
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:26.800]   Actually, it was Goldman Sachs that estimated that.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.240]   That's so fast, Buster.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:32.160]   Oh, because then Forbes came back and said, whoa, you know what?
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.360]   That's not so expensive.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.000]   That's not as if Google has to pay that all out of its cash.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.800]   This is a capital investment over a long term.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:41.360]   It's basically like $1,000 per household.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:45.120]   If Goldman Sachs is right, with the return you'd get, it's pretty incredible.
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.840]   And Eric Schmidt did just say that Kansas City is not the end.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:50.320]   Good.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:57.680]   That bulls ambitions will spread past the lovely wheat filled plains of the Midwest.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.240]   And Netflix weighing in saying, in fact, Google fiber is the most because they know,
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:07.520]   because they push a lot of video, is the most consistently fast ISP in America,
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:10.960]   beating even Verizon Fios for that honor.
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:13.760]   So that's good.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:18.000]   If you got fiber from Google, you're watching your movies in high-adiff.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.120]   Someday we'll get that.
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:27.280]   The whole stat about it would cost 140 billion dollars to wire fiber up on the whole country.
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:29.920]   For some reason, that reminds me of the analyst report that said,
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.560]   YouTube must be losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:37.280]   Analysts are taking guests, but they don't really know what the cost structure is,
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:39.040]   what the scale is, all that sort of stuff.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:40.080]   And you're right.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.720]   It's also that you're not looking at the full P&L.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:45.520]   You throw out one big number and say, "Well, that's scary."
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:52.240]   Imagine if we could suddenly all get, I think, of course, it should be fiber.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:58.160]   Imagine if we could all get really good internet access without all the net
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.200]   and quality fights and all that.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.280]   We actually had competition in this sphere.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.640]   How wonderful is that world?
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.200]   And asymmetric.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.880]   So upload is as fast as download.
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.800]   That would enable a lot of interesting things.
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:12.160]   Incredible.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:17.680]   From thoughtcatalog.com, William Hudds and figures out how to hack Chipotle.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.600]   Get more meat in your burrito.
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:26.640]   So this is literally a Chipotle mind trick.
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:30.960]   Twig listeners brought this to my attention.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:33.920]   And this is relevant to your interests.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:37.520]   When they ask you, I have not so many recommendations for this this week.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.240]   When they ask you, black beans or pinot beans, did you know you can say both?
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:44.560]   I had no idea.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.360]   That's crazy.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.800]   That's crazy talk.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:47.840]   Crazy talk.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.840]   Now he does say execution is key.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.320]   If you make your eventual position known from the start,
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.440]   Chipotle is going to turn its back on you.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.160]   So answer the question with one bean.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.440]   Don't tell them both.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.480]   Timing matters.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:02.640]   Wait for the beans to be applied to the burrito.
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:05.920]   Then say, can I have pinot beans too?
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:09.200]   This method ensures two full scoops of both.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.840]   When I say I'll have a little brown rice and a lot of black beans.
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.160]   So I always get double scoops of black beans.
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.320]   Because at my age, of course, I need the fiber.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.560]   I go light on the rice too.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.200]   Now here's another handy one.
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:27.840]   When you're asked what kind of meat, you can say half chicken, half steak.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:33.120]   And the point he makes is, now that sounds like one half plus one half.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.840]   But because a scoop of meat is just a scoop of meat,
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:38.960]   nobody in Chipotle management has introduced half scoops.
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:44.640]   So you can ask for half chicken, half steak,
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.160]   and you'll get more of both.
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:49.840]   Unlike with the beans, you should make your position on the half meats clear from the beginning.
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.040]   Otherwise, they'll charge you for extra meat.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:57.440]   I heard a guy in there last week, because I'm proving that what they're last week,
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.520]   saying that he got charged for triple meat.
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:00.480]   Right.
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:06.160]   If I had this burrito with double beans and double meat, I would pass out.
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:08.080]   But there's more already full.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:08.800]   There's more.
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:12.640]   Ask for fajitas in your burrito, the grilled onions and peppers.
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:13.760]   They're next to the rice.
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.480]   They're right there.
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:18.560]   They don't ask you, but you can say you want them, and they'll know you know.
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:22.400]   You can make two meals off of that.
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:27.040]   It also says, and I think this is the final bit, make an informed decision regarding the guacamole.
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:31.920]   You may be not all three sauces, okay?
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:37.040]   But the guacamole situation requires a real value judgment.
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:41.840]   Basically, you could get two whole avocados at the market for the price of one scoop.
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:46.960]   Consider ordering a burrito bowl and adding your own sliced avocado on top.
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:50.160]   If you forego the meat, the guacamole is free.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.120]   Just a little tip there.
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.440]   Oh, that's a good tip, actually.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:54.880]   I do that.
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:58.080]   Also, Google onion chipotle.
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:03.440]   You'll find the piece from the onion chipotle employee just gave guy in front of you more.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:08.160]   Breaking news and the onions on it.
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:15.200]   And of course, I haven't had lunch some faint with hunger right now.
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:16.080]   So thanks.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:18.480]   Just get guy.
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:23.840]   I loved the onion article that was like Google shuts down Gmail for two hours to display
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:24.720]   its immense power.
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:30.640]   By the way, there were outages of both, wasn't it Gmail and Facebook this week?
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:34.080]   Not long, but enough to cause me some shakes.
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:36.240]   These things happen.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:38.480]   These days, you're just like, oh, it's going to be one of those days.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.880]   I might have to go outside.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:43.440]   Maybe visit a chipotle.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.480]   It is one of those moments though, where you question your life,
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.760]   and you're like, wait a second.
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.520]   I don't have this thing to play with.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.080]   I missed it.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.960]   I missed the Gmail out of Jysau friends of mine, like talking about it.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.880]   And I was like, whoo, good thing.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.160]   I didn't affect me.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:01.360]   Dodge the bullet there.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:04.720]   Taking a point outside.
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:06.560]   Have you guys played ingress at all?
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.480]   I just got it.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.280]   Thanks to Chad.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:13.760]   And he didn't warn me that in fact, you have to get up and walk around.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.960]   Well, I'd like to go to the tapes on that one.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.520]   I'm a little upset.
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:22.960]   What kind of game is this?
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:25.120]   You can't play it if you're sitting at your desk.
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:27.600]   Oh, you got to walk miles and miles.
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.760]   Well, Matt, are you resistance or enlightened?
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:33.200]   I'm resistance because I'm like resistant things.
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:34.160]   Are you enlightened?
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:35.520]   Ah, I'm enlightened.
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:36.400]   I went with enlightened.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:39.920]   So now I'm still in the tutorial because I have to walk around.
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:40.640]   Yeah, I know.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:41.600]   It's crazy.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:45.280]   So the idea is you're collecting this XM stuff.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:50.000]   Or and now I've got to go to a portal.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.160]   Enemy controlled portal.
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:54.880]   But the problem with that is, okay, it sees where I am.
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:56.080]   This is my range.
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:57.920]   The portal, I have to get up and go there.
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:00.880]   I can't just sit here and play the game.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.200]   XM, this stuff will come to you, but the portal won't come to you.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:07.040]   And that's the speakeasy across the street.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:10.160]   I was going to say that that portal is so close to you, Leo.
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.720]   Well, I'm in the middle of a show.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:14.400]   Well, okay. Fair enough.
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.520]   I can't go there.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.240]   So do you think the supportals?
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:18.880]   I think.
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:21.040]   Yeah, just right outside of the 50s.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:21.520]   Nothing.
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:24.080]   Hack, deploy, recharge, upgrade, nothing.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.920]   All I can do is cancel target.
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.720]   But this, I have to say, I don't know why this game.
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:31.680]   This is from Google, right?
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:33.200]   The same people who did field trip.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.240]   Yes.
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:34.800]   Niantic.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:35.120]   Yep.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:35.520]   Niantic.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:37.600]   I don't know why Google is doing this to me.
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:40.320]   Is it because they want me to exercise more?
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:44.720]   I have heard people who said I've lost 10 pounds playing in grass,
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:47.760]   but if you wanted to be cynical, you could say, well,
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:49.520]   people can submit points of interest.
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:52.000]   So these portals are around things that are interesting,
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.360]   like statues or post offices.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.920]   And you actually learn a lot about your town walking around.
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.280]   Like I've been to five or six statues I never would have seen.
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:03.040]   And so, cynically, you could say, well,
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:06.560]   it's Google could gather data or you could submit points of interest.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:10.560]   But like a lot of people have been losing weight or getting more healthy
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:13.360]   playing it, except for the one guy who said he actually got arrested.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:16.560]   Because he was playing at like 2 a.m. at night.
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.200]   And the cops were like, what's this guy doing with his phone open?
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:22.320]   Yeah, it makes a lot of noise while it's going around.
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.160]   It's talking to you and it's making sound.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.880]   Well, I have to take a day off just to play ingress.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:27.840]   Yeah, you do.
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:29.920]   I was talking about this with Kevin Purdy.
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:33.280]   And he was saying that he was reading a Reddit thread
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.760]   where people were saying post offices are very popular place
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:38.080]   for portals to be because they have to be public places.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:40.960]   But you know, you got the guy like standing outside of the post office,
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:43.360]   like taking pictures and like tapping at the phone.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:46.080]   It was starting to get like kind of a hairy eyeball off on the police.
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:47.040]   I want to do this.
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:47.600]   That will walk.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.560]   What's going on?
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.000]   Yeah, this is the, you're going to know,
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.960]   home on security is going to be shutting ingress down.
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:56.480]   So I didn't get an invite.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.840]   So Chad invited me.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.360]   So I'm brand new with this.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:00.560]   Just started this on Sunday.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:02.960]   So what are, or no yesterday?
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.400]   What do I do?
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:09.840]   So I, so I'll choose at some point whether I'm enlightened or resistors.
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:13.200]   And then does that mean anything?
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.000]   It's just two teams.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.200]   Just two factions.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:17.680]   Yeah, blue team and a green team.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:20.560]   And what people recommend is pick the underdog.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.840]   Because, you know, if you're part of the dominant group in your area,
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.920]   you're not going to get as many points and experiences.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:29.280]   Whereas if you're like trying to take down and hack the portals of the,
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.760]   of the over, you know, dogs, then you get more experience and you have more fun with it.
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:39.120]   See, that's, see, when I was born, I asked to be a white male and, uh, yeah.
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:41.040]   Show's the wrong side, Leo.
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.160]   Show's the wrong side, I guess.
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:44.880]   Straight white male.
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:46.720]   Look where it's got me.
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:49.840]   Playing on easy.
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:53.120]   I am.
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:54.240]   I'm playing on easy.
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:55.440]   You guys, you go ahead.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.680]   You do the hard mode.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:00.080]   I'm taking it easy.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.400]   I'm told you I'm not ambitious.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.040]   I'm taking it.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:03.920]   I'm satisfied.
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:05.440]   It's good to be content.
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:06.160]   So title.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.280]   So what you'll do is you'll go hack portals.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:09.600]   Right.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.760]   And then that covers the area.
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:18.160]   So you're, you're claiming area for your side of, of the game and that'll help, you know,
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:19.680]   should I do it at work or home?
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:20.960]   They should know.
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.240]   You're in where it's available.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:23.040]   You're in Manhattan.
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:24.080]   You got to go out the door.
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:25.680]   You can't do it at work or home.
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.320]   You can't.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.120]   You have to walk.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:28.400]   That's what I know.
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:30.880]   But where do I start at home out in the berbs?
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:31.680]   No, it doesn't matter.
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:32.880]   Just where you are, right?
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:34.000]   You can play it home at work.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.960]   Two, I believe it's ingress.com/intell and you can see the portals around you.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:43.680]   So so you can see if there's a place that has more portals, you'd start there.
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:45.680]   I've had Petaluma.
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:46.960]   It's probably a very good place to play.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:50.400]   It's not as good as San Francisco, but.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:50.960]   Big city.
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:53.120]   See, Jeff's got the great opportunity there.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:55.200]   He's going to be here in heaven.
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:55.760]   Now you can't.
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:57.440]   But this intel site is great.
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:58.960]   I have no idea.
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:58:59.520]   Pro tip.
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:00.080]   Pro tip.
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:00.480]   Thanks, Chad.
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:01.120]   No problem.
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:02.080]   It's a king of pro tips.
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:06.880]   There's also a subreddit called ingress and they share some codes that will get you extra
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:09.760]   experience points and resonators and hacking stuff.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:12.720]   So you can tell Chad and I play quite a bit.
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:13.440]   It's awesome.
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:13.760]   Right.
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:16.560]   Actually, in all seriousness, it is an awesome game.
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.560]   It's kind of addictive.
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:23.680]   So you can hear the portals in Petaluma and see these ones have been connected by the enlightened.
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:25.600]   And so this is their area.
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:26.160]   Oh.
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:26.560]   And they've.
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:29.040]   So as resistance, so I'm going to be resistance.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:29.360]   Right.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:31.280]   So can I go in there and break it up?
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:31.840]   Exactly.
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:32.320]   Yes.
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:33.440]   That's what you want to do.
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:38.000]   And so if you were to take this portal here, that would make that would mean they wouldn't
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.360]   have any any.
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:41.360]   The show's over.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:42.080]   I'm out of here.
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:45.120]   Actually, what you really want to do is walk instead of walking to this one that's
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:46.800]   close, just walk over to here to this one.
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:47.840]   That's my old apartment.
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:48.480]   What the hell?
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:50.800]   Because then you would have all of these connected.
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:52.240]   Oh, it's the Petaluma fire department.
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:53.040]   Right.
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:53.360]   Right.
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:55.600]   So I'm going to go over to the Petaluma fire department,
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:58.160]   act suspiciously, take pictures.
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:00.400]   And I'll win the game.
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:01.600]   Hang out there for 20 minutes.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:02.720]   On the way to Guantanamo Bay.
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:03.200]   Yes.
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:03.920]   Yeah.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:07.680]   You don't have to take pictures, but a lot of the points of interest are elementary
[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:09.760]   schools, which feels really, really creepy.
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:10.720]   It's become a movie.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:15.120]   US Post Office fire department, penry park.
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:17.200]   Do it after 5 p.m.
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:20.400]   No, Petaluma historical museum.
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:23.680]   Volpe's grocery, which is a speakeasy.
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:24.240]   Right.
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:27.520]   And so that was in that's what I was seeing.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:32.240]   And that was most likely in a field trip, because it has history.
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:32.560]   Ah.
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:34.160]   He's probably already added to field trip.
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:34.480]   Ah-ha.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:35.040]   Got it.
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:36.640]   So field trip has, there's a nexus.
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:36.960]   Right.
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:41.360]   And so if you even look down here, it looks like there's a point of interest that has been claimed yet.
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:42.880]   This is that that's my house.
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:44.720]   Petaluma wildlife.
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:45.120]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:45.200]   Yeah.
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.160]   That's at the high school.
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:46.560]   Right.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:47.760]   So so that.
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:50.000]   I might get on my bike and play ingress.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:50.320]   Yeah.
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:52.160]   A bike is a great way to play.
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:53.360]   User named chief twit.
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:54.800]   By the way.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:56.880]   And does that matter?
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:58.640]   Can you, is there a social element to this?
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:00.160]   Can I, can I team up with you?
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:00.160]   Yes.
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:00.800]   There is.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:01.120]   Wow.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:02.720]   There's actually chat on each side.
[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:05.840]   And so you can arrange to like mount a massive attack.
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:09.040]   You know, if there's some high level portal that you couldn't hack by yourself,
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:11.440]   you can get a group of people to attack it.
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:15.120]   This might be the most interesting massively multiplayer online game I've ever seen.
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:15.680]   Yeah.
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:18.800]   And just as a, as a thing, I just want everyone to know on Twitter,
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:20.800]   I have no invites left.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:22.640]   Unfortunately, you can see that right there.
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:26.400]   You can try to hit me up on Twitter, but no invites left.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:26.720]   Sorry.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:28.560]   We said we need.
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:30.000]   I don't have any invites either.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:30.400]   Yeah.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:31.440]   Because you start with zero.
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:33.680]   I would love to see what the Mountain View map looks like.
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:34.720]   Have you played Jeff?
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:35.120]   Oh.
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:37.200]   No, I, because I got to get, I got same things.
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:40.000]   You Leo, I got to get the time and go out and, and do it.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.680]   Ingress.com, you, you sign up for a, are they setting out invites now pretty clear?
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:45.680]   Yeah.
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:46.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:46.640]   Okay.
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:47.040]   Yeah.
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:50.000]   So it might take a couple of weeks to get an invite, but Jeff to your point,
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.440]   Mountain View is crazy.
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:56.400]   It's like, full on, you know, the, the portals change sides two or three times an hour.
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:56.400]   Wow.
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:56.960]   Kind of thing.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:57.680]   It's, it's pretty nuts.
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:01:59.600]   Well, there's 28 million enlightened.
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:00.800]   Is that people?
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:03.200]   24 million resistance.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.720]   Nine units.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:05.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:08.640]   But that means they're 52 million mind units playing this game?
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:09.680]   No, no.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.840]   So whenever you draw one of those triangles,
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:14.320]   that's covering a number of houses.
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:16.960]   And so a mind unit is roughly like a residential.
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:17.360]   I see.
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.040]   So these are the people we've taken over.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:22.880]   Yeah. It's, it's, it's a lot like risk, except in the real world.
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:23.840]   It's, it's a lot of fun.
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.840]   Oh, it's freaking awesome.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.160]   Wow.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:29.840]   You can see right for the Google Plex.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.680]   The Google Plex is a hot bed of activity.
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:32.160]   Look at that.
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:32.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.480]   How about how they get anything done?
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.280]   It's my 20%.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:37.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:38.160]   Yeah.
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.760]   It's going to holidays have started.
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.000]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.200]   I'm going to be working on my 20% today.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:48.800]   You can tell which, which Google, um, you know, side is resistance or enlightened by
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:50.400]   which building nodes.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:50.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:53.840]   So Matt is not, tell me about Niantic.
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.840]   These, this was this an acquisition at Google?
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:01.760]   No, it's, it's John Henke and Michael and like a whole bunch of people who had done
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:04.640]   sort of Google Earth and, and Geo sort of stuff.
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:08.320]   And I think it was one of these things where they were thinking about leaving Google
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:11.760]   and instead Google said, well, why don't you make a company inside of Google?
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:18.400]   And so I think Niantic refers to the name of a ship that actually is underground in San Francisco.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:23.200]   And the idea is all around you, there's all kinds of interesting history and things to discover
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.080]   that you might not know.
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.200]   And so Field Trip is one of those things that helps you find things near you.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.960]   And then this is another fun game that helps you discover stuff near you.
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:33.280]   And then you can also submit potential portals.
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:38.160]   There's also a, uh, an alternate reality game that sort of got all these conspiracy
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:39.120]   undertones to it.
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:42.160]   So you can get in at whatever level you're interested in enjoying it.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:43.680]   That's the Niantic project.
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:51.520]   Niantic project.com or Twitter.com/NianticProject, a slowly given information.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:57.760]   I would, this was when I was been worried about all along is that some, at some point I would
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:02.960]   be subsumed by some highly compulsive technology.
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:05.920]   Like the internet.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:07.200]   Like the internet.
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:12.000]   And I've avoided it up to now through podcasting and other distractions.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.280]   Joey Edo, Joey Edo was, I mean, the man is now heading the MIT media lab, but for like
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:18.880]   two world of Warcraft, like we lost him.
[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:20.480]   He did nothing to play a world of Warcraft.
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.840]   We lost him to world of Warcraft.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:22.800]   Okay.
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:25.120]   We didn't mention Habermas, but here's your Gutenberg moment.
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:26.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, a visualization.
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:29.360]   Oh, first of sponsor message.
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:30.240]   Let's just skip that.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:31.680]   Nah, you know, it's not that good.
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:36.960]   It's not that good.
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:37.520]   You know what's better?
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:38.080]   You know what's better, Leo?
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:38.080]   What?
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.040]   You want to take one minute?
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:39.360]   Yeah.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.480]   Go back up to the bottom of the Google section, the punch card thing.
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:43.520]   Have you seen that?
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:43.600]   No.
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:48.080]   What Google would have been in 1960, the man's man.
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:51.360]   It's wonderful.
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:52.640]   It really is brilliantly done.
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:55.760]   And you just get started and get the idea.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:59.840]   I started watching a new BBC, a show called The Hour.
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:02.240]   That's about the BBC in 1956.
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:04.560]   It's kind of a British madman.
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:05.360]   It's quite good.
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:07.120]   It's an interface to current search.
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:08.880]   You can search for the port.
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:09.280]   Let's say.
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:10.080]   Oh, well, let me--
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:10.560]   Okay.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:12.080]   So it's with the punch cards.
[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:15.200]   It's like Fortran all over again.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.200]   Yeah.
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:21.040]   Anybody of a certain age is going to really kind of be scary.
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:24.080]   Oh my God.
[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:25.040]   There's the teletype.
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:25.120]   Is this right?
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:29.680]   Oh my God.
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:31.200]   This is the best part.
[02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:36.800]   This is how it was.
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:37.600]   I hate to tell you.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:41.920]   It's showing an impact printer all along.
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:44.320]   It does a ASCII of Google.
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:45.200]   That's a teletype.
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:46.240]   That's a diagram of Google.
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:47.840]   And then it makes you make a choice and tell it.
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:48.800]   I misspelled my name.
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:49.760]   Oh, did I?
[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:50.960]   Oh, jeez.
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:52.240]   Let me--
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:53.840]   I'm also switching the show.
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:54.800]   Oh, oh, that.
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:55.120]   Okay.
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:56.560]   Well, if you're going to use the punch cards--
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:59.440]   Let's see if 1960 Google asks you, did you mean?
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:03.680]   You know, that's actually accurate because with punch cards,
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:04.720]   you make one mistake.
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:06.080]   The whole job is ruined.
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:07.040]   Right.
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:07.280]   Right.
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:09.760]   So in a way, that's actually very accurate.
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:10.720]   And so it does that.
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.000]   It goes to the teletype and then it goes to a tape drive.
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.560]   And it's very funny, but it's really, very weird.
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.920]   He's got the lights on the front.
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:20.400]   That's what they sound like.
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:21.360]   This is real.
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:22.800]   This is exactly--
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:24.560]   And when Bill Gates started programming,
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:26.320]   this is how he was programming.
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:28.320]   With a time-share computer with a teletype.
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:31.280]   Wow.
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:34.000]   Reading for channel 4 device card reader.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.440]   And it was this fast, by the way.
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:36.320]   No.
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:39.120]   So I could do an image search.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:40.080]   That's got to be a hoot.
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:44.320]   What's that going to look like?
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:46.240]   Is it ASCII art?
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:46.880]   Oh, my God.
[02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:47.040]   Oh, no.
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:48.160]   I guess so.
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:48.880]   Now we have value.
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:49.680]   We have a tape drive.
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:52.320]   Now, this is "Q Morphism" put to a good purpose.
[02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:53.040]   Yes.
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:54.240]   Wow.
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:55.920]   Have you seen this map?
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.080]   Yes.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:59.840]   Have you guys seen the Google postcard?
[02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:01.040]   That's also kind of fun.
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.280]   Where they mail you a postcard with the search results.
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:07.360]   I'll paste it into the chat, but it's basically like
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:11.600]   if Google were a postcard where you write what you wanted
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:13.840]   and then send the postcard off and 30 days later,
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:15.440]   we'll send you back an answer and answer.
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:20.320]   This is MassWorkMASSW-E-R-K dot A-T
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:23.680]   to the gazostria slash Google 6-0.
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:24.240]   [
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:27.200]   [
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:27.200]   ]
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:27.360]   Wow.
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:29.760]   And it's going to do an image plot.
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:30.160]   It is.
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:31.200]   It's ASCII art.
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:31.840]   Yeah, ASCII art.
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:34.560]   Holy komolie.
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:38.400]   That is a hoot and a holler.
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:42.880]   [
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:44.000]   ]
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.160]   So this is somebody else, but that's good.
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:47.520]   I'm glad to know I wasn't the father.
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:49.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, we take a break.
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:52.000]   Come back in just a minute with our tip tool
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.760]   and number of the week, then we'll wrap this thing up.
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:54.800]   Trangulation's coming up.
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.880]   Our guest today on Trangulation is...
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:57.200]   [
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:58.080]   ]
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:07:58.080]   Guy Kawasaki.
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:07:59.120]   Guy Kawasaki.
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:00.480]   He's got a new book out.
[02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:02.000]   Former Apple evangelist.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.920]   And let's hope he's patient,
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:06.000]   because we're running late as always.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.560]   Our show today brought you by Squarespace,
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.560]   the best web hosting out there.
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.560]   I'm telling you,
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:15.440]   not just good hosting,
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:17.280]   great content management system.
[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:20.160]   They're tightly integrated,
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:22.480]   which means you get the best of both worlds.
[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:24.160]   Hosting that doesn't go down,
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:26.640]   software that's always kept up to date and secure.
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:28.320]   You never have to worry about updating it.
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:30.080]   And they've done features.
[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:31.200]   They've done things that...
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:33.600]   The other guys only dream of mobile responsive design
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:35.600]   on all sites on Squarespace now.
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:37.520]   So that means when you design a site
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:38.560]   and you use the great templates,
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:40.640]   you don't have to know anything about what that means.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:42.400]   If you do, by the way,
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:45.280]   no JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, all that,
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:47.920]   they've got a developer platform that's fantastic
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:51.840]   with CUT code coloring, syntax and all that stuff.
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:52.800]   But even if you don't,
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:53.840]   you just drag and drop,
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:54.640]   you take the template,
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.520]   you customize it.
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:57.360]   And automatically,
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:58.880]   as part of the package,
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:00.080]   that site's going to look great.
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:01.280]   There's no mobile version.
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:03.280]   It's all going to work great
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:04.800]   on any size screen
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:06.720]   from 3.5 inches to 27 inches
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:07.920]   and everywhere in between.
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.280]   And when you post you automatically,
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:10.880]   automatically resize all the different...
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:12.560]   You get seven different image sizes,
[02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:14.240]   so they'll use the right image.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:14.960]   They do the whole thing.
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:15.520]   It's beautiful.
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:16.160]   They flow it.
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:18.960]   It's really good if you're artistic.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:21.520]   If you have a aesthetic,
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.480]   a port photographer,
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:25.600]   a designer or an architect,
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.840]   and you want a site that reflects your aesthetic,
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.760]   you get these great templates,
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:31.280]   you make the site look your own.
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:34.080]   And it's really good for images and all of this stuff.
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:35.920]   I really like Squarespace.
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:36.640]   I know you will too,
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:38.800]   and the best part is you can try this free
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:41.360]   for two weeks if you go to squarespace.com.
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:43.760]   And just click the Get Started button
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:45.120]   and they'll walk you through the process.
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:47.360]   You can import all of your existing content
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:48.880]   if you have a site already.
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:50.560]   Supports the major APIs,
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.160]   Blogger, Typepad, Moveable, Type.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:55.040]   If you decide after looking at all of this,
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:56.240]   that, "Yeah, I like this,"
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:58.400]   go to the pricing section,
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:00.160]   your mind will be blown.
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:02.640]   Two weeks free, 27, 47,
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:03.520]   sport and everything.
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:04.800]   But they only have two plans now.
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:05.920]   They've really simplified this.
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.040]   There's the $8 a month
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:08.640]   and the $16 a month
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:10.160]   in both cases when you pay annually.
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:13.760]   Don't even forget the eight.
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:14.640]   I mean, I guess, you know,
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:15.680]   if it's just a simple site
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:16.560]   and you just want to, you know,
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:17.760]   something quick and...
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.920]   But look what you get for 16 bucks a month.
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:22.320]   Unlimited pages, unlimited galleries.
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.680]   If you're a photographer,
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:24.080]   that's great.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:25.360]   Each client can have their own gallery,
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:26.240]   unlimited blogs,
[02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:27.680]   unlimited bandwidth.
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:29.440]   You don't have to ever worry about suddenly
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:32.080]   getting popular and getting a bandwidth bill.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:32.400]   Never.
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:34.640]   16 bucks a month, that's it.
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:35.840]   Unlimited storage,
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:38.000]   unlimited contributors.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.200]   When you buy an annual plan,
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:41.040]   they'll automatically give you a custom...
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:42.480]   Don't you choose the custom domain.
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:44.080]   They'll register it for you for free
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.600]   and hook it up to the Squarespace site.
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:47.920]   Lots of great features.
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:49.040]   I want you to try it today.
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:50.240]   And when you buy,
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:51.040]   do me a favor.
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:53.120]   Use the offer code TWIG12.
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:54.400]   They'll know you heard it on TWIG
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:56.160]   and you'll get 10% off as a thank you.
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:58.720]   10% off your first purchase with new accounts
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:03.360]   when you use the offer code TWIG12.
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:05.200]   Ah, Google Dash Clap.
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:06.720]   By the way, thank you Squarespace.
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:09.680]   You always tell when it's not Squarespace site
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:11.040]   because we bring it to its knees.
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:15.440]   Let's see if we can bring google dash classic dot com.
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:17.040]   Is this the postcard?
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:18.000]   This is the postcard.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.080]   That's hysterical.
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:23.520]   Please allow 30 days.
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:30.640]   I like how each character gets its own.
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:31.280]   That's great.
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:32.080]   Yeah, it's own little...
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:33.040]   Space.
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:34.640]   ...actually did the search though.
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:37.600]   There was one that was like medieval Google
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.320]   or something like that.
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:39.360]   I couldn't find that at a time.
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:41.280]   What death?
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:43.040]   What don't thou seek or something?
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:48.400]   YTMND medieval Google.
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.080]   I don't know if this is it.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.080]   Yeah.
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.480]   Webby portraits,
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:11:59.200]   guilds,
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:00.160]   cryer kingdom,
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:01.760]   thine query.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.400]   High thee hence,
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:08.240]   feelest thou fortunate?
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:10.800]   It's on burn lap.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:13.760]   All right, time for our tool of...
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:16.160]   I mean, sorry, the tip of the week from Gina Trappani.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:19.760]   Well, I have to thank Yoshioni in the chat room for this one.
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:20.480]   I actually missed this.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.000]   It should have been in the changelog,
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.840]   but I just got released today.
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:25.680]   I think Google Currents for Android
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:27.600]   got a pretty big update.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:28.560]   So, I'm not for iOS yet.
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:29.360]   It's just Android.
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:33.680]   Makes it easier to scan headlines and get breaking news
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:36.720]   and kind of groups publications into different categories.
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:38.720]   So, Currents is the kind of flip board like
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:42.560]   tablet app for reading blogs and online magazines.
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:45.120]   So, it looks like a pretty nice update.
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:47.600]   Leo, you're a flip board guy, right?
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:48.560]   Yeah, I love flip board.
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:50.080]   But I like Currents a lot too.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:52.560]   And I'm glad to see the competition.
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.200]   Oh, I have a lot of...
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:55.200]   Google News also got a big upgrade.
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:58.320]   If you just go to the web page on an Android device for Google News,
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:12:59.440]   it's much nicer as well.
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:00.080]   Oh, good.
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:01.120]   Cool.
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:02.160]   That's good.
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:07.280]   Because I want to see news and Currents kept up to date and so forth.
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.240]   I mean, I think Google Plus scares me that it's going to take over all Google interfaces.
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:13.360]   So, that's nice.
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:15.760]   Why, shoppers being updated, Google Earths being updated,
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:16.880]   Google Drives being updated.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.880]   That's probably the save you were talking about.
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:21.520]   And the Google Currents field trip is being updated.
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.760]   So, lots of updates.
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:25.760]   I just got all of a sudden.
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:26.880]   I'm going to buy it, Leo.
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:28.320]   The what? The note?
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.200]   Yeah.
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.960]   Pretty sweet.
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:32.320]   It is sweet.
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:34.480]   I'm liking my X is 4.
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:36.240]   But I don't know.
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:37.120]   It's pretty sweet.
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:39.040]   It's ginormous.
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:43.520]   I was walking around talking on it yesterday and they were mocking me.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:44.960]   Yes, it doesn't look weird.
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:45.280]   Hello.
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:46.560]   What?
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:48.240]   That doesn't look weird.
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:48.640]   Hello.
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:49.280]   Yes.
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:50.400]   I'm on the phone right now.
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:51.680]   Does that look weird?
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:52.640]   I don't think that looks...
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:54.480]   It does have a bit of Fisher price about it.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:57.360]   Maybe I'm just used to it.
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.960]   I don't talk on the phone that much, but...
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:02.560]   From the side angle, it might look a little large.
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:03.600]   But from there...
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:05.920]   That's what she's saying.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.760]   There's a tablet stuck to my face.
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:11.360]   I like my note too.
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:12.080]   I really do.
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:13.760]   I really, really do.
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:17.200]   Okay.
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:18.800]   So I'm updating current.
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:19.440]   Actually, I could show you.
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:20.320]   I think you got updated.
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:22.240]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:22.480]   Cool.
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:22.640]   Yeah.
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:23.760]   I was going to ask a few comments.
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:23.840]   Currents.
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.080]   Yeah.
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:25.280]   Just got updated.
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:27.200]   So let's see what the...
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:28.720]   Oh, I have to hold it way over here now.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:30.160]   I have to do the stretch.
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:31.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:32.400]   It's very different.
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:35.280]   Whole new look to currents.
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:37.520]   So yeah, it's not quite flip board,
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:38.560]   but I think it looks good.
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:40.560]   I like it a lot.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.520]   You know what I miss?
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:42.080]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:42.720]   Oh, it's got...
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:43.600]   You know what it's looking like?
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:45.360]   Google now a little bit.
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:47.600]   It's got a little bit of a now card.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:49.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:53.520]   Oh, oh, it's got that Google+ slide up thing on the bottom now.
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:59.600]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, I like it.
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:00.560]   I like it.
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:01.200]   That's good.
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:02.960]   That's good.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:05.200]   I forgot to mention that Google's got $10 billion.
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:05.840]   It's $10 billion.
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:08.400]   But we don't need to mention that anymore.
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.600]   Yeah.
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.760]   This is good.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:13.760]   Can I share it now?
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:14.320]   See the...
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.840]   One of the things I do is I share it.
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:19.520]   It's got all the sharing things.
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:20.880]   Yeah.
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:22.400]   That's cool.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:24.720]   It's one of the things that really makes Android special.
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:26.320]   Wow, you're a share menu.
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:26.880]   You can have...
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:27.840]   Oh, luminous.
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:30.480]   You can share it anywhere.
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:31.280]   Good God.
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:31.920]   Look at that.
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:34.160]   That is impressive.
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:35.920]   It's as big as my phone, baby.
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:39.520]   Your phone isn't even big enough to accommodate it.
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.960]   No, it's dynamic.
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:42.400]   But that's what I love about it.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:44.080]   I love that.
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:44.640]   That's...
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:45.920]   You know, iPhone doesn't do that.
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:46.960]   It's Facebook or Twitter.
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:48.720]   Here you are, the God of oversharing.
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:52.080]   Roger Cohen in the New York Times had a column going against oversharing,
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:55.600]   how often the wise, you know, and he had this tweet that he said,
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:58.320]   "I just happened upon this tweet by this woman named whatever,
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:15:59.600]   that I had this volcanic zit."
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:01.360]   And I thought, "Pwah, that sounds very,
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:02.000]   that sounds very, that sounds very..."
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.360]   I went looking on Twitter for the tweet.
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:03.840]   Couldn't find it.
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:04.240]   Went around.
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:06.720]   I realized I quoted it in my book.
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:07.280]   Oh boy.
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:09.280]   Years ago.
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:12.320]   The Times just had to put a correction about it,
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:15.200]   because that's the latest tweet he could find that was awful.
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:19.600]   But you, Leo, you are his poster boy overshare.
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:20.800]   Overshare.
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:21.360]   I like this.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:22.800]   You know what I'm going to use this.
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:23.840]   I like the new...
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:25.200]   The redesign is fantastic.
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:27.920]   Really, really, really nice.
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:29.200]   Yeah, and so easy to read.
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:32.160]   Yeah, congratulations to Loik, by the way,
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:33.440]   the Loib conference was...
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:35.920]   He's been trying to sell it for years.
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:37.840]   He finally found a sucker to buy it.
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:38.800]   Oh, he did?
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:39.760]   Who bought it?
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:40.480]   Read Mydom.
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:42.000]   They do...
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.280]   They're a big conference organizer.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.640]   They don't do any tech conferences.
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:45.920]   This will be their first tech conference.
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:46.960]   They do a music conference,
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:48.640]   and they get television conference.
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:51.520]   And they bought a majority stake,
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:54.080]   but Loik and Geraldine will still be doing the show.
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:55.040]   It's actually one of the best.
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:56.400]   It's a wonder.
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:57.360]   Have you ever done it with Loib?
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:58.000]   That's just...
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:58.880]   I wish I could.
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:16:59.840]   It's about timing for me.
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:01.360]   It's my graduation...
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:02.320]   It's pre-breakable.
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:04.720]   It's London, and it's Paris, and it's just the best.
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:06.320]   We didn't go this year, and I'm sad.
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:08.320]   I love it.
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:08.960]   Great event.
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:10.320]   So congratulations, Loik.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:10.720]   That's great.
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:13.360]   Do you have a number for us, Mr. G?
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:14.400]   Yeah, I do, real quick.
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:18.080]   Removal requests to Google are up 10x
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:21.760]   in six months to 2.5 million per week.
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:26.160]   And by the way, removes 97.5% of them.
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:28.560]   And guesses as to why,
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:30.320]   but one guess is just a lot more...
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.880]   The interface to submit them was made easier.
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.400]   Thank you very much, Google.
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:40.720]   And that there are more routines to try to find
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:43.040]   allegedly offending content online.
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:45.200]   And you get this from the Google Transparency Report,
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:46.480]   which is cool that they actually...
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.600]   They publish this information.
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:48.080]   This was that?
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:48.800]   Yeah, I think so right.
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:49.040]   Yeah.
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:52.400]   But they're not all DMCA.
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:53.280]   No, they're not all.
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:54.560]   A lot of them are.
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:57.040]   And you can see the different organizations
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.200]   that are asking for it.
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:00.800]   Top copyright owners in the past month,
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:02.560]   top domains specified.
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:03.760]   Most of them are torrent sites,
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:06.000]   in fact, at least in the top five are torrent sites.
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.680]   So probably a lot of them are.
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:10.560]   But look at that graph.
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:14.480]   This is 2012, 2011.
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:16.080]   Jeeh.
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:17.120]   Just jumped...
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:19.280]   per week.
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:20.640]   That's the per week requests.
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:23.680]   Go ahead.
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:26.240]   I have a community on Google+
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:27.120]   since there now.
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:28.320]   Is for Twig?
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:29.440]   Why did you guys yell?
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:30.240]   Good.
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:31.200]   Oh, cool.
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:34.400]   So, I guess you could search for communities.
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:35.920]   So search for Twig in communities.
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:37.200]   Oh, there it is.
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:39.440]   Look, preview community.
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:40.000]   That's cool.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.680]   That's nice.
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:47.440]   My tool was going to be ingress.
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:49.760]   But I already showed it.
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:50.400]   So...
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:51.200]   Sorry.
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:53.440]   No, no, I'm thrilled.
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:55.040]   I got some pro tips.
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:55.760]   That's important.
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:00.240]   And I'm about to walk out the door and go take over the post office.
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:01.600]   See, you say things like that,
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:03.280]   and I think the government gets upset.
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:04.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:05.920]   It's just out of context.
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:06.480]   Yeah.
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:06.960]   Don't...
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.960]   The post office needs somebody who cares about it.
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:10.640]   I'm not going...
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:13.680]   I'm just going to take my cell phone and tap a few keys.
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:15.680]   And then it'll be mine.
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.360]   Now, that didn't come out right.
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:17.840]   Right.
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:19.680]   I think the government would say, Leo, you're welcome to it.
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:21.040]   Please.
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:21.920]   I think my...
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:22.400]   I'm going to...
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:24.400]   I think the government would say you stamped...
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:25.920]   I want to take it for the resistance.
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:29.200]   See, all of this is just asking for trouble.
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:33.280]   And you know that the NSA is running an automated filter on this podcast,
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:35.440]   and that as soon as they hear this, I'm...
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:38.240]   If I disappear, you'll know why.
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:40.400]   You're not there with a phone clear, because it's too big.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:42.240]   It must be some strange new trifle.
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:43.120]   Well, exactly.
[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:43.680]   You want to show...
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:44.640]   You want to flash this?
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:45.920]   You're in trouble.
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:47.360]   You're in trouble.
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:49.520]   Well, at least people aren't using words like bomb making...
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:50.400]   Hey, stop it!
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:50.880]   Stop it!
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:51.600]   Stop it!
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:52.560]   You're better than Thomas.
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:53.440]   Oh, sorry, sorry.
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:53.920]   Sorry.
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:55.520]   She's...
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:01.120]   There was one guy in the Usenet days,
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:04.400]   who his email signature was like every keyword he could think of.
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:04.800]   I remember that.
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:05.360]   Yeah.
[02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:06.560]   That my trigger things.
[02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:08.320]   He was trying to get echelon to...
[02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:10.320]   By the way, whatever happened to that guy?
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:13.120]   He had no ear for me, that was actually...
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:14.160]   Yeah, I kind of disappeared.
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:17.840]   Got very quiet all of a sudden.
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:23.360]   And Matt also has a tip.
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:25.120]   Oh, Matt, Matt cuts.
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:26.720]   A tip from the Googleplex.
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:28.320]   Sure.
[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:30.000]   So this actually came out this morning.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.360]   You know, we have a free thing at google.com/webmasters
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:36.480]   that lets you get all kinds of great information from Google.
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:39.680]   But there hasn't been that much of a way to give information to Google.
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:44.480]   You could mark things up and do all the HTML and all that sort of stuff,
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:46.640]   XML, but that's kind of a hassle.
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:49.920]   So we just launched something that we announced on the Google Webmaster blog
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:52.800]   called the data highlighter.
[02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:56.080]   And so instead of making the markup and editing your HTML,
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:56.960]   you can go to here.
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:59.600]   Right now it's for events, so things like concerts.
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:02.640]   But you basically can highlight something and say, okay, this is the name.
[02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:03.360]   You can highlight it.
[02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:04.320]   This is what the data is.
[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:04.720]   Wow.
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:07.120]   Google will learn the structure of that page.
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:07.680]   Oh my god.
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:10.240]   All the other stuff on your page, on your site.
[02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:13.680]   And then we'll possibly be able to highlight that in the search results.
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:14.240]   Brilliant.
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:15.120]   Oh, cool.
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:16.880]   Semantic web.
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.720]   You tell Google.
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:20.880]   Without all the hassle.
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:22.400]   That's really great.
[02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:25.760]   By the way, Matt does some great on the Webmaster's tools.
[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:28.080]   It does great videos that everybody should be watching.
[02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:31.040]   Just really love your stuff, Matt.
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:35.200]   You're very helpful to everybody who wants to show up well in Google.
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:38.160]   Are you demonstrating something, Chad there?
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:40.160]   This is just the video that was on the--
[02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:40.640]   There you go.
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:41.840]   There's Matt cuts.
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:42.720]   Right.
[02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:47.760]   It's absolutely my--
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:48.080]   Jack.
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:49.280]   He's like two offices down.
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:50.400]   Jack has Jack.
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:50.880]   It's all.
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:51.120]   Yeah.
[02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:52.960]   Hey, thanks everybody.
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:54.160]   That's so much fun to do the show.
[02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:58.080]   Thanks to Lamar Wilson who joins us at the beginning to talk about YouTube, Matt cuts,
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:22:00.560]   who is the guy who keeps spam off our web results.
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:00.960]   And we've done--
[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:01.920]   You love your Matt.
[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:03.520]   We love Matt on the show.
[02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:04.160]   Yeah, thank you, Matt.
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:05.520]   He's one of us.
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:06.720]   That's why we love him so much.
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:08.160]   Oh, it's good to see you.
[02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:09.920]   He's a first-class person.
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:10.320]   You're not.
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:11.280]   You're resistance, right?
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:12.800]   First-class object.
[02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:13.440]   It's wig.
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:13.760]   All right.
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:14.800]   Resistance.
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:16.160]   For the horde.
[02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:17.600]   Also.
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:20.080]   Also, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:23.360]   Who is about to-- what's the opposite matriculate?
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:24.000]   Commenceulate?
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:25.600]   I don't know.
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:26.960]   He's going to walk in the commencement.
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:27.600]   Ridiculous.
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:28.560]   Those guys are such a huge guy.
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:29.680]   Oh, it looks good.
[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:30.400]   No, it looks good.
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:33.280]   You look like the professor on those videotapes.
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:34.160]   Video professor.
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:36.720]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:38.160]   Professor--
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:42.000]   Special effect on the tenured professor of journalism at the City
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:42.880]   University of New York.
[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:44.320]   Actually, are you?
[02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:45.440]   I am.
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:46.080]   Full professor.
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:47.520]   It can rid of me.
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:47.920]   He's the man.
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:48.480]   Oh, oh.
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:49.680]   Cannot be fired.
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:50.880]   He also blogs a buzz machine.
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:53.120]   Could think because he blogs a buzz machine.com.
[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:55.200]   And his book latest is Public Parts.
[02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:56.000]   A must read.
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.520]   Fabio.
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:00.400]   And of course, the wonderful Gina Trapani.
[02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:01.840]   Mother of Etta.
[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:04.560]   The role is all.
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:04.800]   Yes.
[02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:05.920]   All you need to know.
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:06.560]   Yeah.
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:06.960]   Yeah.
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.560]   That does seem to be my prime meeting.
[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:09.040]   It does.
[02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:11.840]   It changes your identity completely to have a kid.
[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:12.400]   It does.
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:13.440]   It really does.
[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:16.400]   You didn't see it, but Henry walked in during the show
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:18.800]   and I actually wandered off because I had to
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:19.600]   give him stuff.
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:22.400]   Because today was supposed to be his driving test,
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:24.240]   but he didn't have the insurance card for the car.
[02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:27.200]   And you guys were handling the conversation just fine,
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:28.080]   so I just took off.
[02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:30.320]   You're good, Leo.
[02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:31.680]   That's the priority.
[02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:32.400]   Your kids.
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:33.520]   Yep.
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:33.920]   Yep.
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:37.440]   Chad's worried for silence, but then again,
[02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:38.880]   not we never have silence with this group.
[02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:40.320]   Well, that's the thing I knew.
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:42.400]   It was during the Flickr conversation,
[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:44.000]   and I figured you had more than enough.
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:44.320]   Yeah.
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:46.240]   I was ready to just play the Trange Log video
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:48.000]   and hope Gina just took it after that.
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:49.680]   Absolutely.
[02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:50.400]   Absolutely.
[02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:51.360]   I'm sorry to do.
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:53.040]   I've taken this is actually a bad sign.
[02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:55.120]   I've taken the wandering off during the show a lot.
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:59.920]   But now that I have Ingress, I have an excuse anyway.
[02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:01.360]   Yeah, you got to get the next one.
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:02.160]   Yeah.
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:03.200]   There's some XM out there.
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:04.640]   Thank you, everybody.
