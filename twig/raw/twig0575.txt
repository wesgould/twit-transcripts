[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is here, Ant Pruitt. Stacey Higgin-Botham.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.080]   We will talk about Google's ad market. It's 10 times bigger than the stock market, but
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.440]   completely unregulated. Should it continue to be? We will also talk about the Fediverse
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.680]   having some problems in Android, the Google change log, and then a very, very moving farewell
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.920]   to Chadwick Boseman from a guy who knew him pretty well. That's all next on Twig.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.680]   This week in Google has brought to you from Twig's last past studios. Securing every

[00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:03.000]   the show we cover the latest news from Google, and parts around there. And that's it. And
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.960]   Pruitt, he is coming to us from his house in beautiful Northern California. Hello, Anthony.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.960]   Good to see you.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.960]   Hello, Mr. Le Porte.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   You're in the squad.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.600]   You're doing good. You're in the barn today, I could tell.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   I could tell you.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   That's good.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   With purple walls.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.800]   Purple barn. It's nice. Everybody out of have a purple barn. Also, Jeff Jarvis, visiting
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.820]   us from New Jersey. He is, of course, the Leonard Town. I mean, I'm getting it. The
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.960]   Leonard Town Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   at the City University of New York. He's also a blogger at buzzmachine.com, prolific writer,
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.080]   and all about man about town.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.520]   Prolific. Do you think I say too much? Do you think I write too much? You got a problem
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   with that?
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.400]   I said prolific, not prolix. There's a difference as Stacey Higginbotham well knows. She's my
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.360]   editor, red pencil in hand, Stacey on IOT.com. Now we have to warn everyone, Stacey is doing
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.120]   some home improvements right now.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.920]   Through the gentler of the saw and the kachunk of the nail gun.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.360]   That's good. Stacey has her tool belt on.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.920]   Yeah. It's good. She's getting her windows done. I am going to have my 1969 windows replaced.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.520]   Oh, yeah. It's good to do that.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   It was time.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.840]   We did a little while ago in our house. You get the double painted, insulated things and
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   all that.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.640]   Exactly. Soon you won't hear everything. I know. I'm going on mute.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.680]   No, no, no, no. Please. We love it. It's like home and prayer.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.400]   Your joy is the real life of it.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.800]   Yeah, I love it. No, that's good. It was weird talking about that in the early days of
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.080]   COVID, who said, "I'll let your dog, I'll let anybody see your dog in your Zoom calls."
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.880]   It's like by now everybody's saying, "You have a dog. You got a cat. You got a mouse.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.880]   Hamster snake."
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   They're looking for it.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.360]   Anything to relieve this boredom?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.120]   Yeah, anything.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   We're when?
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.000]   I'm on Zoom today from 9 a.m. until whenever we end.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.680]   It'll be 730-ish.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.560]   All day on Zoom?
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.440]   All day. Is that your office hours now?
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.360]   No, I just had a... Well, I had two meetings, then I had an event, and then I had class right
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.640]   before this, then I have this wonderful moment.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.480]   So by the way, I'm going to tell you something. I woke up this morning, which I do, and I
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.240]   pull up the rundown. I do my work right as soon as I get up.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240]   Thank you.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.240]   Thank you.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.040]   And I looked at it and I said, "I don't want to be on this show."
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.800]   Yeah, I know what you mean.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.160]   It was like this week in content moderation.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.800]   So I went a little crazy. I added a lot of stuff.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   Fantastic.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.320]   I found lots of things other than, "Oh, Facebook left up a poster. Google took down a post.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   Bored me silly."
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.680]   And by the way, those stories have been important to Mr. Jones.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.400]   But wait a minute, those stories have been in my rundowns for the last two weeks. You
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.600]   notice, I haven't been doing those stories.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.800]   Yes, I know, but there was something else that I thought I'd be doing.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.680]   I get sub-word by that.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.800]   I took it over. I took it over. I even added a new category. You notice that?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.400]   Well, I didn't catch that.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.000]   There's a new green category on it.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   TikTok?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.200]   Right above the note, right?
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   Security.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   He loves us.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   He loves us.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   Moral Panic.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.800]   There's moral panic over misinformation. Moral panic against cats. Moral panic over QAnon.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.560]   Moral panic over screen time. And then sex and social media, a new book about moral panic
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.160]   regarding sex online. And we, my friends, will cover those topics.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160]   I took it over.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   I took it over.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.160]   I took it over.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   And Google.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   And then...
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.360]   The person was going to have us just be depressed today.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.360]   Don't blame...
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.880]   Don't blame Carson because I bookmark those two and they're probably all stuff I bookmarked
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.880]   as well.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.360]   I bookmark them, but doesn't mean we have to talk about them.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   I'm just warning.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.360]   I'm just warning them.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.760]   Did you see that Herman Cain tweeted?
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.760]   That's amazing.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.880]   That gave me some levity during some dark times.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   Oh man.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.920]   Gotta cut those burritos out.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.640]   So what's weird is he tweeted an Andy Biden video.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.760]   So who is doing the Cain gang?
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   Obviously not Herman.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   From hell.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   Wow.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.040]   He's keeping up on the election though.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.200]   You gotta respect the guy.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.640]   No.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.640]   So by the way...
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.480]   He voted too.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.160]   You're gonna hear this here first, but I think you're gonna hear more of this.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:45.880]   Twitter has apparently placed somewhat of a hold on banning trolls and things.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.600]   I've been getting emails.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.240]   I regularly go through the things and requests, stuff taken down.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.600]   I've been getting emails saying, "Due to COVID, we're busy and never hearing anything."
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.400]   Again, I've been checking with some other people's services that do this and so forth.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.720]   And they're saying, "Yeah, something weird's going on at Twitter for the last two weeks."
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   No takedowns.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   It's been more than two weeks.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.200]   I've been seeing that for at least a month.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:18.800]   And then this morning, a very well-known rumor guy, the walking cat who we've used for
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.640]   a long time or referred to a long time on Windows Weekly because he does a lot of Windows
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   tweets.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.840]   It was banned.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.080]   He tweeted some information from the Intel event, which happened this morning right before the
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.560]   Intel event, obviously a leak.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.800]   Not anything we hadn't heard before.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.640]   And boom, his page is gone.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.640]   That's weird.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.200]   So they are banning something, but apparently not taking requests.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.920]   It's like that radio station where you call up and they're like, "No, we don't take requests."
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.480]   So it makes you wonder, "Why would he be he or she be banned?
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.040]   Is it just strictly because of rumor mill or what?"
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.440]   Well, but he's been doing these kinds of leaks for several years.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   He's very well-known.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.440]   He's one of the well-known.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.480]   Leaker's often very accurate.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.920]   Does it, that Intel has so much clout that they can call up Jack Dorsey saying, "And
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.880]   Jack, can you help us out here?"
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.880]   And boom, he's gone.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.880]   Or what?
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.400]   Or the algorithms were going a little nutty, I think.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.880]   So Molly Jean Fast, right?
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.880]   Is that how I say it?
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   Yeah, I love her.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   She's great.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.680]   And a friend of mine, Kate Klonick, who's an expert in law, and Section 230 and Facebook
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.680]   and stuff, she tweeted a scene where Molly was on something and she said, "Stop that
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.720]   or I'll kill you."
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.160]   Obviously to a kid or a dog.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.280]   And just quoted that and she got warned for her account being taken down.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.080]   Yeah, I think quoted, "I'll kill you."
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   So it's clearly algorithm.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.960]   I think everybody's gone home.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.560]   We know that.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   And it's just the algorithms now.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.800]   Did you know about the Twitter account called VCbrags?
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.200]   So it's gone now.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   It's not gone.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   It's stopped.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   Why?
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.160]   It's a kind of a funny story.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.000]   So there was speculation because VCs evidently hate VCbrags.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.600]   Yeah, because it's a VC parody account.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   Right.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.880]   And VCs have no, they have too much money and no sense of humor.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.440]   And so VCbrags brags all the time about who's blocking them, what major VCs are blocking
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.680]   them, right?
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:37.800]   So one person who was a VC and is now as a company and gets VC money, there was some
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.840]   joking rumor that it was him because everyone wonders who is this person.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.640]   And he played along for a day because it clearly couldn't be him because he was a VC and no,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   no, no.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.120]   Well, then people actually thought it was him.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.520]   And so it was getting too close for comfort.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.720]   So whoever it is who runs VCbrags said, "Okay, this has been fun.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   I'm going to stop."
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   Really?
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.400]   That said, the story is there.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.840]   But in that, when I was doing my research this morning, trying to find happier topics
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:06.960]   like this, I found the example of, I mean, I saw the work of VCbrags and Professor Cold
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.840]   takes is just brilliant.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.840]   Professor Cold takes.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   I'll let you find out.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   He's the new VCbrags.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.560]   No, no, no.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.360]   He's a subject of VCbrags.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   Ah.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   Callaway.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   Oh, I love.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   And you're no fan.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   I know of Scott Galloway.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   Professor Cold takes.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.360]   He used to like him, but he's going to work with him.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.360]   He's become, so here's Professor Cold takes.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   I still like Galloway.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   I think he's pretty funny.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   I'm going to sit on a heroin before I die.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   And as long as I feel good, you know, I think it'll be worthwhile.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   I thought that'd be funnier.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:46.760]   Listen, here's, this is the official trailer for Professor Cold takes.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:53.280]   On the campus of New York's Stern School of Business comes a respected academic, successful
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:02.880]   entrepreneur, generous philanthropist, best-selling author, and devoted family man.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.040]   He's living the American dream.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.840]   But there's just one problem.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.440]   He just can't seem to get his business predictions right.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.000]   This says Tesla's going to take a dive dropping below $100 a share in the next year.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.480]   Why will it drop below $100?
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.480]   I missed on that one.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.680]   So I made this call three months ago and was at $300 a halfway there.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.920]   The future of transportation, the future of the world, and for if you're a retail investor,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   that's pretty exciting.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.640]   It's now $1,462.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.720]   Macy will be the most successful retailers.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   Not Amazon.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   Not Amazon.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.720]   Oops.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.640]   Macy's lower today after reporting dismal results for the first four online furniture firm.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.520]   Wayfair shares a crash.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.520]   Wayfair.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.520]   It's gone out of business.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.520]   It's over 800%.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.520]   It's over 800%.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.520]   Big winner.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   Everything come back.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.520]   It's way fair stock.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.720]   I saw a spat between him and Calcanis.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.520]   The Galloway and Calcanis?
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.520]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.960]   I don't know who I root for in that one.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960]   Oh, man.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   That's a hard one.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.400]   It was entertaining.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:13.320]   Yeah, Galloway took it as stalking, if you will, from Calcanis.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:19.680]   But I think they were just poking at him because of some of his previous problems.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.720]   People get in fights on Twitter all the time.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.280]   It's like, please get off Twitter.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   Just don't.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.280]   It's not doing anybody.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   You're not doing yourself a favor.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   Just stop it.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.920]   I learned my lesson years ago and getting in a fight with people like Calcanis.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.880]   Now, Daisy, when Leo's going out for the show, Leo was reading something intently.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.880]   I asked him, "What are you reading?"
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.880]   He said, "Go ahead and tell me."
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.880]   I'm going to laugh at you.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.880]   He said, "Twitter."
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.880]   He was engrossed in Twitter.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   He was enjoined in Twitter.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   No, I said Twitter is good.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   He gets on the air.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   He starts smashing Twitter again.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.040]   Can I be clear?
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.360]   I was engrossed in Twitter because as usual with Twitter, I'm trying to understand, "Am
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.640]   I having a stroke or does this tweet make no sense?"
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.160]   That's pretty much my reaction.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.440]   It's like, "What are they talking about?"
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.280]   I guess I'm just not part of the Twitter-rody.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.200]   I still stand by you needing to better curate your Twitter experience.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.520]   I stand by you and I get off of all social media.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.000]   All social media.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.480]   All of it, except TikTok.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   Stay on TikTok.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.040]   I can't wait.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   We're waiting.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.280]   Supposedly, TikTok would be...
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.600]   They said it would be Tuesday, the announcement, who had acquired TikTok.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:35.240]   Microsoft in a consortium with Walmart and who else is involved in that one?
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.960]   Microsoft, Walmart.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.400]   And then there's the Oracle bid.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.920]   So there's at least two bids.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.800]   But then I think, actually, Mary Jo Foley nailed it earlier today on Windows Weekly when she
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.360]   said, "No.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.600]   There's a long weekend coming up.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.600]   Everything.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:58.120]   We're going to have the biggest news dump in the history of the world, 4PM Friday."
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.800]   And among all of the things that they'll announce is who bought TikTok.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.280]   But I'm really curious is how well compensated the US is going to be.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:14.080]   The press, that's the president's phrase, that the US better be well compensated by whoever
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   buys TikTok.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.440]   You just don't understand how it works.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.160]   Is that legal?
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   Is that legal?
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.160]   Acquisitions work.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.160]   He said, "Okay, this is from Bloomberg.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.000]   Donald Trump says he's told people involved in the sale of bite dances TikTok.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.120]   The deal A must be struck by September 15th and B the federal government must be well compensated
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.640]   where the service will be shut down."
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.880]   It's like I don't even, I just can't.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.880]   What?
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.720]   He's got the power, right?
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   Right?
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   It makes...
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.000]   He doesn't know he doesn't actually.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.480]   He doesn't have the power to do this.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   That's the thing.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.560]   I said that tongue in cheek.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.000]   And that's looking out for the United States interests.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.920]   Either we get well paid or we're going to shut it down.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.640]   Well, is it a security threat or not?
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   I don't understand.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.160]   I don't get any of it.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.480]   So I wrote a post about this yesterday.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.360]   And I got really upset because it was about this and it was about the Australians demanding
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.280]   that's another money from writing money from Facebook, which we can talk about together.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.360]   But shutting down TikTok should be a first amendment issue because it is the press of
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.160]   the people.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.960]   Even if it's owned by China.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   I don't care.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.480]   It's what people are using.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.160]   And we have to grapple with that fact that we have a first amendment.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:42.480]   Well, then China is censoring it because China does actually influence...
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.360]   China does influence who can post what people see on TikTok.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360]   So if that's the...
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.360]   They can.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360]   We can't by law.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   Right.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   Okay.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.560]   That's the difference, right?
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.040]   And so if we choose to use it, if the people of America are used as their press and they
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:03.680]   now have a press finally and that press gets taken away from them, I still argue that as
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.000]   a first amendment violation.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It's really an interesting...
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.160]   I mean, I think it's very complicated.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.080]   I think that's a legitimate point of view.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.000]   I think also the theory held by people like Amy Webb that...
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.400]   But it is also a political arm of the Chinese government.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:24.280]   And as a result, we have to be very careful about it because it could be used against
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.520]   us is also a legitimate point of view.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.640]   I don't honestly know what the right answer is on that one.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.680]   Let's move on because there's many, many other things that can cause Jeff's blood pressure
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   to go up and I want to make sure...
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.400]   I was going to say we'll never know the right answer on that.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.440]   And that's what makes this story so difficult for us, I think, as Americans because we're
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.080]   absolutists in ways and we believe there is a central truth.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   Oh, you're so right.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.240]   And here we'll never know the central truth because it's China.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.920]   In China, they don't have a central truth.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.920]   We deal with it.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   And they do.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.200]   And we don't, under the president, that's one of the kind of central tenets of, I believe,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:10.560]   his strategy is confused everything as much as possible so that you can't say with any
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.680]   certainty what's going on.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.880]   That's actually a pretty good strategy as it turns out.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.280]   It works well for me.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.280]   Squirrel!
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.480]   I just pay no attention after a while.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   That's squirrel!
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.480]   You just give up.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.480]   So you're right.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.960]   And we don't like that, do we, Stacey?
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.000]   We don't like living in that gray area between...
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   We hate it.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.120]   Do you think that's human or is that uniquely American?
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:42.920]   I think Americans tend to be uncomfortable with gray.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.600]   We want to make definitive stations.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   I think you're right.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   I think you're right.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.560]   It's part of our national character.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.600]   Because we believe in good and right and wrong, good and evil.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.240]   We believe in that.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.360]   And you can judge.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.640]   And we get really stymied when there's something that is like, I don't know, is it good or
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   bad?
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.640]   I don't know.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.480]   It's chaotic and neutral.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.440]   We don't do well with that.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.440]   We're chaotic, neutral.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.440]   Yeah, chaotic, neutral.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.640]   I don't know what that is.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.600]   Google wants to build a new village.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.360]   Now would you like to live in Google town?
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.120]   Yo, I want to live in Google Island, remember?
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.120]   We were going to live there.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.480]   No, because I don't want to stay in my RV 24/7.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.960]   This is actually so...
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   I think it's specific.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   I had...
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.960]   Excuse me.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   It's not an RV.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   It's a tiny house.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.960]   Tiny house.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.960]   Tiny house.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.400]   This is specifically so Google employees will stop living in the parking lot.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.800]   They want to build a village next to their campus and other Mountain View tech hubs.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.520]   It'll be called Middle Field Park.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.520]   There you are.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.720]   That is going to be called Middle Earth.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   It's like...
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720]   Middle Earth.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.000]   It's been so perfect, right?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.820]   Look, little black children and little white children playing together in the water coming
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.820]   out of the ground.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.820]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.820]   There's also...
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.880]   It's not they're taking showers because nobody can afford to have a hole with a shower.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   I was thinking of the cafe.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.880]   It's not...
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   It's...
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   That's Ellis Plaza.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880]   Is that a...
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.880]   Is that a...
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.120]   That's a self-driving bus in the background, do you think?
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.320]   No, that's the light rail.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   That already exists.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.320]   Oh, it is.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   Always.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   It would dramatically rescope the large area now dominated by old tech buildings and huge
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   parking lots.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.320]   That is a really ugly area.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.320]   Yeah, they are.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.320]   So there's tilt-ups and everything, right?
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.400]   It's 1600 homes.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.840]   Between East Middle Field Road, that's where the name comes from.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:47.960]   And State Route 237, I know exactly where that is.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.040]   Middle Field Park near Middle Field Road is new housing.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:59.400]   In fact, both Apple and Google have both pledged a lot of hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.200]   to fix the housing problem in Silicon Valley.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.800]   And Facebook too, I think all three.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.480]   Yeah, because nobody can afford to live there.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480]   And they can't...
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   It's hard to attract employees now.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.200]   I think one solution is to say, "Well, you don't have to."
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.840]   I suspect that's going to be a big part of the post-COVID world is people working from
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.840]   off-site.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   Yep.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.840]   Off...
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   Way off-site.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840]   Way off-site.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.840]   Like different cities from there.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:30.920]   Google's development, 37% open space, 30% off of space, 24% residential, only 6% parking,
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.040]   2% retail and 1% civic uses.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.600]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.480]   Apparently, Mountain View wants to do it.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.880]   The housing crisis is so awful.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.280]   Would the tax base for this be better than those office buildings?
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.480]   If the office buildings are vacant, yes.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.040]   And I suspect this is...
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.600]   At least at this time, this is probably a concern.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   Google...
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   Google, I would...
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.600]   So in a moment...
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.520]   Are they underwriting...
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.360]   What role does Google have in this other than pushing it?
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.360]   That's a good question.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.360]   I'm reading through this.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.360]   Yeah, I was just...
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.480]   I'm trying to understand if this is going to be strictly a Google property for Google
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.480]   employees and guests.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   No, I don't think so.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.480]   No.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.480]   It's not very yet.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.320]   Because nobody wants any...
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.200]   We don't want company towns coming back.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.720]   Oh, my soul to the company.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   The Comstole.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.800]   Yeah, I think Google does own this, is building this.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.400]   Maybe they even already own the...
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.440]   They were buying up a lot of land.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.280]   Twelve acres of open space, which is pretty nice.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.240]   Well, this is where they can put their smart cities thing.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.520]   We can go and marvel at the...
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.520]   That's true.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   Utopia, dystopian future.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.120]   Take that, Toronto.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:04.600]   Well, it's funny because I talk to a lot of tech industry utopians who have this vision
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:09.120]   of smart cities or smart villages or smart apartment buildings.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:15.680]   This is a very common fantasy in the Silicon Valley world.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.840]   There's somebody's doing this in Vegas.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.880]   Leo, you're talking to the expert right there.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.880]   Who's that?
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.880]   Stacey.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.880]   Are you the expert?
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   I'm the expert.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.880]   Well, she's smart homes.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   You see that?
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   What we're talking about is smart cities.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   You know, Utopia is what's smart homes.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   Nobody has a smarter home than Stacey.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.400]   Well, she would take over the...
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.240]   I'm sure Seattle, if she could, but she starts with her own base.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.640]   Nobody has a smarter home than Stacey.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.200]   You can bought them.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.880]   It's actually not true right now.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.880]   Thank you.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   She's my favorite.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   I appreciate that you...
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.600]   I heard you guys even have windows.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.680]   I heard there's no windows in her house.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   That's what I heard.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.680]   That's what I heard once.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.960]   Not yet.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   So this is interesting.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:04.080]   I don't think it's been approved by the Mountain View City Council yet, but they love these
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.080]   guys.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.680]   But it's unclear.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.040]   Is Google gonna own...
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.320]   If Google owns the land, are they going to pay to develop the housing or are they going
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.360]   to work with the developer and then do they get it?
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.960]   Australian developer that they're working with.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   And lease a developer with Global Scope.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.840]   And lease is big.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.960]   They're huge.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.840]   And they've worked with Google and some other things.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   Okay.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840]   So they're working with them.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   They're going to build the houses.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.240]   Do people buy the houses or do people rent the houses?
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.560]   I don't know.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:48.720]   I imagine that there'll also be a little bit of give and take with the City Council.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.600]   You know, usually what happens with city governments is they say, "Okay.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:57.120]   We want 23% to be low income housing, which we want certain amount to be for sale.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   We want a certain amount to be rent."
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.520]   I suspect that all of that is still to TBD.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.520]   But I think this is very interesting.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:09.000]   But it is a little bit of company town, though, isn't it?
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Really?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.480]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.200]   It's a very very large-age idea.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.560]   Is it something like, do you have to work at Google to be able to live there?
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.560]   I don't know.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.080]   Do you work there?
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.520]   What happens when you get fired?
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   Right.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.800]   I mean, we already tired health insurance, aren't we?
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.960]   Do we want to hire living arrangements?
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.280]   Hey, I like it.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.280]   Why not cradle to grave Google town?
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.680]   I'm there.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.840]   I'm there.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.840]   You are.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.840]   I live there, Jim.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.120]   But what about that?
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.120]   What about that?
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:48.400]   What if you as a young family come move to cradle to grave Google town and Google takes care
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   of you?
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.560]   Google basically runs the local government because they're smarter than the average bear
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.440]   and they use data.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.120]   And the traffic lights are always just right.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.160]   And there's always exactly the right amount of pizza available and all of that.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.900]   Hey, paint-dep
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.240]   Yeah, there's gummy bears in every department.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   What if--
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.720]   Stacey, do you have your question?
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   And then a guaranteed pension, when you hit 65 and a half, you get Google retired.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.880]   Oh, and the death benefits at Google are amazing.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   Are they?
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   Your family is really taking care of you.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:30.880]   And then the funny thing is you move in and four years later, Google closes it down.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.380]   Right.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.880]   In typical Google fashion.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.880]   Say goodbye.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.120]   Sorry, we're going to tear it all down.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   Yes.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   Cradle to grave.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.280]   It's not-- it's not-- we're not getting the data we want.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280]   Stacey, yeah.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   Cradle to third grade.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   That's all we can do.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.000]   Mountain View Voice says it is a mix of rental and for sale housing units, predominantly
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.120]   in the form of stacked flats that can maximize the number of residential units in the area
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.360]   would include 20% affordable housing units.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.160]   God knows how you define affordable in the valley.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:04.560]   Depending upon how many units are built would create 335 or 370 deed restricted units for
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.120]   low income housing.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.920]   I like that idea that all of that is mixed in, but I have concerns on a personal level
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:19.280]   far as if I was working for Google or whatever, like a full time employee at Google.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.840]   I don't know if I necessarily want to live that close to work.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.640]   It's just personally, I need a little bit more separation.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.520]   And like where I live now here in Northern California, I'm just enough to be far away
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.200]   from the studio to feel that I'm not at work, you know, and it's comfortable that way.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:43.320]   I've had people in my past at previous employers where they lived around the block and their
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   phone always ring and they were always at the office.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.000]   And I never thought that was healthy nor did I think it was fair to do that as a employee.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.560]   But on the other hand, having a having had until March at hour and 45 minute each way
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.600]   commute, being near work sounds like heaven to me.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.040]   And that's why I'm kind of a point.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.800]   And then I did have some scenarios where I used to live an hour away and I hated being
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   that far away.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.280]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.600]   There was a sweet spot, you know, being just enough far away.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.000]   But how long does it take you to get to the studio where they can say, Hey, can you come
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.120]   in and unplug and replug this thing in for us?
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:28.320]   You know, that's yeah, no, how long does it take to get to the studio when you go there?
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   Pardon.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.040]   How long does it take you to get to the studio when you actually used to go there?
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.360]   15 minutes, 20 minutes tops.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.600]   Yeah, that sounds lovely to me.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   I love it.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.680]   I've always basically had the five minute commute.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.400]   So or two minute, 30 second.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   I don't really know.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.640]   Do we count like bedroom to coffee to desk?
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:28:00.360]   I have a trailer from the Google Village concept that this is just an example of what
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:07.680]   it will be like when you wake up in your stacked flat in Google town USA.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.840]   Just peek out the window.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.320]   The perfectly manicured lawns.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:18.760]   Where am I?
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.000]   I thought it was going to be pleasant, Bill.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.840]   Now, are you too young to remember the prisoner Stacy?
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.200]   I am too young to remember the prison.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.640]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.720]   One of the greatest shows of all time.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.760]   Still makes no sense, but it makes no sense.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:40.200]   He's a secret agent who decides to get out, but it turns out when you leave the British
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:46.360]   Secret Service, you end up being sent to the village, which is full of kind of stepford
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.640]   wives types and you can't escape.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.920]   Every time you do a giant, a giant ball tracks you down and breaks you back.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.200]   Do you remember this?
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.640]   I know I've never heard of this.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.120]   I need to talk to you just for the hilarity.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.800]   I am a free man.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.320]   I am not a number.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.480]   This is black mirror before there was black mirror.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.400]   It was the greatest.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.400]   It was the greatest.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.400]   It was great.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   When did it career?
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.560]   We were probably too young for the premiere.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.560]   1967.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.560]   Yeah, we've been so young.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   I was 11.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.640]   Yeah, I don't think I would have gotten it, but I definitely saw it soon after.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   I was probably middle school.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   It was British.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   So we didn't see it in the US.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   That's right.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.640]   It's on public TV.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.720]   I've never seen Patrick McGowan, who's great.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.720]   And the funny part is, and I was a big fan of Secret Agent, which was the show prior
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.480]   to that where he played a James Bond style Secret Agent.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:47.960]   And so there was a certain amount of in inside joke when his next thing was the prisoner
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.400]   about a Secret Agent who leaves the Secret Service and is trapped in the village.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.280]   I always love Patrick McGowan.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.680]   I think he was one of my favorite actors in the back of the day.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.800]   Google is pulling or maybe pulling Fediverse apps.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:12.080]   Now we have a Fediverse Mastodon instance called Twit.Social.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:18.840]   And one of the great things about the Fediverse, it's a competitor to Twitter, but it is decentralized.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:24.240]   So if you go to Twit.Social, you'll sign up for a Mastodon account.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.560]   And then we federate with other Mastodon instances.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:35.400]   And there's software that you could put on iOS or Android that lets you join the Fediverse.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:41.120]   Google has warned it's going to pull many of these programs from the Play Store for,
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.720]   and this is interesting, interesting problem.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.160]   Exciting hate speech.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:53.680]   Android titles like FetaLab, Husky, and Subway Tutor help you connect to Twit.Social, but
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.800]   also help you connect to things like GAB.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:07.160]   When GAB was shut down for being home to neo-Nazis and so forth, they moved to a fork for Mastodon.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.560]   They became part of the Fediverse.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:16.840]   Now every Mastodon instance I'm part of, including our own, BloxGAB and other, you know, Nazi sites.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.080]   Certainly neo-Nazis are a problem on Twitter.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.440]   Interesting that Google wants to shut it down, not by, you know, trying to shut down these
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:31.240]   Fediverse sites like GAB, but by blocking the clients.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:37.560]   The apps as of a couple of days ago are still on the Play Store, according to Gajit.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.920]   So maybe they thought better of it after getting some publicity.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   It's an interesting conundrum.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.280]   This is what people get to try to do to Google, right, with the right to be forgotten.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.600]   Well, we're not going to pull down those sites that have articles we don't like.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.640]   We'll just pull them from the search results so they don't exist.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.000]   Pull it in the Fediverse.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.200]   Yeah I think it's overreaching.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.520]   And it would hurt us.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:10.400]   I mean, Twit.Social is, I mean it's not exactly the most vibrant place in the world.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:17.080]   This is the problem with Mastodon in general is that it's not well known, I think.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.080]   Right.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:22.840]   So I'm not, I actually am not logging on this machine that shows you how often.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:28.800]   But because it's not centralized, you can't say one thing or another.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.720]   You could pull down any given server, I guess, or complain about any given server.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:40.560]   But you can't attribute any particular kind of content to the Fediverse as a whole, or
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   can you?
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.320]   I don't know.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.560]   This is what a lawyer is needed.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.560]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.000]   Sounds like loophole city.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.440]   I don't know.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.240]   I didn't know there was a Fediverse.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   I feel kind of ignorant.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   Twit.Social.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   Here it is.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:02.680]   If you want to visit the Fediverse, go right on in there.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.440]   Because, you know, it looks a lot like Tweet Deck, right?
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.880]   Instead of tweeting, you toot.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.560]   Because the, the, it sounds like you fart.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.560]   Wait, I don't know.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.720]   Well, the mascot is a Mastodon.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720]   No beings needed.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.720]   So it's an elephant.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:21.480]   It's a Mastodon, like a conglomeration of Mastodon servers is the Fediverse?
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:30.400]   Well, Mastodon is, and there is Mastodon.Social, which is Eugene's home server.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.760]   But what it really is, is software and a protocol.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.000]   And so we set, for instance, I set up a Twitter.Social server running on a different server.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.160]   But if, so my address is Twit.Social, Twit.Social@leo.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:51.880]   And if you are on Mastodon.Social, you can follow Twit.Social@leo.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.880]   That's my fully qualified name.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.280]   And then my toots will show up in your, your toot stream.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.120]   I think I could do without your toot.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   Oh, sorry.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   I'm going to try.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.120]   Yes, I don't.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.160]   I'm just like, no, don't eat them.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.520]   Don't want them.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:18.160]   By the way, did you see the Washington Post story today about toilets and COVID?
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.560]   Well, we knew that never go into the bathroom.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.360]   We suspect it's worse.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.360]   It's worse.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.040]   So the issue is, well, we've said for, they've said, experts have said for a while that COVID
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.360]   can be spread both through saliva and through poop.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:40.320]   But the problem is if you go in a public restroom and once you flush the toilet, as you know,
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:45.400]   that's, you know, kind of aerosol, whatever is in there, it's a yes.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.280]   By the way, those Dyson hand dryers too, they're really good at that as well.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.040]   Usually when you put your hands under the Dyson, you've washed them.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.400]   So that's a little.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.400]   Oh, really?
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.440]   So you wash them first.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.080]   That makes a lot more sense.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.240]   I'm like, every time people are like, freak it out about that, I'm like, but your hands
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   are clean.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.760]   Well, but it also picks up whatever is in the air.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.680]   And the problem with COVID is it, I think really now it's kind of widely accepted.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.400]   It's an aerosolized spread.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.520]   That's the real problems, not fomites.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520]   It's the aerosol.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.760]   That's at least what I read.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.280]   You're the one who follows all these people on Twitter.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:28.880]   But there is actually a toilet or a Dyson is an excellent aerosolizer.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.600]   And so you go into a public restroom, there could be a, you know, and these, once it's
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.200]   aerosolized, it can last for many hours.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.240]   There could be just this floating cloud.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.120]   Unless you change the air in the room, like a tunnel hour.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.160]   You have to really ventilate.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   So by the way, put the seat down before you flush.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.600]   If you have a lid, but many men's rooms do not have lids.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.840]   Most public ones don't.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:57.440]   Yeah, but even in your home, y'all, like I sometimes see people in your house and they've
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.680]   got their toothbrush in their bathroom.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.720]   Oh, and they're fond of that Stacey.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.600]   And you need to like always shut that lid before you flush, especially if you're too
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   sick there.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   Oh, man.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   Yep.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.000]   Well, I think we've all learned something today.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.360]   Maybe we should take a break for commercial.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.000]   Too bad, Toto is not a sponsor any longer.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.760]   I would really love to do a Toto ad right now.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.280]   The Toto Washlet would be perfect here.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   They were a sponsor.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.160]   Oh, I love them even more now.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.280]   Oh, I have three of them.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.160]   Every bathroom in our house has a Toto.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.040]   I got the first one I had to convince Lisa.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   She said, I don't want you.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.280]   It's one of those Japanese bidet toilets.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.160]   And you've used ours.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.680]   And no, she did.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.680]   I didn't.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.680]   She did.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.680]   Oh, she did.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.680]   Okay.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.440]   So I said, Lisa, when she get this, it'd be really cool because I think we'd even used
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.440]   them in Japan.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.240]   And she said, no.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.920]   So I said, just try it.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.680]   So we put it in the master.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:04.520]   And she said, after a month or two, we had them everywhere because it's like, anyway,
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.320]   that's not our sponsor, do they?
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.280]   No.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   This is twig.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   Last.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   This is speaking Toto.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.880]   No, we had Toto Washlet's were a sponsor for one.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.800]   I think it was actually a wayfare co-op.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.320]   So I think it was actually a wayfarer ad or wherever they were.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.840]   Yeah, I think there were solums through wayfarer.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.760]   So who is today's sponsor, Leo?
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.520]   Well, I'm glad you asked Tacey Higginbotham.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.680]   It's last pass.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.360]   Here we are in the last pass studios.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:36.280]   Oh, we're putting together a good last pass event for, you know, October is security months.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.920]   Next month is security month.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.320]   So we're going to do a couple of events all around security.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.320]   We're going to do a last pass event.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.880]   I pitched this to them and I thank you last pass for going for it.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.600]   We're going to have red teams and blue teams.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.520]   We're going to have hackers and defenders.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.760]   And the hacker team is going to come up with an attack and they're going to fire it at
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.960]   the defenders.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.520]   And then the defending team, which will consist of security experts, will say, well, here's
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.280]   how we would defend against that.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.600]   I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.400]   And I think we'll learn an awful lot.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.080]   So stay tuned for the details on that last pass event coming up.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.160]   It's I think our third last part of the past event of the year, we've really been having
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.360]   fun doing these.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.040]   You know who last pass is, of course.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.200]   Last pass is all about what they call in the biz.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.840]   I am.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.960]   Identity and access management.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.800]   I think a lot of people think of last pass as a password vault.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   And it sure it's that.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.720]   In fact, it's the best password vault ever.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.160]   I stored more than passwords in there.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.840]   My passports, my driver's license, social security numbers, PGP keys, anything that
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:44.080]   needs to be securely stored, but available on all my devices, last pass is the place
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.120]   to put it.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.240]   But it's so much more than just a vault.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.920]   You think of security, it's either security or convenience.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.240]   You know, one or the other, you can't have both.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.440]   But single sign is a perfect example of something that's more secure, better than passwords.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   And it's more convenient.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.600]   You just press yes on your phone and you're logged in.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.600]   You want your employees to use last pass to protect them.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.240]   And you want to and you're not just them, but you're most vital resources.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.920]   You're banking, your databases, customer records, things like that.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.520]   But you want it, it has to be convenient or they won't use it.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.400]   Plus you want a centralized view of what they're doing.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.360]   You always, you need to know who has access to what from where, especially with employees
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   at home, right?
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.080]   They're no longer coddled in the umbrella of the IT department.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.760]   They're on their own networks, which come and go.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.480]   They're up and down.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:41.360]   You want to make sure that if it looks like Joe from accounting is logged into QuickBooks,
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:46.560]   it really is Joe from accounting, not the meat tree from Sub-Sabasta Pool.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.080]   So it's really important, really important that you use last pass.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:58.120]   Enterprise password management gives oversight, a shadow IT and enforceable policies.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.640]   For instance, we require two factor of all our employees.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.040]   We have minimum master password requirements.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.360]   Multi-factor authentication.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.920]   This is so sweet.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.200]   It's more than just fingerprint or face recognition.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.440]   This shirt uses biometrics but also uses a contextual factor, things like IP address
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.960]   and geolocation.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.840]   It makes the process even easier for employees and it makes you more secure.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.600]   And if you're sharing passwords and you know what, all employees share passwords.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   And they're at home.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.800]   You don't want them texting or emailing passwords to their colleagues.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.240]   LastPass makes it easy and safe for employees to share logins.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.200]   Keeping access to your data safe, there's a completely secure channel within LastPass
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   for password sharing.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.280]   These will always have their passwords with them.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.880]   They can access the things they need to do to get the job done no matter where they're
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.920]   working from any device, Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux, everything.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.960]   Working remotely is actually more convenient, not more frustrating.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.480]   And you'll rest easy knowing your business is secure with LastPass.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.160]   We asked 10 years ago, Steve Gibson was shown every bit of LastPass.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.840]   The creator Joe Seagriss gave him the tour.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.040]   Steve was blown away.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.680]   AES 256 bit encryption.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:17.520]   They use PBKDF2, which is the key derivative factor, which makes it hard to brute force
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.520]   any password.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.440]   They use salted hashes.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.880]   I mean, they do it all right.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   And Steve verified that.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.840]   I said, "Yep, this is the way you should do it."
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.800]   Your data is decrypted and encrypted only at the device level.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:33.160]   Your password is never sent to LastPass.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.320]   It's secret from everyone, including from LastPass.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:41.720]   The number one password manager, but a whole lot more, LastPass, premium, LastPass for
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.720]   families.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.120]   That's what Lisa and I use at home.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.440]   And at work, we use LastPass and her price.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.400]   Let LastPass securely manage your users' identity.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:54.120]   Letting your employees work efficiently without making your business vulnerable to cyber threats.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.840]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   That's the address.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.840]   We use it.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.840]   You should use it.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.960]   And we are so grateful to LastPass for not only keeping us secure, but for supporting
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.040]   this week in Google and all of our efforts here at Twit.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.320]   They are the, of course, the naming rights sponsor for the Twit's LastPass studios.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.920]   Let me really appreciate it.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.320]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.640]   I thought this was a very provocative and kind of interesting article.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:26.120]   I know, Jeff, you're going to laugh at it from Goliath Edelman.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.120]   This is in Wired.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.400]   Should Google's ad market be regulated like the stock market?
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:35.240]   Edelman is an expert in antitrust.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.040]   And his point is kind of interesting.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:48.320]   He says, actually, he's quoting antitrust scholar, Dina Srinivasan, who was written a
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.400]   paper, the antitrust case.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.840]   She wrote the antitrust case against Facebook last year.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:59.560]   Now in the Stanford Technology Law Review, she has a new paper in which she talks about
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.120]   how the Google ad market works.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.440]   And I've always had a kind of vague idea, a vague understanding of it.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.440]   It's fairly complex.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.280]   This is the auction we've talked about before.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.200]   Here's how Edelman describes it.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:18.160]   When you see an ad online on a website, for instance, not on our podcast, but on websites,
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.680]   for instance, the odds are very high.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.160]   The advertiser used Google to buy the ad.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.840]   The website used Google to put the space up for sale.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.040]   Those exchange matched them together.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:37.240]   In other words, Google runs both the largest exchange and competes as the biggest buyer and
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.520]   seller on that exchange.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:44.120]   It also, on top of that, owns YouTube, one of the biggest suppliers of ad inventory,
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.160]   meaning it's competing against publishers on its own platform.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:56.080]   And Srinivasan argues, this is exactly what antitrust law was created to protect against,
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.760]   but nobody even thinks twice about it.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.520]   There apparently is no regulatory oversight of digital advertising.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.600]   If YouTube wasn't even-- Hold on.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.920]   Let me-- Let me-- Let me-- Yes, absolutely.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.920]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   You guys are too polite.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.960]   Well, I was wondering if YouTube wasn't in the picture, would this be a concern, but
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.360]   also just what are the other options?
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.600]   There was what was that?
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.600]   Bing, right?
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   It's not that--
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.600]   Well, it's not that--
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.600]   It's not that--
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.320]   Is it that they're not able to capture more of them?
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   Boy, it was very good.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   It's both ends of a market.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.680]   It's both ends of a market.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.840]   That's the problem.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:37.320]   It's the same problem as when the movie companies own the movie theaters.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.040]   And it's a classic antitrust case.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.480]   They were forced to divest.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.760]   You can't own both the distribution and the product.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.760]   Got you.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   There's two things--
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   Car dealerships.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   There's two things--
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   Car manufacturers.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   Right.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.080]   So two things about this.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:45:00.520]   I've always said that where Google is most vulnerable is not search, it's advertising.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.680]   And it does have the power of God in advertising.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.000]   And they needed to be more mindful of that as they went.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.920]   However, the way these exchanges work, if I'm on AppNexus, which was bought by Oracle,
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:18.160]   which is huge, which actually invented programmatic advertising, and that's where I do my-- it's
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.840]   still-- it still interoperates with Google.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.480]   So it's not as if Google is a closed world.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:31.720]   The auctioning, the bidding, occurs across multiple trading forms.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.760]   So that might be-- the problem is Google has the biggest on both sides.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.760]   Yes.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.760]   No question.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.840]   And by double click.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:44.360]   And they compete against every other product because they own the--
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.640]   Well, you're on their exchange and they're selling ads on it.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.400]   But the other thing to consider is-- right.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.720]   So if Google-- I've always talked about this.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.640]   If Google were an old style media company, they would have been a closed network and they
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.960]   would have said Google has lots of traffic and lots of audience.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.640]   And we're like Yahoo!
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   Or like the New York Times, we're cutting ass.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.320]   We sell our audience what the market will bear.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.560]   But of course, Google didn't do that.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.040]   With AdSense, it said Google said, we're going to put ads across anybody and wants them.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.640]   And so we're going to send billions of dollars, literally billions of dollars to media companies
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:22.040]   everywhere, because our ads benefit media everywhere.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:26.720]   And so the models are so off from what media used to be.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.880]   Media used to be about scarcity and controlling scarcity.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.360]   Google was about advantaging abundance.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.920]   And so any law that exists is irrelevant for how this operates.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:43.560]   Not because it's sneaky, but because it's just taking advantage of a new reality.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.760]   If this sounds familiar, you may remember when Senator Pichai was testifying in front
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:55.560]   of Congress, Pramila Jayapal from Washington actually cited the paper.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.360]   She said, the problem is Google controls all these entities.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.280]   So it's running the marketplace.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.120]   It's acting on the buy side.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.040]   It's acting on the sell side at the same time, which is a major conflict of interest.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:10.720]   It allows you to set rates very low as a buyer of ad space for newspapers, which has
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.720]   hurt them, right?
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.000]   It's deprived them of ad revenue.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.520]   And then also sell high at the same time as you're setting it low for the newspaper.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.960]   You're setting it high for the small businesses who depend on advertising on your platform.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.560]   So actually, Leo, this is where I've had this argument with people in the newspaper business.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.480]   I'll tell you two sides of this.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:39.440]   I've said to them, when the New York Times, when Google announced AdSense, I was there
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:46.280]   that day, and I'm not old, when the New York Times was at the press conference at the event
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   saying, we're going to do this.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.440]   And I turned to the vice president of the New York Times at the time, who I knew well.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.160]   And so why the hell are you doing this?
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.800]   Why the hell are you doing this?
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.200]   Why you letting Google in?
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.640]   And the argument I heard is not only from the New York Times, but especially from smaller
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.120]   papers was, I can expose my inventory to advertisers.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.880]   I could never possibly ever in a million years sell to.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.880]   Yeah, but it ended up being a deal.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.640]   It ended up being a deal with a devil.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.960]   Well, then right.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.520]   So then the next problem is, of course, it commodified them because what matters is the
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.880]   data about the user, not the environment, and it lowered the prices because it was, that's
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.720]   what a bundled stuff.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.720]   Yes.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   I was at the event that was--
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:29.040]   And I have to give credit to Adam Curry for crystallizing this in my mind.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.560]   I don't give Adam Curry much credit at all for anything, but I do give him credit for
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560]   this.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:41.840]   That's the key because display ads in a newspaper were a limited scarce commodity, right?
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.920]   Digital ads are unlimited.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.520]   There's no scarcity at all.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.520]   Want some more?
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.600]   We'll make some more.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.280]   So it's a very different environment.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:54.320]   And that what happens when something becomes a commodity as opposed to a scarce entity is
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.760]   the price falls, right?
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.760]   Because it's commoditized.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.160]   Well, it's just abundance alone.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:04.320]   We had an event at the school, it was under chatterhouse rule, so I won't say who it was.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.440]   But I had a major executive, not from Google.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:11.680]   I'll say that, from the programmatic ad world.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.600]   And this executive looked at the media people.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:21.160]   I had top-level sea-level people, media people in the room, and he or she scolded them and
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.600]   said, why the hell are you on programmatic?
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.880]   Programmatic was intended to get more inventory for direct response.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.040]   It commodifies you.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.200]   You shouldn't be there.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.560]   You should be selling directly.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.440]   What the hell?
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:38.520]   And one of the executives in the room who was a digital pure play executive said, yes,
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.920]   but sorry, bud, I got to go to where the ad dollars are, and all the ad agencies and
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.440]   all the ad dollars are in programmatic, because they didn't get these great deals.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:51.040]   And so that's where I have to put my advertising.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.800]   So what about the premise?
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.640]   Should Google's ad market be regulated like the stock market?
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.640]   Should it be regulated?
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   Yes.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   Would it be a stock market?
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   No.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:08.880]   She writes that on the 13 US stock exchanges combined about 50 million trades happen every
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:17.840]   day on Google's market alone, trade desk, tens of billions of transactions, tens of billions
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.160]   of transactions every day.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.520]   Because every little ad, because an ad costs $0.05.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:30.920]   It's a scarcity, by the way, and costs hundreds of dollars.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.360]   Every time you open a page, folks, and in the time it takes for that ad to come onto
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.880]   the page, all of this auctioning is occurring in the background.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.040]   That's really important.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:48.840]   The minute you hit a page and starts loading, the auction begins.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:56.040]   It happens within the milliseconds of loading time before that ad's displayed to you.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:00.160]   There's been a bidding war, and the highest bidder has won that ad.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   Yes.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   Yep.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.160]   Wow.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:10.880]   Based on not on environmental data, that is not on a boot ad on a boot page in GQ, but
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.480]   based on cookie data.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.200]   This is what may change, right?
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.840]   Because of cookies and browsers and all that changing.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.440]   But the data about you is more vibrant.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:24.000]   The other part of this is so-called retargeting or remarketing ads.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.400]   You went to Amazon, you looked at some boots.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.800]   Those friggin' boots follow you around for three months, even though you bought the goddamn
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   things.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.120]   Which, by the way, is, don't be so scared about the big--
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.760]   No, that's an inefficient answer.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.400]   That's actually not good.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:46.800]   But that data point about you, boot-interested buyer, consumer, is more valuable than any
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   environment.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.040]   You're looking at a weather site or a sports site or a food site.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.400]   The damn boots are there.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.680]   Because that's how remarketing, retargeting, and programmatic work together.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:02.760]   You may remember that some months ago Google announced, "Yeah, we've decided cookies are
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.120]   a privacy violation.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.680]   We're going to knock that off.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.560]   The new Chrome browser will turn off third-party cookies."
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.560]   And everybody cheered.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.400]   Google's doing the, you know, "God's work to protect your privacy."
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.200]   And being the skeptic, I am, said, "Well, that must be because they've got some better
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   system."
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:27.040]   In fact, yesterday on Security Now, Steve Gibson talked about the better system, which
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:36.240]   is essentially a perfect fingerprinting system that anybody can run if you load their page
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:40.400]   that identifies you much better than cookies ever did.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:46.200]   So Google said, "You don't need them anymore."
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.160]   Right.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.600]   Everybody hated cookies.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.680]   Once we discovered cookies, we were like, "Oh, I don't like cookies."
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.080]   And then we got super cookies and we're really against those.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:59.200]   And then now, basically, this is kind of like a super cookie, isn't it?
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.000]   So the title...
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.280]   Oh, come on now.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   Come on.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.280]   Get some pepto or something.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.280]   That's just not good.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.520]   I mean, so mean, y'all.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:19.240]   Well, you were talking about tooth.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.720]   The title of Security Now yesterday is, "I Know What You Did Last Summer."
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.800]   It's the end piece of it.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.440]   And he talks about fingerprinting.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.160]   It doesn't even need to be a cookie.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:37.400]   For instance, when you load a page, the page in the background can load another page
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.200]   with sites on it and can tell if you've been to those sites or not.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.800]   They can actually read your...
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.440]   It affects, read your internet history.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.760]   And by doing so, it depends.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.720]   The more sites you visit, the more accurately they can do this.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.960]   But by doing so, they can uniquely identify you.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.960]   So...
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   Here's interesting.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   Go ahead.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.960]   Go ahead.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.960]   No, that's fine.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.960]   That's all.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.840]   So I just put up something on the rundown at the bottom, or other.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:13.040]   Alex Stamos, linked to Kevin Munger, who linked to a new paper, that found that politically
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.880]   targeted advertising basically doesn't do Jack.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:17.880]   And all the talk about...
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.880]   Micro-targeting.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:23.240]   And it's going to change people's brains, and they're making a fortune.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:28.680]   And Alex is just joking that salespeople at Google and Facebook are going to...
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.080]   Shh, don't tell anybody.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.440]   And Alex says, "The political advertising is a small part of the revenue.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:39.240]   But if this goes to larger level micro-targeting advertising, what this study says is, doesn't
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:44.880]   that mean you can do anything?"
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.880]   This is...
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.640]   Steve was quoting a paper.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:52.120]   That's kind of an interesting story.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:57.520]   It was delivered at the 16th usenix on usable privacy and security.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.120]   And they duplicated a paper from eight years ago.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:06.440]   The paper from 2012 was called "Why Johnny can't browse in peace on the uniqueness of
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:09.400]   web browsing history patterns."
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:14.160]   And this second paper said, "Well, we're going to go back and duplicate that methodology
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:21.880]   and see if it's gotten better or worse."
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:29.160]   They identified 48,919 distinct browsing profiles, of which 99% are unique.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.760]   Why uniqueness holds even when histories are truncated to just 100 top sites?
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:40.760]   So basically, if they could just see the last 100 sites you visited, they can pick you
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:48.280]   out with 99% accuracy from 50,000 other people, I guess, from an infinite number of other
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.120]   people that you are absolutely unique.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.120]   Wow.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.120]   So that's...
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:56:02.720]   Really interesting, this is from three Mozilla researchers, why we can't still browse in
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   peace.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:11.160]   And this is why do not track and third party cookies and all that stuff, just hand waving
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:17.520]   at this point, because modern browsers can get so much information about you in all sorts
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.600]   of sneaky ways, and they can clearly identify you.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:25.920]   But it may not do nearly as much good as the ad industry is trying to tell people.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.920]   Well, absolutely.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:34.920]   I mean, that's the part of it that you referred to that doesn't work, which is this targeting.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:38.440]   And I think that's probably because the backends aren't very well done.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.240]   It's recommendation engines are notoriously awful.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.640]   Look at Amazon, look at Netflix.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   They just don't...
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.640]   Well, is advertising...
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.120]   Is advertising... sorry to say this is not a show supported by advertising, but especially
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.960]   when it gets down to that level, how effective is it?
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:55.960]   Right.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.960]   I know YouTube is...
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:57.960]   I don't know.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.960]   I have a lot of things based on it.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.960]   So pretty good for me.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.960]   Instagram ads, they work.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.960]   I use YouTube...
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:12.640]   I use YouTube quite a bit, and I'm always hitting like or dislike on things that I watch,
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.600]   because I watch YouTube as if I'm watching regular TV.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:20.880]   And the recommendations for the last several years have just been a dream for me because
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.880]   I fed it.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.800]   I fed the algorithm.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:29.360]   And it's not uncommon for me at the end of the day to go downstairs and turn on the
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:36.800]   TV and fire up YouTube and watch hours of random stand up comics or something about photography
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.240]   or what it knows what I like.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.880]   And it does a good job.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   Right.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   That works, Adam.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:43.880]   Do you see ads?
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:44.880]   Do you see ads?
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.880]   Do they work?
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.000]   The ads is another story because I never see them.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   I paid.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Right.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   You pay.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   It's my premium price.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   Right.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   Right.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Where do you get sucked in?
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   Stacey.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:04.880]   Oh, you know, I get sucked in because I looked at something like maybe I've...
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.040]   Right now I have a house, right?
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.080]   So I'm buying some crazy furniture or things like that.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:13.320]   And being stalked, I'll be honest, by like a piece of furniture or a rug, you're like,
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.320]   "Oh, there it is again."
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.200]   It keeps a top of mind.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.100]   And you're in the market.
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.100]   You're a golden.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.100]   And I'm in the market.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.100]   I'm beautiful for these people.
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.100]   They love me.
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:27.400]   They're like, "This woman has money to spend and floors to cover.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.200]   Show her all the rugs."
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.160]   Well, and it wasn't hard for them to figure that out about you.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.920]   They didn't have to do any secret manipulation of your history to know that you just bought
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.920]   a house.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.280]   You know, like record.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.280]   And I mean, they know...
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.280]   Well, again, I just search for rugs.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.280]   And you go to Google and rugs.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:51.560]   I will say, Google in my news section then recommends what's frustrating is like, "Google
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:57.360]   right now, if I go through my news, it has stopped being so much about IoT and like quantum
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.920]   computing.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.920]   And now it is like, it's a...
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:01.920]   Trim up.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.080]   Corn design elements.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.480]   How to look for a rug.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.480]   Right.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   You know, you're fucking...
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.480]   Oh, yeah, they're smart.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:08.480]   They're not going to get to you.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   That's why you're not up in Instagram.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   But that's not smart.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   It's stupid.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.480]   Oh.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.560]   That's stupid because it's not advertising.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:19.760]   It's assuming the things I'm searching for to buy are also things I'm interested in researching
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.080]   or knowing about from a content perspective.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.840]   And they're two very different things.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:25.840]   Right.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.040]   But Google's just like, "Throat all at you."
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.880]   I bet you in that content, there are a few ads.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:33.880]   Probably?
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.880]   Right.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.880]   Isn't content?
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.880]   Oh, yeah, they do.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.880]   They have sponsored ones.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.880]   Isn't content?
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.880]   Sometimes.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   Just...
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.880]   It's just a jello mold to hold the ads.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.880]   My stories are on there.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.880]   No.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.160]   And actually a lot of my...
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:57.320]   If I look down my news feed, right, I've got The Verge telling me about Amazon surveying
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.160]   its flex delivery drivers.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.640]   Do I...
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.920]   I've got The Guardian.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.200]   Let's see what else do I have.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.840]   It's a stupid story.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.680]   I have a story about window.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.320]   What to plant in the fall because I Google P&E's the other day.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.320]   There you go.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.480]   Not something I really want to think about the rest of my life.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.480]   I bet you brought to you by your local garden store.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.600]   No, it's an apartment therapy though.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.720]   So it's a sponsor.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.120]   It's like their affiliated links.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.960]   Oh, okay.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.040]   And they do tell me that the best way to do it is not to go to my local garden store,
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:40.200]   but to go to these online stores that sell their stuff.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.880]   And why they happen to have some links for that.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.440]   We have goodbye to your garden store.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.160]   Bye-bye garden store.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.840]   But no, I'm going to my garden store.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.600]   Those people are awesome.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   I love them.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.000]   I'm not security expert.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.400]   I'm not security expert, but you were talking about how smart these modern browsers are nowadays
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.560]   regardless of cookies.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:09.640]   What can we do as consumers to sort of help protect ourselves other than VPN?
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.080]   Is there anything?
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.120]   No, VPN won't protect you.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120]   Right.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.120]   I mean, is there anything?
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.360]   So one of the techniques these sort of houses use.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.160]   Try it from the ISP, but that's about it.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:28.360]   As you know, when you click a link in a browser, that link is marked visited.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.960]   It used to be in the old days of the internet.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.640]   It would turn the link would be purple instead of blue.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   But most places.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   I don't get that.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.800]   I remember that.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:41.160]   But that mark visited or not visited persists regardless of what color it is.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:46.320]   So one trick that I think would completely have nothing that you could use a VPN to
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.840]   in matter is they would load a shadow page which you don't see and then they can actually
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:56.680]   query the browser for which links have been visited.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.760]   They just by doing that, they just grabbed your web history for whatever many sites they
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.760]   put on there, right?
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.120]   And I said, Oh, whoever this is, I don't know who it is.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.240]   The IP address, I don't recognize because it's your own a VPN.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.160]   But look at of these hundred sites, I just fired up.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.640]   This person has visited 29 of them on these dates.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.000]   Oh, that's an improvement.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.680]   And he's interested in boots.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.680]   Oh, we know.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.920]   Yeah, we showed him those boots last time.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.920]   Let's show him again.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.480]   He still hasn't bought them.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.480]   Or maybe he did.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.480]   We don't know.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.480]   We don't know.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.480]   We're going to keep on joining the boots.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:34.040]   Even from clearing your commerce data shared with Google.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.040]   Why not?
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.960]   I mean, because that's how they would know if you bought the boots or not.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.720]   To be said, yeah.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.040]   And to answer your question, aunt, if you clear your history, no, they wouldn't see
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.040]   that.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.120]   That's based on your history.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.640]   But do you want to clear your history?
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:57.400]   I guess every time you could most brown you could set it to do that.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.400]   Periodically.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.240]   Well, that'll help.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.760]   You should probably clear it every time.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.160]   If you use a service like LastPass, clearing your cash actually is not as painful.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160]   Right.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.160]   Yeah, because at least you've got the passwords.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160]   That's right.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.800]   I mean, that's the biggest, that's the biggest complaint I have whenever I clear my cash.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.320]   I'm like, oh, there go all the passwords.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.760]   So I can, and I'm looking at Firefox, I can delete cookies and site data when Firefox
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.760]   is closed.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.920]   I can check that box.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:35.240]   The problem is, by the way, look how much cookies, site data and cash on this system,
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.200]   1.7 gigabytes.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.200]   Geez, man.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:44.440]   And at the system, it was rebuilt by, you know, a few months ago.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.920]   And I only use it for two shows a week, three shows a week.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.640]   Cookie is not being, it's tiny.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.200]   No, they're saving a lot of stuff.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.200]   That's the cash.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200]   Well, they're saving the cash.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.200]   So I could have that cleared every time.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.800]   Basically, that's like making your browser dumb every time.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.240]   That could be three ads.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.120]   Could be three ads, 1.7 gigs.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.120]   I don't know.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.480]   Let me just, I'll clear that data right now and I can, I'll clear it.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.000]   So cookies and site data is only 759 megabytes.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.160]   That's totally hot.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.720]   Only cash web contents, one gigabyte.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.840]   So it's actually very close.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.640]   So I'm going to clear all that.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.360]   Now my browser is like fresh and clean again.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.680]   And every time I close it, it's going to do that.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.760]   You'll see, I'll keep it that way for a while.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.800]   We'll see if it makes it harder to, I don't think it'll affect me.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.800]   Cookies might.
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.960]   But like, who uses cookies anymore, right?
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.400]   So Facebook, you mentioned this and I dropped the ball.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.120]   I apologize.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.480]   Facebook, here it is, an update about changes to Facebook's services in Australia.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.040]   Jeff, give us the background on this.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.040]   This is Rupert Murdoch's.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.560]   So the background is that there is Murdoch backed legislation in Australia that would
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:05:00.520]   make Facebook at all negotiate with a gun to their head with publishers for the right
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.040]   to link to the content.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.280]   And so this has happened in various other forms in Germany.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:13.760]   It's the Leistogschutzrecht in France, the, in Spain, rather, the link tax in the EU
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.760]   article.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.760]   Wait, I need to get my shot glass.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.760]   Hold up.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:22.560]   This is, this is the light like shouldn't, like I'm going to say show.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.560]   So now, okay.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.560]   Sorry.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.560]   You're getting better.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560]   You're getting better.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.560]   You're getting closer by about 10 miles.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560]   It's so hard.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:35.200]   So, so this is, this is, this is the publishers saying to the government, let us put our pocket,
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.840]   our hands in Facebook's pocket.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.960]   They took money from us because God gave us that money and, and, and, and they should
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.960]   give it to us.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.280]   Now, Murdoch is basically saying give me government support, but nobody, no conservative
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.880]   politician is going to pay Murdoch.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:52.360]   So what they're saying is, take the money from Facebook and give it to us.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.560]   Because there's some writers.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.640]   So, so Facebook has said, and Google have said, no, we're sending you value.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.920]   We're sending you audience.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.400]   We're not going to do that.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.400]   No.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.120]   And, and Australia has been trying to act all tough.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.680]   We're going to, we're going to find a way to get money anyway.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:12.040]   So Facebook came up with a statement two days ago and said, if you do this, we are going
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:17.640]   to cut off anyone, media companies or users from posting news to Facebook.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:22.920]   Now, that's obviously a matter of negotiation in terms of what they're trying to do.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   They're trying to fire a shot against Australia's bow here.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.120]   But you think about it, Facebook would probably be very happy without news.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.320]   News causes trouble.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.320]   News is controversy.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.840]   They don't make any money on news.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.840]   Fine.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.400]   You could, you know, be careful what you wish for Murdoch at all.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.400]   In the case of Murdoch, it's, it's regulatory capture.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.560]   Because let's say that Facebook does that.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.240]   No more news of any sort on Facebook.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.720]   Murdoch owns the big brands.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.600]   The big brands are still going to be okay because they have name recognition.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:51.880]   People will still go to them.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:56.040]   But every little competitor of Murdoch's, every startup trying to compete with Murdoch,
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.040]   they're all screwed.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.200]   So he's fine either way.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.200]   He's happy.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.200]   Right.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:05.840]   So here's what Facebook is threatening in their post, assuming this draft code becomes
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:13.000]   law, we will reluctantly, oh, so reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people and people
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.440]   in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.440]   Boom.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.440]   Right.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:27.440]   So this is why I wrote about this in the context of TikTok.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:31.080]   Because we have a First Amendment, you know, to go to Stacey's earlier point, we have a
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.640]   First Amendment in our country, which has an impact.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.200]   Australia doesn't.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.560]   But it's a matter to me, a freedom of expression and human rights because the platform that
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.880]   people use to discuss public policy and to discuss government and to discuss what's
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.800]   going on and to share the news that is behind that.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.120]   So we want to hope they do it in an informed fashion gets cut off from under them.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.800]   It's a violation of their human rights.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.560]   This is the people's press.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:58.720]   And I had never really said it that way before, but it is before.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:03.200]   It's the first time in history that everyone has truly had access to a press.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.040]   And now we see governments cutting it off.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.120]   China was doing it already, but now the United States is doing it with TikTok and Australia
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.720]   is doing it with Facebook.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.720]   And Facebook is full well within its rights to say, okay, no news.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.000]   Just cats and party pics.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   That's it.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   That's all we got now.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   No news.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.040]   Our life's going to be a lot easier, folks.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.040]   Mights and actually might be a lot better.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.880]   They might be happy.
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.280]   This might be I might be a lot happier.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.760]   I might go back to Facebook if they do this in the US.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.760]   No more news.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.440]   That'd be great.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:43.440]   But unfortunately, what you're going to get is no more links to established, provable
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.640]   news organizations, but lots of links to Russian troll farms.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.640]   Right.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.640]   They'll come in.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.640]   They'll take advantage of this, right?
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.080]   So anything we wanted to do with this fiction.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.080]   Exactly.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.080]   Exactly.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.040]   But again, Murdoch is cynical and clever and the same.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.280]   I win either way.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.760]   I make my political point.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.040]   I try to get some money out of them.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.120]   I get paid off because Facebook was saying we are going to put Facebook news in Australia
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.280]   and we are going to pay publishers.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:15.400]   And Facebook paid News Corp in the US.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:20.560]   I sat in the event where literally a check was handed over from Mark Zuckerberg to Robert
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.200]   Thompson, the head of News Corp.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.400]   And but Murdoch is making this bigger point.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:32.240]   And what gets me to is that I'm angry at publishers because if you think about it,
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.000]   I thought about this was post two.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.080]   Facebook started never being about news.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.800]   It was about hookups and parties.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.160]   Twitter never started to be about news.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.480]   It was about where am I drinking right now?
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.800]   Google never started about news.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:46.800]   People wanted news.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.800]   They added that, right?
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.880]   In all of these cases, the users brought the news to it.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.520]   The users said, oh, we want to use this thing on Facebook to share news.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.760]   We want to use this Twitter thing to share what we witness out there and share news and
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.760]   talk about it.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.960]   We want to search for news on Google.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.360]   We want to share news and educational, all kinds of stuff on YouTube.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.000]   It was the users that brought this to us.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   Why?
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.560]   Because newspapers were too stuck in their ways to provide that functionality to share
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:15.320]   what people knew and talk about it and so on with their users.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.120]   So they lost those people.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:22.360]   And now they're acting as if God and Australia owed them money and Facebook and Google owed
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.360]   them money back.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.360]   No, it's their own damned fault.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.880]   Sorry, end of rain.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.080]   Well, and it's concerning when you see stories like this, Russia's most notorious troll farm
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:38.760]   reportedly used deep fakes to push a fake news outlet on Facebook.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.520]   And Twitter and they both covered it.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.960]   And Twitter now both pulled them down.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.600]   This was the Internet research agency.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.240]   We've all heard so much about it.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.600]   It never left.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.200]   But I have to say, okay, they pulled this one down.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.840]   And if in absence of legitimate news sources, I suspect a lot of these.
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.680]   They'll try every trick in the book to become the only place you've got to know.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:07.880]   And it's going to get harder and harder because deep fakes are getting easier and easier.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:15.520]   So so it's a cynical effort at protectionism by my own dear industry and I hate them for
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.520]   it.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520]   So that's the end of that.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.520]   And that's going to run.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.520]   And the right of rant.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.080]   All right, let's take another break, change log coming up.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.560]   And then it's the silly season.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.080]   We've got some some silly stories.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:34.360]   By the way, I have to say, I already am hating it that I deleted my history and cookies because
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:40.840]   I just have to re log into Google and re log into Twitter and really.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:46.040]   Didn't take long before I realized why I didn't want to do that.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040]   Yep.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.840]   Google is just thinking, yes, we got him forever now.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.520]   He'll never delete all the cookies again.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520]   Ha ha.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.440]   Well, fortunately, I use a Yubiki.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:01.520]   So logging in isn't too hard, but it's, you know, I got to do it.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.760]   I guess now every time I close my browser, when I have every time I start a show, I'm
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.240]   have to log into everything.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.400]   That's not going to work.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.440]   But that was it wasn't at the premise of cookies from the from the get goes was just
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.840]   to make it more as well.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840]   Better user experience.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.960]   Because the new is dropping.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:19.960]   Is that Stacey?
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   Stacey Stacey.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.680]   I think they drilled through your internet connection.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.680]   Yeah, she's frozen.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.680]   Let's take a break.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.680]   We'll figure this out.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:37.520]   First a word from our sponsor, Monday.com, a team management platform that lets teams
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.160]   plan, manage and track work in one centralized place.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.280]   You can collaborate with your teammates, track everything your team is working on wherever
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:51.600]   you are in any industry, whether you work with a team of five or five thousand, Monday.com
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:55.480]   is the easiest way to keep everybody connected on track.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:01.480]   And with so many employees working working from home these days, Monday.com is a project
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:06.040]   management platform that makes effective teamwork possible anywhere.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:11.160]   I mean, one benefit is you'll keep all your teams working one place without abandoning
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.840]   the tools you use.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:17.440]   You still can use all the tools you've always used like Google Sheets.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.440]   That's what we use.
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.120]   Any Google Docs, Zoom, Slack, email, calendars, everything.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:27.960]   But it all gets automatically imported into the Monday.com interface.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.520]   So every, I know where everybody on my team is, what they're doing, what the project they're
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:36.840]   working on, how far they've gotten, it brings your team together wherever you are.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.880]   You can plan, track and manage your business in one easy to use platform.
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.320]   You'll also improve coordination across teams, across departments because it's so easy to
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.360]   track and manage work that way your team always knows who's doing what, what their deadlines
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.520]   are, what status it is, how far they've gotten so far.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.440]   You'll keep everybody connected.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.440]   And this is the key.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.360]   I want to say this several times.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:04.320]   It's a single source of truth.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.760]   One page, your Monday.com page, it's a single source of truth.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:11.280]   You won't check in meetings anymore.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:20.360]   And if you do data driven decisions, no more guessing, you have this single source of truth.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.640]   All the information you need is in there.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.720]   In whatever form you like, by the way, you like Gantt charts, they can do that.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.600]   Timelines, can ban boards.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.440]   You can use tables.
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:31.440]   Monday.com has everything.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.600]   They have remote ready templates because they know people are working remotely nowadays
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.160]   so you can get your team up to speed instantly.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.840]   And they have great onboarding specialists like Eddie, the one we worked with.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.200]   He helped us set up that podcast board.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:48.680]   By the way, they already had a podcast template so it was very easy.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:52.160]   No matter what business you're in, the templates are there.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:59.080]   You can increase productivity and efficiency, facilitate transparency, improve collaboration.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.640]   There's even no code automations so you can put your team's workflow on autopilot.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.760]   You don't have to manually enter data and it just goes, flows in there from their natural
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.440]   work.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.520]   You've got alerts, you have automatic status updates, project flows to keep your team
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.480]   on track and confident in their work.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:22.760]   I think this is an amazing solution that works with the tools you're already using to give
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.440]   you a single source of truth.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.000]   A place on the web you can go to, you can look and you can say, "Here's where we are.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.400]   Here's where we are this minute, right up to this minute."
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:36.640]   No wonder over a hundred thousand teams are already getting things done with Monday.com.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.040]   They are amazing.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:43.040]   Monday.com can take care of what slows you down, free you up to do the things you got
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.720]   into the business for in the first place.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.960]   The stuff that really juices you up makes you feel good.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:54.760]   That was nit, you know, picky little, what do you do, you know, meetings.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.080]   You don't even need them to do them anymore.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.880]   It's all there right there in front of you.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.080]   Change the way you work online.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.720]   I'll tell you what, don't take my word for it.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.240]   We've got a free two week trial for you.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.440]   Go to monday.com/twit.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:13.080]   You'll really be up and running in minutes so you can really get a sense of it.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.640]   And I have a feeling you're going to want to spend more and more time with it.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.160]   You're going to just really love it.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.160]   monday.com/twit.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:24.040]   Thank you, monday.com, for your support of this week in Google helping us get the job
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.040]   done.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.080]   I want to mention, you know, we do, as you all know, we've done Host Red ads.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.760]   That's what they call these things, where I or our hosts, Aunt Micah, Jason Howell will
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:38.200]   read an ad in the show.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.160]   But some of our shows during, because of COVID have not been sold out.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:47.320]   And maybe some of you have noticed, in fact, maybe some of you have been shocked by, because
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.280]   I'm getting some emails from people saying, "Hey, I was listening to Twig or one of our
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.400]   other shows," because we're doing it on a number of shows now, "I was listening to Twig."
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.440]   And all of a sudden there was an ad for, you know, another podcast in there.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.440]   Who put that in there?
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.800]   That is something we're trying out.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.400]   It's called direct ad insertion.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:11.840]   We use a company, really, I think a good company called Megaphone, and they will sell ads and
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.840]   insert them.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.120]   Some of them are Host Red.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.680]   They might be me doing those ads.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.160]   Some of them are not.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.200]   Some of them, you know, are sponsors you've not heard before.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.440]   So don't be shocked if you hear that.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440]   That's normal.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:29.680]   It's one of the ways we're trying to keep the lights on during a difficult time, because
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.760]   as I'm sure you know, times are tough right now.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.920]   A lot of businesses are struggling, advertising dollars off by, I don't know, 30, 40 percent,
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:39.920]   a significant amount.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.480]   I don't know exactly what it is.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.760]   So it's costing us a little bit of money, but we want to try to keep the lights on as
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.760]   best we can.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.760]   So if you hear that...
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.760]   So think of it as a surprise.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.760]   Jesus Christ.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.760]   I wonder what ad I'm going to get this time.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.800]   Maybe I should listen to the podcast again and again and again and see over 10 times,
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:56.800]   what ads do I get?
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.800]   That would be a lot of fun.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.800]   Exactly.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.800]   I'm not sure which way.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:00.800]   Right.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.240]   Now, it will not be in the video versions.
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.920]   It's not in the live versions, obviously, because it's done after the fact.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.360]   It's only in the audio versions of this show.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.800]   We try to do it in such a way.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.440]   And this is the trick for us.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:17.960]   And I've been struggling with this a little bit so that I indicate there's a pause here.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.680]   But for those of you watching video, we continue on.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.280]   It's not like what happened.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:28.680]   So well, you'll see after the change log, I'll do another one.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:34.000]   And you'll see, I'll say something like coming up next, it's our picks of the week.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   Pause.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.400]   And now Stacey was kicking us off.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.400]   See, I don't think it's...
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.520]   I've been trying to talk to this.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.880]   I think you can have another way because when it's coming up next sounds like it's coming
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.600]   up to a commercial, which you don't really have to say.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.480]   Well, I can't wait to hear Stacey's picks.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.480]   Pause.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.680]   Stacey, what are your picks?
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.680]   Okay.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.680]   Right?
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.680]   It works as a tease.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.680]   And...
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.080]   We're struggling with it.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.080]   Transitional statements.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.560]   Because it has to be enough of a transitional statement so that people don't go, "Whoa,
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.360]   I just got hit by an ad."
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.120]   Like, I want to warn you.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.120]   Right, I know.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:08.760]   But I don't want to confuse you if there's no ad.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.160]   So I don't know what the answer is on this.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.120]   Does that's been my experience with other podcasts that I listened to that use a similar
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.120]   service.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:19.280]   I don't know if they're particularly using a megaphone, but it would just be a jarring
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.400]   break with those sort of transition or anything.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:28.200]   At least you tried to transition to it somewhere within the show.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.360]   But not everybody's savvy as you are.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:37.800]   Well, and obviously it's not working completely because I'm getting email in our Twitter community.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.040]   People are mentioning it.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.840]   And they're like, "I don't...
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:41.840]   What happened?"
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.000]   What the hell's going on?
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   Somebody...
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.760]   A guy just posted...
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.720]   I thought I suddenly got another podcast playing.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:53.120]   And partly that's because for 15 years, the only ads you've heard on Twitter are me reading
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.120]   those ads.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.120]   Right.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.840]   So that's probably some of it.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.360]   So that's why I'm even bringing it up, otherwise I wouldn't.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:06.280]   But I just to prepare you to understand that just like on network television or radio where
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.400]   you know, shows going along and then there's an ad that has nothing to do with the show
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.680]   or the host or anything, and then it comes back.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.880]   That's how media was sold for years.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.320]   We did something, we started doing something very different, which was every ad was kind
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:23.000]   of woven into the content and the hosts read it.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.480]   And I would like to keep doing it that way, but apparently it's...
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:27.480]   Indeed.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:31.440]   It's not good enough for all of you.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.440]   And we'll see.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.440]   This is an experiment.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.120]   If people really hate it, you know, we can turn the lights off.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.120]   I don't...
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.120]   Then you couldn't do...
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.480]   Yeah, you could turn the lights off or put up a paywall.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.800]   I don't think we'll ever do a paywall.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.000]   Although, did you see?
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.760]   So we used to have a young couple lives up the road apiece come in.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.280]   They were on YouTube.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.840]   They were a wonderful little group called Pamplamoose.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.600]   They'd come in, they'd play music.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.600]   I just really love them.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.640]   Jack Conte and his girlfriend.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   They were so good.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:01.640]   Now wife.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.640]   Their wife, did they get married?
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.640]   All right.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   Well, you had to get married.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.720]   And they were just a durable couple and I loved their music and they'd come and perform
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.720]   for us.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:14.120]   And then the Jack, because he's a YouTube guy and actually they did...
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:19.320]   I think the thing that was an epiphany for him is they did a tour, a concert tour and
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.280]   they lost money like crazy.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.080]   Well, he wrote a post about it.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.080]   He didn't...
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.440]   I think he kind of broke even within a dollar or something.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.200]   It was just clearly not worth it.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.120]   And everybody says, "This is how performers are going to make money now, not through
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.080]   selling records, but through touring."
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.080]   And he said, "Here's...
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.080]   I'll give you the...
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080]   He was very transparent.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.080]   He said, "I'll give you all the numbers."
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:44.080]   And the media post, Pamplamoo's 2014 tour profits.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.360]   They finished a 28-day tour, 24 shows, 23 cities.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:54.040]   Natalie, his wife, now wife, who was just a wonderful singer and he's performing.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.040]   She is.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.200]   She crowd-served for the first time ever.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:03.600]   We sold under $100,000 in tickets, $1,129 tickets in San Francisco at the Fillmore.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:07.160]   I'll never forget that night for the rest of my life.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   One question fans repeatedly asked, "What does it feel like to have made it as a band?"
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.080]   Here's the van.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.960]   There was expenses.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:27.000]   So they paid the band's week of salaries for musicians, tour budget.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.880]   The tour ended up costing us.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:37.120]   Now remember what they made on the tour, $100,000 in tickets, tour ending up costing us $147,000
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.200]   and $802.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:46.240]   So it was, I think, an epiphany for Jack.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.480]   You know what?
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.580]   We are so thrilled.
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:50.880]   We loved seeing our fans.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:55.760]   This is an amazing event, but it's not a way to make a living.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.480]   They lost $11,819.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.480]   They lost $11,000.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.120]   But boy, are they a great band.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:14.000]   So Jack thought, "Well, what if I made it possible for bands and others to raise money
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   in another way?"
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.840]   He fatted something a little thing you might have heard of.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.520]   It might have heard of it called Patreon.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.200]   Patreon, what's that?
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.680]   Patreon just got its second round of funding.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:33.440]   I don't know if they make money actually, but I guess in this day and age it doesn't matter
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.200]   if you make money.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.200]   But they got their second round.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.520]   That until a couple of years after your IPO.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:45.120]   They are now worth $1.2 billion.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.400]   So yeah, they lost $11,000 on that tour.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:51.240]   But it was an expensive education.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.760]   But you know what?
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:55.160]   Credit to Jack and Natalie.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.800]   And Jack, you know what?
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   This is killing me.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.480]   Because I brought Jack to New York for an event on membership and news.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:06.000]   And one of the people I brought is now the president of WNYC in New York, Goldie Schickell
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.520]   and Slummy.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.280]   And so they met that way.
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.520]   And she's on his board.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.080]   I wanted to be on his board.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.880]   I have so that's stock.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.880]   Oh, yes.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.880]   Well, congratulations.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.280]   But Jack's great.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.280]   Because he wants to support creativity.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.120]   That's what he cares about.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.760]   And it's been a great success.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.280]   And so their second-- or actually, it's not second.
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:35.840]   Their series e-funding of $90 million values, them at $1.2 billion.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:43.720]   They have raised, for creators, $2 billion, six million patrons.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.480]   And many of our friends, as a matter of fact, are on Patreon.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.360]   So well done, Jack.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360]   That's really great.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360]   That's really--
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.600]   And the great thing is they both still do music.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   Pamplemoost.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600]   I think they're a studio.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.680]   I think they kind of separated out.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.680]   I think they live in San Francisco.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.240]   And their studio is in LA or something like that.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.080]   And they were separating out the two lives.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.080]   But they still do that.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.080]   Oh, that's too bad.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.240]   Yeah, they probably have a nice big mansion now.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:06.240]   They used to live up the road.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.240]   I see now.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.840]   This is when they need to ask, what's it feel like to have made it?
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.840]   That's when they asked.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.920]   I mean, literally, they lived like--
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.280]   They'll never feels like they made it.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.120]   No.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:20.120]   You can lose that money any time, right?
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.600]   So they've raised a total of $255 million to date.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.840]   Isn't that great?
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.800]   It's good for them.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.640]   That's good stuff.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.080]   A big success story.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:31.240]   Nice, nice people.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.800]   It's so nice.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:33.880]   I just love them.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.640]   I just love them.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.720]   And I first discovered them.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:39.680]   They were on a Christmas, I think, Nissan commercial.
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.320]   Oh.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:45.320]   And they were just this really cute couple with nice singing.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.200]   And they were just fun at it.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.640]   I wonder if you can find it online.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.400]   I'm sure I can.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.640]   And I don't think--
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.560]   Hyundai.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.560]   Hyundai.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.080]   Well, that's good.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.600]   The couple moves deck the halls, Hyundai.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:04.760]   And I don't think Hyundai would mind if we play this, would they?
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.960]   Carson's screaming right now.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:06.480]   We're fine.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.360]   Scream, Carson, scream.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.440]   Take it down.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.720]   What do we care?
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:16.280]   This is-- now you'll know why everybody loves Jack and Natalie.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:20.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:26.280]   They also made amazing videos.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.280]   Right?
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.280]   Yes, all phenomenal.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.440]   Offering you a great deal on the 2011 Genesis
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.560]   is one of ours.
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:38.760]   Now, during Hyundai holidays, you can lease the 2011 Genesis.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.280]   So you'd never seen him when you saw this Genesis set in 2010.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.400]   This is how I saw the rest of it.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.480]   I said, no, it was actually was not this one, exactly.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.400]   It was another one.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.520]   But the music was good, and they were really cute and fun.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.200]   And I just looked them up.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.240]   And--
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.080]   Let me play.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.880]   I'm always amused by people who act in commercials who
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.800]   are actually likable and good.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.320]   And sometimes I look up at who is that person.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.280]   And so I saw I looked them up and found them.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.440]   And so yeah, I started following him, them, long before.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.720]   We should try to get--
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:15.440]   I know I think we are trying to get them on one of the shows,
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:18.120]   or at least Jack just to say congratulations.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.840]   Here to give you a better idea.
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.240]   Because one of the things that she's famous for
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.240]   is their covers.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.680]   They do great covers.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:27.960]   Here's a song you might know, a Pamplamos cover
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.000]   from a few years ago, 3.2 million views on this.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.240]   And that's Jack on the drums, Pian.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.400]   He does all the instruments.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:45.440]   Natalie does this singing.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.040]   She plays the instruments to it.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:55.600]   And the thing is, they would do these out of their living room.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.960]   I mean, this was done in the house.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:57.960]   Oh, yes.
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.320]   They would cut the heck out of them.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.760]   Oh, my god.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.040]   Yeah, Jack told me the editing was hell.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.560]   Oh, man.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.000]   You did one with a robot.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.600]   Post is always the hard part.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:12.840]   Yeah, post is the worst.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.760]   Actually, I thought they were the next big thing.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:24.480]   I actually was shocked that they didn't become huge.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.160]   But that's maybe more about the music industry
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:28.400]   than anything else.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.840]   I think so.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.080]   Anyway.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.400]   Anyway, I didn't know that news.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.240]   That's good news for them.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.240]   Yeah, isn't that?
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:36.680]   I hope--
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.040]   I know this is last week's news,
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.760]   but this still made me think about Spotify and Joe Budd
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.720]   and when you're talking about this story here with them
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.080]   being in the music industry and how much money they could have
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.040]   potentially made versus what they actually lost when it comes
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.560]   to all of the hidden fees and hidden costs.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:56.560]   And it spends this--
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.080]   tend to show up last week on Tech News Weekly.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:04.520]   We talked about Joe Budd and a pretty popular rapper
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.320]   from about 10 years ago, who is big in the entertainment
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.840]   industry now with podcasts and so forth.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:14.120]   But he learned a lot of lessons from being in music.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.560]   And it pretty much has led to him saying,
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.640]   we're done with Spotify being on their platform
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.000]   for our podcasts exclusively.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.360]   Because I know what it takes.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.200]   And I know how much money is coming in.
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.600]   I understand my value.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.640]   I understand the growth and all that.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:34.280]   And Spotify is just going to take us and rip us apart.
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.520]   And we're not going to own the content.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.440]   And I mean, he's speaking as a heart at the heart of a creator,
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.120]   not necessarily as a business person.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.120]   Well, OK.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.120]   Also, he says Spotify promised us bonuses
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.320]   when we got to a certain size.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.160]   And he says, his show exceeded Spotify's audience
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:59.760]   reach expectations by 900% to the point
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.760]   that his listeners crashed the platform.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.280]   And he says, but we never got a bonus.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.120]   The company wouldn't allow him and his team
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.720]   to take vacation days on Christmas and New Year's.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.080]   Joe, if you worked for us, you could take Christmas
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.080]   and New Year's out.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.320]   Because that would have required them to miss two episodes
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.040]   of the podcast.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.320]   The company did give them Rolexes.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:22.640]   Joe, I'll give you a time X. It's just the same.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:25.240]   It's just the same.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.080]   But then--
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:27.200]   It's even waterproof.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.840]   Then it was worse because Joe and his team picked out
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:34.840]   Rolexes and Spotify said, those are too expensive.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.000]   Then he said, well, Spotify, give money
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.720]   to our fans for Christmas instead of Rolexes
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.880]   and Spotify said no.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.800]   He said, this was the first time a dawn on me
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.120]   that Spotify is pillaging.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.840]   You pillage the audience from the podcast
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.040]   and you've continued to pillage each step of the way
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:54.160]   without any regard for the fans.
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.680]   I wonder how much money Spotify gave them up front.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:00.280]   You know, the rumor is they gave Joe Rogan $100 million
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.240]   over several years to go exclusively--
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.240]   Right.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.680]   --taking his YouTube audience and his podcast audience
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.000]   exclusively to Spotify.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.840]   Don't they have Michelle Obama?
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.480]   They have Michelle Obama, that's right.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:15.320]   But the details with Rogan was that he was so adamant about
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:19.640]   was Rogan is still going to own the art that they're creating.
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.920]   It's still going to be his.
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.520]   Spotify is not going to have all of it.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:27.920]   And I think that's the big piece that Joe Button has been
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.960]   fighting.
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.680]   They're doing all of this work and creating this content
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:37.120]   and Spotify and those folks are like, yeah, if you leave,
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.600]   this is still ours.
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:39.800]   Well, I'm going to defend--
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:42.000]   because we would assert the same thing.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.920]   So it started with the nod.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:52.600]   Brittany Luce and Eric Eddings created the podcast for Gimlet.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:56.680]   And then Gimlet was acquired by Spotify.
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.040]   And Brittany and Eric said, well, we built the show
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.000]   in the audience, but we don't own it.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.760]   Well, I got to tell you, Ant, if you
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.800]   build a show in an audience on our network
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.800]   and then you decide to leave, you don't take the show with you
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.280]   unless we--
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.960]   No, no, I get that.
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.480]   Dad, I get because if something--
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.160]   if I ended up leaving Twitter, I can't take hands-on
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:16.920]   photography with you.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.400]   Well, we own it because we put a lot on--
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.880]   I don't own my rants.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.200]   I thought I own my rants.
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.640]   And now to be fair--
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.840]   To be fair, every single time that's happened,
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.080]   we've said, OK, go ahead.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.160]   I haven't been happy about it.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:35.360]   Chad Johnson did that great Minecraft OMG Craft podcast
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.920]   on our network, built a great YouTube audience.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:40.280]   We built him a beautiful set and all that stuff.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:45.400]   And at some point, he said, yeah, I'm making a lot of money
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:45.680]   now.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.440]   Can I just have it and do it my own--
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.560]   and any other company in the world would have said, no,
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:53.680]   we own the IP, the intellectual property to this.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.360]   You made this as an employee.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:01.240]   But we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on it.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.440]   But I'm not that guy.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:03.640]   So I said, no, go ahead.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:04.520]   And he's doing great.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:08.280]   He's actually broke a million subscribers just the other day.
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:12.640]   The difference there, though, is Joe Budden already had millions
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:12.640]   of them.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:13.880]   Well, the nod didn't.
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.360]   The nod didn't.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.360]   Joe Budden did.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.920]   So I don't know.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.160]   I know that happened with the nod.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.240]   I don't know what the deal was with Joe Budden.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.840]   Did he say--
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:29.400]   I think he is taking it with him.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.840]   Yeah, he is.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:34.240]   They're cutting ties.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.040]   But to be on that platform, there
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.280]   were some other things that he wanted to happen.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.080]   The company wanted him to read ads.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.480]   He said, no.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.840]   He was like, no, I'm not reading ads.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.280]   Making it one of the only shows not to be monetized
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.520]   on the platform.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.120]   Well, again, it's just a premium for the world.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.200]   There's a lot of people in the world
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.960]   for the monthly Spotify subscription
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.560]   to not get ads when you pay for Spotify premium.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:01.760]   But you're still going to have ads inserted
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.000]   on those certain exclusives--
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.040]   And on the free tier you have ads,
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.840]   because that's the only way they think, oh my god,
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.360]   that's not cool.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.920]   Well, OK.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:14.840]   There are a lot of creatives in the world who think, oh, you
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:18.120]   know, I mean, I've been on both sides.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:20.080]   I mean, I've made all these shows.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.440]   So I've been on both sides.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.000]   But I've always known 40 years in the business
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.040]   that when you create as an employee,
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.840]   that company owns what you create.
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.320]   I don't own the screensavers.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.240]   I don't own call for help.
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.400]   And I would never even have thought in my head, oh,
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.640]   I want to take that with me.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.080]   You owe it to me.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:42.840]   Or I'm never doing ads because you understand it's a business.
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:48.040]   I thought it was a fast match.
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:54.520]   Now, as a creator, I will say, like, would giga-home
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.720]   went away.
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:59.640]   Suddenly, I lost all of my--
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:00.480]   oh, what was it?
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:03.840]   All the IOT podcast that Kevin had done on that one.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.360]   So when I moved to--
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.000]   So you were doing it for giga-home?
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.320]   You were doing it for giga-home.
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:08.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.320]   We were.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:13.000]   And it was called the giga-home IOT podcast.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.240]   So after that failed about a week and a half or two weeks
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.680]   later, I was like, Kevin, do you want to start out up again?
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.000]   You know, and we still didn't know what we were going to do.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:21.520]   And he was like, sure.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.360]   Thank you for that.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:23.840]   That's all.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.440]   So yeah, we can't go in.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.040]   And we've done that with other shows.
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.000]   When Scott Wilkinson, we had a--
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.600]   that show wasn't making a lot of money.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.240]   And we couldn't afford to do it anymore.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.720]   I said, Scott, we'll give you the feed.
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:36.240]   We'll give you the-- you have the name, whatever you want to do.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.880]   If you want to do it, he went to a couple of publishers.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.440]   Nobody else picked it up.
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:45.240]   We've done that almost every time when Tom Merritt used
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.680]   to do a show for us.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.840]   He wanted a lot of money.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.640]   He hired an agent.
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.160]   That was a mistake, by the way.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.320]   He hired an agent.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:58.960]   And the agent said, I think he wanted a triple Tom's salary.
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.720]   And he wants to do less.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.280]   And so we just didn't renew the contract.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.400]   We couldn't come to terms.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.720]   The guy said, no, no, you got to give him $350,000 a year.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:08.160]   And I said, I don't make that kind of money.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.760]   I'm sorry, I can't.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.000]   So we didn't renew his contract.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.320]   But we left on good terms.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.040]   And he continued to the daily tech news.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.880]   He didn't get TNT, the name Tech News today,
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:23.160]   because that was ours, and we continued to do that show.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.440]   But he went and did the daily tech news show.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.240]   And you've been on it a lot of people.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.000]   You could have signed him to a non-compete, and you didn't.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.360]   I've never done that.
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:32.600]   Partly because non-compete.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:33.360]   I know.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:34.360]   Look it.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:37.640]   As I have signed non-competes in my lifetime,
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:40.480]   all of them unenforceable in California.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.160]   But I've signed them many times.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.440]   And see, I come from both sides of the track.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.760]   But at the same time, that's like, I understand you can't--
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.200]   I'm not going to take the call for help show with me.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:51.920]   It's not mine.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:59.120]   So I was going to say that when I went to "Fortune,"
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:02.080]   I actually offered them the show,
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.480]   because they wanted to do podcasts.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.680]   But they didn't want to do my show.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.240]   So they were fine with me doing it,
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:12.120]   but they didn't want it.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:14.440]   And then when they did want it, they decided they wanted it.
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.320]   But then they wanted to own the licensing.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.720]   And I was like, oh, no, thank you.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.320]   Come to think--
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.000]   And that was just like a no-go for them.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.520]   The chatroom is bringing up all these shows that we said, OK,
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.920]   fine, keep your show.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.120]   I'm an idiot.
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.600]   What was I thinking?
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.640]   I just can't do that to somebody.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.400]   Well, we were going to do a show out of the school, right?
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.240]   And we tried to figure out how to do a twit-worthy show out
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:39.640]   of the school.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:42.080]   And I couldn't, which is just to say, folks, it's hard.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.440]   It's very hard.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.040]   That's the thing.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:49.560]   I think a lot of talent doesn't really understand
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:54.160]   all of the money and time and effort we put into this stuff.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:54.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.800]   And so--
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:03.560]   Oh, I was just like, and it's not enough to be talent.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:07.560]   You have to also have the brain and add smarts too,
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.720]   which is tough to find in the same person.
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.200]   That's why, honestly, when OMG craft, when Chad did so well
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:17.640]   that I was thrilled for him, I was really thrilled for him.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.760]   And you know what's great?
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:21.400]   We stopped doing the giz whiz with Dick D. Bartolo.
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.760]   But I said, Dick, please take it, take the feed, whatever you want.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:26.400]   And he and Chad got together and they still do that show.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.360]   So I'm an idiot.
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:33.200]   No, but I understand Joe's point of view,
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.760]   but I also understand Spotify's point of view.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.200]   And it sounds like--
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.040]   he refused to do ads.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.320]   And it sounds like Spotify has said, OK, Joe,
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.040]   but we're going to keep the show.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.040]   They--
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:50.480]   Spotify said they wanted to keep button on the platform.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.000]   As Joe referenced in a show, he made him a considerable offer,
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.200]   one that was significantly larger.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.360]   Many times the value of the existing agreement
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:00.400]   reflective of the current market and the size of his audience.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.480]   Unfortunately, we couldn't come to terms.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:05.920]   And we respect his wishes to find a new home for his show.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.920]   Yeah, I believe that the argument was the offer you're
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.000]   giving me right now is just not quite good enough.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.440]   Because I know what my trajectory is.
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:22.400]   Well, I could see what my trajectory is based on my past.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.680]   We're continuing to pick up steam.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:27.280]   And we're going to continue to bring more to the table
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.360]   to the umbrella of Spotify.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.920]   So he's saying, hey, give me a little more cash and we're in.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.280]   And of course, they just couldn't meet up.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.080]   So I see it--
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.720]   just like you, I see it on both sides.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.200]   I thought it was a good discussion.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.320]   I'm not that fond of Joe doing it.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.480]   He was the first to do an exclusive deal.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.720]   It was Spotify.
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.480]   And I don't like these exclusive deals.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:52.920]   I don't like what Joe Rogan's done either because I think
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.760]   it's giving Spotify a huge amount of power.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:02.160]   And what Spotify is trying to do is to kill RSS podcasting
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.920]   and to make podcasting be something that lives on an
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:07.800]   application so they can gather more information about you.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.000]   And we really don't-- I don't think that's the right thing
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:10.800]   to do.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.680]   So in a way, if Joe wants to leave, that's fine.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:17.920]   He kind of made a deal that I didn't really support to begin
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.800]   with, same thing with Rogan.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:22.720]   I hope both of these guys cash in.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.160]   And maybe I'll have money.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.880]   I think there's more about the capitalistic side of it too,
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:26.880]   though.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:27.800]   And maybe--
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.840]   let's see what Joe Button does.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.920]   He brought a name.
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:35.560]   He was a success going into it.
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:38.840]   So that's what he was taking here.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.600]   It's not just some average person going into these
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:43.400]   negotiations.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.320]   This is someone that has some sort of establishment with them.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.440]   But apparently did not have enough cloud to convince
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:49.680]   Spotify.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:51.040]   All right.
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:51.680]   So that's always--
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.080]   I don't know who he is.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.320]   Yeah, I didn't know he was.
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:57.400]   I'm not a big hip-hop artist like I was
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.640]   umpteen years ago.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:00.960]   But I knew of his name.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:02.120]   I didn't listen to any of the music.
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.240]   You were a hip-hop artist?
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:07.440]   You did a bunch of other different things beyond music,
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.120]   far as being in a community and just doing things
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:10.640]   at business.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:15.120]   It does something called calming rap, where it's very relaxed.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.480]   Is it a little hip-hop beats?
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:19.960]   No, seriously.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.960]   What the hell?
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:24.280]   Were you a hip-hop artist?
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.240]   Is that true?
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.240]   No.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.000]   Never.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.800]   I was really excited by this whole--
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.360]   I was--
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:31.920]   I was--
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:32.560]   My name's--
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.560]   Never been that cool.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:34.680]   That is aunt.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:41.440]   And I'm here to say, I came to spit and not to play.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:44.320]   I'd like to do my rap for you.
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.880]   Like that, right?
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:46.880]   That would be no say.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:50.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.000]   It's ASMR rap.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.320]   It's a whole new thing.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:54.520]   It's a new category.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:58.120]   It's sensual melodic rap, according to chicken rap.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.600]   Right, right.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.960]   So I think it's interesting to watch this.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:05.960]   When money comes into a business--
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.800]   podcasting never was worth anything--
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.120]   when money comes into a business, it changes, boy.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:12.000]   Does it change?
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.840]   You watch this thing happen.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.280]   And Spotify has signed, yes.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:19.240]   Joe Rogan, Michelle Obama, Kim Kardashian.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:22.680]   I mean, they're trying to build this exclusive thing.
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:24.240]   And they bought Gimlet.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:27.280]   They've spent more than half a billion dollars.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:29.000]   And I'm just bitter because they didn't buy us.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.320]   That's all.
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:31.960]   I'll be honest with you.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.440]   The truth comes out.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.040]   Audible is now trying to pump up its podcast now.
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:36.560]   Yes.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:37.080]   You're right.
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:38.560]   When money comes in, it changes everything.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.320]   And when it leaves, it changes everything.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.440]   Yeah, I'm waiting till it leaves.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.800]   I'll be here to pick up the pieces.
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:45.920]   No, and that's interesting.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.320]   Audible doesn't want any podcast with ads.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.280]   And it makes sense because their books don't have ads either.
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.240]   Right.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.920]   But that leaves us out because that's
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.040]   how we make money doing the show.
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:00.540]   Right.
[01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:02.280]   So what else do podcasts do?
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:04.000]   Do they just have--
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.040]   Well, some people are happy to be--
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:05.800]   Is it like Patreon?
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:08.360]   I'm just happy to be Audible.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:09.720]   I guess.
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.200]   I don't know.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:15.200]   So you have to make-- I mean, how do they feed their families?
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.840]   See, that's the fundamental question.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.600]   Patreon and--
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:19.600]   I'm not-- I mean, I'm not--
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:19.720]   I mean, I'm not--
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:21.120]   --in the face, I guess.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.120]   Well, my friend Pete Dominic--
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.400]   Yeah, because I'm not in the series.
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:25.400]   But I do want to feed my family.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.000]   Yeah, right.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.880]   Yeah, well, my friend Pete Dominic, who
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:31.080]   was on Sirius, who's a stand-up comedian
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:31.880]   and has a political show.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:33.000]   He did it on Sirius for a long time,
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.680]   built a channel for them, basically.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:35.800]   So he left Sirius.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:36.640]   And now he's in a shed.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.480]   He's in a he shed.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:39.800]   And his backyard doing his podcast is going really well.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:41.240]   And he's doing it mainly on Patreon.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:42.200]   Good for him.
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.480]   That's awesome.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.160]   I've thought, you know, advertising--
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:51.760]   I think when I retire, I'll do a Patreon podcast.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:54.760]   I can't go to Patreon for shows that we've
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:55.800]   been giving away for free.
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.280]   You can't do that.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.920]   Nobody-- you would get more support--
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.720]   fan support than your money on.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:05.720]   I don't know.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:07.280]   I really know about that.
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:07.960]   But I--
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:08.460]   I know.
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.760]   --I think it would have cost me, man.
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.520]   Well, no, I mean, people are so fickle.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:14.520]   People are--
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:17.280]   All right, so we put this show out,
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.440]   along with all of our other gazillion shows
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:21.520]   we have on the network for free.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:25.880]   We just insert our own personal ad reads into them
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.080]   here and there.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.880]   And people will bitch in complaining
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.560]   about some of those ad reads, even though they didn't pay
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.960]   a dime for the content.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.000]   No, and I think that a lot of people say, oh,
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.960]   I'd pay $5 a month.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:42.240]   But when push comes to shove, I don't know if they don't.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:42.800]   They do not.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:44.600]   I don't--
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.160]   This might--
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.400]   And that's why it's going to be when I retire,
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.160]   so that it's not like, well, I have
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.560]   to make a certain amount of money.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:52.680]   I just want to keep talking.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.640]   And if it'd be nice, if I could make a little money,
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:57.120]   I'd do it.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.680]   People have been very generous with us.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:01.120]   I have to say, we sold a quarter million dollars
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.880]   worth of bricks to build the brick house.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.440]   Somebody's reminded me of that.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:06.280]   That was amazing.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:08.800]   When we started, we asked for tips.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:13.680]   And we were routinely doing $8,000 or $9,000 a month in tips.
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.160]   And not to mention, seven Bitcoin, which some--
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:17.800]   Somewhere.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:19.680]   Somewhere, I will get it.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.640]   And actually, I think it's now technically--
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.120]   I think Florence Ianoans my Bitcoin.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:25.120]   Oh, and that's right.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.120]   That's right.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:26.120]   She does.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.120]   She won it, fair and square.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:32.320]   Hey, by the way, we should mention,
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:35.120]   even though we have debated back and forth
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.200]   about whether TikTok and WeChat should
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.400]   be banned in the US, of course, as we know,
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.640]   Twitter and Facebook are banned in China, India has now added--
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:45.640]   they banned TikTok a while ago.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:50.240]   A lot of Chinese apps, they have now added 118 apps to that list,
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:55.080]   including the game that is now taking Fortnite's place
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.800]   on iOS, PubG Mobile, banned.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:03.400]   I didn't realize PubG Mobile was owned by a Chinese company.
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.640]   I didn't know that either.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.280]   Tencent.
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.440]   You've heard of them?
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.200]   They own PubG Mobile.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:16.200]   It was, according to many, the most popular game in India
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.440]   prior to the ban.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:20.800]   So that is a government-- Modi's government says, fine,
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:21.640]   who cares?
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.680]   We're banning it.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:27.160]   TikTok, one of the most successful markets for TikTok
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.880]   was India until it was banned in June.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.720]   So do we want to be like India and just ban stuff we don't like?
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:36.600]   I don't think so.
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.600]   No.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.600]   Well, because we-- again--
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.160]   Are we trying to charge the price?
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:43.960]   No, that's right.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:46.440]   Well, I don't know.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:49.240]   There are people who say, look how China's treating its weaker
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.400]   Muslim minority.
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.880]   That's a good reason not to have any Chinese commerce
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:56.240]   in this country, right?
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:00.440]   Oh, if we apply their jerks to some people argument
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:03.040]   to why we shouldn't have Chinese businesses here,
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.320]   we have got to clean our own house first.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.840]   We're putting kids in cages.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.440]   And we're shooting--
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:11.280]   Ooh, black men on the streets.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.280]   And--
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.280]   Perice.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:18.280]   Yeah, I agree with--
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:22.520]   Yoast living in glass houses should refrain from casting golders.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:27.080]   Let's do--
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:30.080]   did we talk about Neuralink last week?
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:31.280]   No, we didn't.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.280]   All right.
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:37.080]   And Elon Musk, who's read a lot of science fiction as have I,
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:41.160]   wants to live in a world where you can jack in a mind machine
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:41.680]   interface.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:43.320]   You've got a little thing on the back of your head.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:46.320]   You just connect the computer and you're in the metaverse.
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.040]   And Neuralink is a company he's funded
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:53.000]   to the tune of $100 million to create this next generation
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.800]   brain machine interface.
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:56.440]   And ladies and gentlemen, would you
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:00.720]   put your head in that thing?
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:02.040]   Because that's what it involves.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:06.680]   This is actually a concept, an automated surgeon
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.320]   that-- well, it drills a little hole in your skin,
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.160]   just a little one, just a little quarter size.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.400]   You drill holes in the ground, you can
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.400]   roll holes in your head.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:14.400]   Right.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.400]   You have the same skill.
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:17.160]   It's the same boring machine.
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:19.440]   It's like economists are doing epidemiology.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.560]   You know, it's not hard to pick up.
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.480]   They place in your--
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:24.840]   so they take a little bit of the skull out.
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:25.920]   They'll put it back.
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:26.800]   Promise.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.680]   Take a little bit of the skull out.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.560]   Put like a cellophane-like membrane in there.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.400]   And it has electrodes, thousand electrodes,
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:37.400]   the diameter of a quarter of the diameter of a human hair,
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.440]   very thin.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:40.920]   And it plunges them into your brain
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.720]   at different depths and locations, avoiding--
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:46.040]   very important-- avoiding the blood cells,
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.040]   because if you hit a blood cell, well, it makes a mess.
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:52.000]   And the machine can do six threads
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.560]   with 192 electrodes every minute.
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:57.440]   So it's like a little sewing machine for your brain.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.640]   So it takes a little hole that goes,
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:02.400]   puts those in there, closes you up,
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:05.320]   and now you have a neural link in there.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:06.880]   And this is the best part.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.640]   You pair it to your smartphone via Bluetooth.
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:11.520]   Really?
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.720]   Yeah, too.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.720]   Yes.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:17.320]   And now, let's be frank.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.760]   This demo didn't, in fact, they didn't do it to humans.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:21.440]   And they haven't even built this machine.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.680]   They did it to a pig.
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:25.200]   Actually, they did it to a couple of pigs.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.000]   They had-- I'm not sure why they had three.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.760]   They had a control pig.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:29.480]   They had the pig.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:30.480]   They did the surgery on it.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.720]   And then they just had some third pig just hanging around
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.160]   to keep everybody else company.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:40.800]   Here is the neural link reading the pig's brain activity
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:44.520]   and predicting its limb motions ahead of time.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:47.160]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:51.040]   Isn't that mind boggling?
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.480]   But let me ask you.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:53.480]   Yes.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:57.040]   You asked if we would connect ourselves to this device.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:58.040]   I'm not going to answer that.
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:49:59.440]   You're going to put your head in there.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.160]   Because I want you to answer it first.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:03.160]   Would you do this in 2022, if this device--
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.440]   No, no, no, no.
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:09.000]   But I would do it 10 years.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:09.600]   OK.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:11.240]   I'll do it in 2030.
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:13.640]   So you're saying, give it time to mature?
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.080]   Well, yeah.
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.640]   And also, at that point, I'll be so old that if it kills me,
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.480]   it's not the end of the world.
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.280]   Well, it's the end of my world.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:25.160]   But I'll be like, OK, I'm going to take a chance.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:25.960]   I'm going to leave it.
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.440]   Oh my god, it's for science.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.640]   It's like, if you ask me, will you go to Mars
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.400]   and there's no return trip?
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.600]   I do that now.
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:33.760]   I've lived a good life.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.080]   You know, I'll have some fun on Mars.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:38.160]   Do we get Stacey back?
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.360]   We lost Stacey briefly.
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.520]   I think her internet is just really crapping out.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.520]   It's supposed to cut--
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:45.040]   It's supposed to cut--
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:46.320]   --saw on those, not the internet.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.120]   I've always wanted-- see, I am not
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:51.680]   happy with the VR glasses, the VR helmet.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:55.120]   I have always wanted to get in the metaverse.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:58.640]   I want it to be so realistic that I think I'm there.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:01.400]   If they told me that we could do that tomorrow,
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.880]   but you've got to do this procedure,
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:04.880]   I probably would do it.
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:05.880]   Don't you would see--
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:06.880]   Do you like that?
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:07.880]   You won't be on the lines--
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.160]   --of your head to--
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.520]   --reel-bite you on my--
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:11.520]   --of your hands.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.520]   What the hell?
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:15.520]   What the hell?
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:19.520]   Are you fucking fucks?
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:22.160]   That's kind of-- that should be on my tombstone.
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:24.520]   He wouldn't be on Facebook, but he would let
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.960]   Elon Musk drill his brain.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.480]   Oh, I thought it was going to be, are you knocking fucks?
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:33.440]   But I think that might be on the--
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:35.760]   --both of those, either one of those.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:39.400]   So Stacey, I'm glad we got you back, because I think you
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:43.000]   probably, of all of us, have the best understanding
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.560]   of the brain, machine, interface.
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:48.320]   Well, Stacey's going to turn herself into an IoT.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.320]   No.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:53.480]   No, so I would never do this, although--
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:58.280]   I don't think the risk versus the reward here is compelling.
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:01.600]   And I say that because the ability to access information
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.840]   is going to become less valuable over time.
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.440]   And that's basically what this is giving you now.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.640]   We all have-- we all take a moment
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:10.800]   and keep our brain on Google.
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.880]   How many times have you talked about that, right?
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:15.840]   So-- or how-- you're talking to someone,
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:17.520]   and you're like, oh, what was the name of that?
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:18.240]   OK.
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:20.760]   That's not where the value is going to come in.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.720]   So that's one.
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:24.200]   So I think risk versus reward.
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:28.040]   I do think the process is interesting,
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:30.440]   because deep neural stimulation is
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:33.120]   becoming such an interesting area in the medical world
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:37.480]   for things like Parkinson's treatment and migraine
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:37.920]   treatment.
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:41.480]   Actually, there's some potential there.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:45.920]   But I really don't want to come from Elon Musk, I guess.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:47.520]   So those are the things that I--
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:49.240]   when I saw this, I was like, this
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:52.320]   could be really compelling, especially as a mechanism
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:56.240]   for delivering real health care into the brain.
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:57.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:01.280]   Well, they're already-- and by the way, quickly,
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:03.800]   it was pointed out that neural link is not doing anything
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.880]   that a number of other research institutions are doing,
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:09.960]   and in many cases, doing better in a more advanced way.
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:12.840]   And that is exactly one of the benefits.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:15.520]   They talk about a tetrapolegic being
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:18.760]   able to type 40 words a minute just by thinking.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.920]   And it's that kind of empowering technology
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:23.600]   that would be amazing.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:28.400]   Not so much me thinking I'm on the beach in Portofino
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.720]   because I have a thing in my head.
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:35.400]   You saw the guy who lost his arm and plugged a--
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:38.080]   I don't know, there was a booger, raspberry pie
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.440]   into the socket and made music.
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:40.800]   Good.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:41.320]   Great.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.440]   That's nice.
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:43.080]   You can do that.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:47.240]   So the BBC asked a number of scientists, the UK's Science
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:49.200]   Media Center.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:52.240]   They put out a press release quoting Professor Andrew Jackson,
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:56.200]   no relation, from-- he's a professor of neural interfaces
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.360]   at Newcastle University.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:00.920]   "I don't think there was anything revolutionary
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:03.000]   in the presentation," he said.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.560]   "But they are working through engineering challenges
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:08.160]   of placing multiple electrodes into the brain.
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:10.960]   In terms of their technology, 1,024 channels
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:13.000]   is not that impressive these days.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.600]   But the electronics to relay them wirelessly
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.400]   is state of the art.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:24.360]   And the robotic implantation is nice."
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.120]   The biggest challenge--
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.560]   See, that's what I said.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.080]   Just like Stacy said.
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:30.440]   I just don't have a British accent or a degree.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:31.400]   It was nice.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:38.320]   This is solid engineering, but mediocre neuroscience,
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.840]   some said.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:44.720]   Elon Musk's-- when asked why isn't this peer reviewed--
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:47.160]   said, well--
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:48.600]   Well, we have--
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:49.440]   That takes time.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:51.840]   In Silicon Valley people, they don't go for that.
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.800]   And we had a control.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:53.920]   I have no, no, no.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:55.640]   His answer was, I have no peer.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:57.000]   I have no peer.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.040]   Who would review it?
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:01.440]   I'm the third richest man on Earth.
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.960]   How the hell did that happen?
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:05.280]   Isn't that amazing, huh?
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.840]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:08.280]   Scott Galloway's laughing.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:12.960]   We're frying.
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:15.000]   A big dog.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.360]   Elon Musk responded with a tweet, of course.
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.080]   It's unfortunately common for many in academia
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.080]   to overweight the value of ideas and underweight bringing
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.200]   them to fruition, good point.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.520]   For example, the idea of going to the moon,
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:34.600]   the idea is trivial, but going to the moon is hard.
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:36.720]   So I don't know.
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:37.320]   He also--
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:38.280]   I'm with them on that.
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:39.680]   I got to give them credit for that,
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:43.040]   because that's a fancy way of saying there's
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:45.360]   a whole lot of talkers and not a lot of doers.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:49.520]   So Elon's doing something.
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:52.640]   Look, I think I do hope I've always
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:55.760]   wanted something like this at some point.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:57.560]   And you're right, Stacey.
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:00.560]   For simply for accessibility, for empowering technology,
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.280]   this would be amazing.
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:08.000]   Imagine Stephen Hawking, instead of having to type into
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.920]   as some sort of interface, being able to communicate--
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:11.640]   Oh, you played the Hawking card.
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.140]   OK.
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:13.140]   All right.
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:15.120]   Right, right.
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.160]   And I think it'd be nice to be able to go to the beach
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.480]   in my head.
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:22.760]   And I do think this will happen eventually.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:25.360]   So these are the first steps.
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:27.620]   We would have mocked a lot of the first steps
[01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:32.400]   in personal computing.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.240]   I have to say, Elon often oversells things.
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.360]   But that's Elon.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:39.640]   I think he's--
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.120]   I don't know.
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.220]   He's a great huckster.
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:47.020]   But he's also done some really good stuff.
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:49.220]   He is the third richest man in the world.
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.860]   How the hell did that happen?
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:53.180]   Stock splits, my friend.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:56.140]   Stock splits.
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:57.620]   It's funny, money.
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:58.100]   It is.
[01:56:58.100 --> 01:56:58.820]   It's just-- yes.
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:56:59.500]   It isn't--
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:00.780]   Paper gains.
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:03.220]   And you know, two Elon's credit, he took all the money
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:05.740]   made in PayPal, which was his initial fortune.
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:06.260]   Yeah.
[01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:07.100]   Sunk it into--
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:12.100]   a risk to a crazy idea to do electric vehicles.
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:14.420]   And he deserves whatever he gets, I think.
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:15.580]   Credit is deserved there.
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:16.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:19.200]   He's worth more than Zuckerberg, which is--
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:20.500]   wow.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.580]   That's big money.
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:25.580]   $111 billion.
[01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:30.580]   But it's still almost just half what Jeff Bezos is worth.
[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:33.460]   Well, Jeff Bezos delivers a lot more than Elon Musk does.
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:34.940]   Yeah.
[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:35.620]   He's the central--
[01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:37.080]   I have a Tesla.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:37.580]   Literally.
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:38.780]   I have a Tesla.
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:40.780]   Yes.
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:42.900]   And you know, yeah, you're right.
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:44.420]   And it is literal.
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:47.180]   If Jeff Bezos does literally deliver--
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:47.520]   All right.
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:48.420]   --actually not.
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:50.620]   Normally, this time of the show, we would do the change log.
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:53.780]   But now we're going to do the moral panic log.
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:54.260]   Because--
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:54.600]   Oh, no.
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.300]   I'm excited about some of the things on the change log.
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:57.140]   Are we still going to do it?
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:58.660]   Yes, of course we are.
[01:57:58.660 --> 01:57:59.160]   OK.
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:00.860]   I was making a bad joke.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:01.860]   Jeff has provided us--
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:02.660]   What?
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:07.060]   --with five fabulous stories on moral panic.
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:09.160]   Just for you, Stacy.
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:10.320]   We'll cover this quickly.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.200]   Oh, I like that.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:12.800]   That's instead of the horns.
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:13.520]   That's what we need.
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:16.320]   We need Jeff's doing his what what do it, Jeff?
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:20.440]   Go what?
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:20.960]   Go what?
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:21.460]   What?
[01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:21.960]   What?
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:22.460]   What?
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:22.960]   What?
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:23.960]   What?
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:23.960]   No.
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:24.960]   I need a more panic.
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:25.960]   What?
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:28.200]   Stacy does-- ooh, ooh, ooh.
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:29.080]   Jeff goes, what?
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:30.080]   What?
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:31.080]   What?
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:32.080]   And it goes--
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:33.080]   Jeff goes like--
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:34.320]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm Ant Pruitt.
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:37.880]   And I'm here to say the time to come to be--
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:39.600]   I go, where's my drink?
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:41.800]   Where's my booze?
[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:42.960]   And I just go--
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.600]   What?
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:46.760]   --government public information advertising
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:50.520]   has been a staple of British life for many years.
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:51.880]   Well, we didn't do the moral panic.
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:53.440]   This is it.
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:57.000]   The moral panic over misinformation.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.040]   Are you just--
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:00.720]   my only supposed to read the headline?
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:01.760]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.160]   I'm happy to have you do as much as you want.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:04.000]   Yes, please go.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.480]   British government has a public awareness campaign
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:07.640]   called Don't Feed the Beast.
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:08.640]   Well, that's not that one's prepped out.
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:09.160]   Yes, right.
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:12.040]   All about online misinformation.
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:12.840]   I think that's good.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.760]   Don't feed the beast.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:16.600]   You don't like that?
[01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:17.520]   This is your brain.
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:18.920]   This is your brain on drugs.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:19.400]   That's not so.
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:20.280]   Just say no.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:22.240]   No, I think it's good.
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:23.800]   Don't feed the beast.
[01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:24.840]   It's a good idea.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:25.520]   I like this.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.200]   Yeah, don't feed the trolls.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:28.320]   Yes, I actually root that.
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:28.840]   Yeah, don't--
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:30.360]   But still, they called it a moral panic.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.680]   I just wanted that on the record.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:32.880]   OK.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:36.000]   Now, here from theconversation.com--
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.640]   Which is an academic site.
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:38.160]   Let's be careful.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:42.560]   --here are faculties, scientific reasoning.
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:45.280]   In our most recent publication in the journal
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:50.000]   Conservation Biology, we examine an error of reasoning
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:50.800]   that props up--
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:52.400]   I think they're Australian.
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:55.320]   --the moral panic of a cat.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.760]   No, they couldn't be Irish.
[01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:57.280]   Stop it!
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.960]   What is the moral panic over cats?
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:05.240]   Well, because everybody was afraid that cats were killing
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:06.200]   all this wildlife.
[02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:07.360]   Oh, they're killing the birds.
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:08.000]   They're killing the birds.
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:08.520]   Yeah.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:09.040]   Right?
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:09.880]   That's the story.
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:12.040]   Everybody believed cats were these horrible beasts.
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:13.200]   Don't let them outside.
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:14.760]   They're ruining the environment.
[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:16.920]   And these scientists say not so much.
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:17.320]   Really?
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:18.920]   There was a moral panic over cats.
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:19.520]   Really?
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.480]   Cats aren't that bad.
[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:21.160]   Wait.
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:22.320]   Is that shaky case against cats?
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:24.200]   How many people--
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:28.240]   Does that mean we don't have to build our caddio?
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:32.000]   We were going to build a caddio, an enclosed patio,
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.320]   so the cats could go outside without getting any birds.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:37.880]   I'm going to need a drink.
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:38.400]   Yes.
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:41.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:43.400]   Wait, I got to read this study.
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:45.720]   It says that cats don't kill birds?
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:46.920]   Oh, no, they kill birds.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:49.960]   But this whole notion that they contribute
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:52.800]   to the conservation of endangered birds by prey.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:56.120]   And so they just say, no.
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:58.760]   There's documented cases of coexistence between cats
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:00:59.920]   and native prey species.
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:01.160]   And everything's OK.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.280]   Just calm down.
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:03.480]   It's all about calming down.
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:05.320]   All right.
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:08.120]   So I could still build the caddio, though.
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:08.720]   Yes, you could.
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:09.320]   I frankly did.
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:11.040]   Well, you don't want the cat to run away.
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:12.880]   So around here, I got foxes.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:14.120]   The fox would kill the cat.
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:15.200]   Right.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:15.960]   So I don't want that to happen.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.560]   We enjoy because we have--
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:18.060]   Wait.
[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:19.240]   Is that documented?
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:21.440]   Or just like myth that--
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.480]   The foxes kill cats?
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:25.920]   Coyotes and foxes will kill your small pets.
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:29.760]   The dingo ate my baby.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:31.200]   What is the Reddit question?
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:36.000]   Who would win in a battle between 1,000--
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.320]   what is it?
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:40.960]   A horse-sized duck or 1,000 duck-sized horses.
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:42.400]   Who would win?
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.120]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:51.200]   Who would win that battle between 1,000 horse-sized horses
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:56.160]   or a single horse-sized duck?
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:56.840]   Is it 100?
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:57.320]   100?
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:58.320]   OK, let's bring in the fair.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:00.200]   Give me anything smaller than me.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.120]   100 duck-sized horses.
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:06.440]   I think 100 ducks could even take on ant.
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.720]   I'll be honest.
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:10.040]   They'll just quiet you down.
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:12.120]   Fight words.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:14.800]   This is another moral panic.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:17.040]   QAnon, Mr. X--
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:18.680]   I think this is true.
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:21.680]   Mr. X, our attention away from the real threats to children.
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:25.320]   QAnon, one of the crazy parts of this
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:28.840]   is that democratic leaders and Bill Gates
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:32.280]   are killing children to take a hormone from their blood that
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:34.240]   will keep them from aging.
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:37.640]   So part of QAnon is that, oh, Democrats
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:40.960]   are predators to children, and they're
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:42.960]   keeping him in the basement of this pizza parlor that
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:44.480]   doesn't have a basement.
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:46.760]   But who cares?
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:49.400]   And a number of people pointed this out.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.360]   QAnon does nothing to protect children.
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:53.520]   They make no effort to protect children.
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:54.680]   That's not the point of QAnon.
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:56.680]   Well, some guy came up to Washington with a gun
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:59.080]   ready to shoot up the pizza parlor, but yes, generally.
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:02.640]   Essentially, it doesn't.
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:06.400]   So I think that that's not moral panic.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:08.000]   Well, it is--
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.840]   Well, the QAnon is moral panic.
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.000]   I see what you're saying.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000]   Absolutely.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.360]   It's because bureaucracy theory have moral panic.
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:16.040]   And it's the stranger danger thing,
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:20.120]   which for years kept kids from playing in the street.
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:20.640]   Because--
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:22.360]   Well, people still have stranger danger of years.
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:23.120]   Yeah.
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:23.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:26.520]   Next moral panic.
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:27.400]   Next moral panic.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:32.720]   Concerns over kids' screen time is a modern moral panic,
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:34.680]   says study.
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.040]   Let them watch.
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:37.760]   Let them watch.
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:41.040]   Did you just do a Google search for news over moral panic?
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:41.400]   I did.
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:45.440]   I started on what I found, what, and I thought, I'm doing this.
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:46.440]   This is--
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.920]   This is what he should have more sleep at night.
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:53.240]   Early childhood longitudinal study, an ongoing research
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:55.920]   project conducted by the US Department of Education,
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.440]   it follows different cohorts of children
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.680]   from kindergarten to fifth grade with teacher assessments
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:01.240]   every year.
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:04.720]   They compared the cohorts, kids starting kindergarten
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.240]   in 1998, which would have been roughly our kids' age, Jeff,
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:11.720]   and another beginning kindergarten in 2010
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:13.880]   to see if there are differences in social skills
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:18.200]   between this pre-internet kindergarten class
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:21.240]   and this right smack dab in the middle of the internet
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:23.240]   kindergarten class.
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:26.560]   The researchers found no difference in social skills
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:29.840]   between the 1998 and 2010 cohorts.
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:31.640]   They both displayed similar development
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:32.920]   from kindergarten to fifth grade.
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:36.760]   The only noticeable difference was a slight decrease
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:39.800]   in social skills for children with very frequent use
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:41.920]   of online gaming and social media.
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:43.320]   But even that was a pretty small--
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.960]   Because they're kids anyway, yeah.
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:47.680]   Maybe that-- yeah, which came first, the chicken and--
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:47.680]   Exactly.
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:48.680]   --screen time.
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:49.680]   Exactly, yeah.
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:51.120]   So--
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:53.640]   So then finally, there is a book, which I just finished,
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:57.400]   was Sex and Social Media by Two Academics, which is very good.
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:59.040]   He's there sex in social media.
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:04.680]   But it talks about the societies that
[02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:07.560]   can form in social media people who
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.720]   have been told that they're deviant
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:13.760]   and then confined their themselves.
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:16.680]   Other deviants online.
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:18.800]   And then there was a moral panic around sexting,
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:19.440]   which they go through.
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:21.840]   They have a whole chapter on how that was a moral panic.
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:23.600]   So it was that a moral panic that really
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.160]   wasn't as problematic as--
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:25.720]   Yes.
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:26.720]   Yes.
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:28.800]   So today, if you're interested in this stuff,
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:31.280]   and interested in how society reacts to technology,
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:32.160]   it's a good book.
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:34.640]   Yeah.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:36.600]   OK, that's our moral panic set.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:37.440]   That's our moral panic.
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:40.560]   We need some music for this.
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:43.680]   And it's going to do a rap, the moral panic rap.
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:50.200]   And now it's time to face these speechless.
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:51.000]   It's laughing.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:51.960]   I'm just going to--
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:52.440]   Yeah.
[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.400]   It's laughing.
[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.520]   I did it for you, Stacey.
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:55.800]   I did it for you.
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:57.360]   Five moral panics.
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:58.520]   Five of them.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:05:59.520]   How?
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:00.520]   I feel the panic.
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:02.880]   I'm going to disagree on some of the sex in social media,
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:03.800]   but that's cool.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:06.160]   We're going to talk-- actually, my pick of the week involves this.
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:07.240]   So it'll be a fun thing.
[02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:08.240]   Wow.
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.240]   This is a sexy show.
[02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:11.760]   Plus, I haven't read the book.
[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:14.040]   This is A and T in the place to be.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:17.880]   Watch your social media, because you don't want to see the P
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:19.280]   or the V on the line.
[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:20.720]   It's with me and that--
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:22.160]   OK, sorry about that.
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:24.680]   Why?
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:26.160]   I'm real.
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:27.160]   Wow.
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:28.520]   I was pretty-- I was pretty impressive.
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.240]   I think for a dork.
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:31.760]   Yeah.
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:33.240]   Stacey said, "Let's go."
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:34.640]   Their hands just go.
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:35.840]   My foot in tautics.
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:36.840]   It's a lot of--
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:39.120]   Guys, that's all I've got to say.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:40.120]   It's only too high.
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:42.080]   Oh, please, give me a chance.
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:46.800]   So, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Google change log.
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.800]   The Google change log.
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:52.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:53.760]   So funny.
[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:57.480]   The Google Doodle is now--
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:58.680]   double drums, man.
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:00.000]   Double drums.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:07.080]   The Google Doodle is now crossing over into the Android Google
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:07.600]   Doodle.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:09.360]   So I don't know if that's in the story or not,
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:10.920]   but I noticed that this Google Doodle--
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:11.720]   It's everywhere.
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:13.080]   --would have went on my Android page.
[02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:15.920]   It was popping up in the search bar
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:17.960]   on the bottom of my screen, which was kind of neat.
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:19.440]   I think that's the new thing.
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:21.080]   I think that's the new thing.
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:22.040]   I don't see that before.
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.520]   And this was to honor Jackie--
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.400]   I don't know if it's Ormez.
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:29.480]   She is a black cartoonist and activist who challenged
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:32.360]   the disparaging portrayals of black characters and media
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:35.720]   in the 1940s.
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:36.960]   I saw it, and I thought, what is this?
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:39.920]   Because you'd click it, and it would go on and on.
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:42.200]   It was a long bar.
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:45.520]   It was a comic strip slideshow crid
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:48.960]   to celebrate Jackie Ormez.
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:52.440]   And it was a really cool Google Doodle.
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:54.600]   So that was yesterday.
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:56.880]   And I think it's gone now, unfortunately.
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:57.560]   That is not--
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:07:59.280]   But there's a Google Doodle site.
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:03.520]   You can go to that has all the Google doodles ever.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:06.080]   Google Maps now shows traffic lights at intersections.
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:06.960]   I don't think that's new.
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:08.720]   I think that started doing that a couple of weeks ago.
[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:09.680]   They were working that out.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:11.840]   But no, it's not.
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:12.600]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:13.680]   I can't go to this site.
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:16.160]   It uses cookies.
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:17.720]   Oh, you know what?
[02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:18.920]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:20.440]   I've been to ours taking it many times.
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:22.960]   I probably clicked this months ago.
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:25.600]   But because I deleted all my cookies,
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:28.280]   now I'm going to see every one of these.
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:30.280]   Oh, you use cookies.
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:33.840]   But it happens if you click do not sell my personal info.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:34.640]   Does it--
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:35.880]   Absolutely nothing.
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:37.120]   Absolutely nothing.
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:38.120]   Absolutely nothing.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:39.240]   Click it and say--
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:40.280]   Nobody wants your phone.
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:40.800]   --you're in California.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:41.840]   Yeah, I'm in California.
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:42.960]   That's why I saw that.
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:45.840]   So now you can see traffic lights, a tiny little traffic.
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:47.080]   Tiny little went teeny.
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:49.040]   When you see there is this little teeny,
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:52.800]   and hardly can see a traffic light at the intersection.
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:54.520]   You know, that's going to be not useful so much
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:57.680]   for human drivers, but for autonomous vehicle
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:58.800]   self-driving vehicles.
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:00.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:04.240]   But if the autonomous vehicles have the sensors,
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:05.920]   they shouldn't be able to see.
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:07.600]   Anyway, well, they have to have sensors
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:10.480]   because it's not sufficient to know there's a light there.
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:13.160]   You know how we were talking about real-time auctions
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:14.320]   behind the scenes?
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:16.880]   Imagine your autonomous car performing the same calculations
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.080]   to find traffic signals, which ones are fast,
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:22.880]   or which ones are red, which ones are green,
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:24.680]   which are anticipated to be that at that time
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:26.040]   to give you the fastest route.
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:27.080]   Right.
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:29.800]   So this is a wider role that we talked about this earlier,
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:33.120]   but it's now maybe coming to the maps near you.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:35.480]   Google Assistant's Daily Snapshot feature
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:39.400]   gets birthday reminders and recipe recommendations.
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:41.080]   So we'll just tell you what's on your calendar.
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:42.680]   We'll also tell you what you want to eat today
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:44.200]   because Google knows best.
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:46.480]   I actually hate birthday reminders because--
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:47.320]   I do too.
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.400]   I despise it.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.280]   When Mark Zuckerberg turns 60,
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:51.920]   he's going to regret all those years
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:52.920]   of making people feel--
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:53.920]   Oh.
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:54.760]   Well, it's also--
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:55.760]   I like birthday reminders.
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:57.160]   Of course, you'd be your young.
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:00.560]   Of course, you're young because I don't ever remember them.
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:03.840]   My problem is I have more than 1,500 people in my address book.
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:05.280]   So I get reminders of people--
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:05.800]   Oh.
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:07.120]   I don't really care about it.
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:08.120]   I don't get that.
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:10.480]   No, I don't put their addresses in though.
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:13.240]   Or I'm sorry, their birthdays in.
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:14.280]   Well, that's the problem.
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:16.960]   Nowadays, you don't have to because these calendars--
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:17.440]   Because it's like--
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:20.280]   They look it up, they go searching for it.
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:22.400]   I never knew these people's birthdays,
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:25.320]   but somehow Google does.
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:26.880]   The ones that I get are--
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:29.400]   I actively put them on the calendar
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:34.120]   however many years ago and told it to remind me each year.
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:36.040]   They're not necessarily contacts either.
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:39.720]   So maybe that's why I see it a little bit more useful.
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:42.040]   I may be-- maybe I'm doing it wrong.
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:43.320]   But I feel like--
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:46.480]   You just put in all your data out there.
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.120]   Today is--
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:48.720]   You enabled surveillance mode.
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.160]   Today is Stephanie Hamburg's birthday.
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.960]   Stephanie Hamburg--
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.560]   Carsten, you might remember her.
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:11:00.000]   She was a floor director at Tech TV 20 years ago.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.440]   Well, happy birthday, Stephanie.
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:06.040]   You know where I got this data?
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:07.520]   Facebook.
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:11.360]   At one point-- because it has her Facebook page on here.
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:12.560]   So at one point, I must--
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:13.920]   I don't even have her phone number.
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:15.880]   It's just her birthday and her Facebook page.
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:16.240]   So--
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:18.120]   Always knew who my real friends were
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:20.560]   with those birthday announcements back when I did have
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:21.960]   a Facebook account.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:25.520]   I had a fake birthday in there for myself.
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:28.160]   And I would randomly get these little notifications
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:32.000]   of happy birthday from someone so back home.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.920]   And I'm like, if you were my friend,
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:37.000]   you'd know this isn't my birthday.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.840]   And Neil Dash's 45th birthday.
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:39.760]   I'll be on Saturday.
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:41.320]   Jeff, we know him.
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:41.960]   45.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:42.320]   Wow.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:43.480]   45.
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:44.000]   Thank you.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.200]   I thought he caught up to me by then.
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.560]   I don't think he's that young.
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:47.760]   I think that's the other thing.
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:50.560]   People lie on Facebook.
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:51.560]   Yeah.
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:53.120]   OK.
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:56.760]   Jason Howells, birthday is coming up September 11th.
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.960]   If this is a mistake, Kevin Marks' birthday
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:01.800]   on Sunday, September 13th.
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:03.760]   So some of these people I care about.
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.800]   Would you like to do anything?
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:07.080]   Oh my gosh, back to the change a lot.
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:08.480]   There's exciting stuff on this one.
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:11.880]   Updated assistant snapshot will now make recommendations.
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:12.960]   That one?
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:13.720]   We should do that one.
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:14.560]   Oh, OK.
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:15.480]   That's still--
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:16.560]   That's what we just did.
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:19.560]   --as unexciting as it was moments ago.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:20.800]   It was not exciting.
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:21.800]   Yeah.
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:23.480]   Was it worth remembering a minute ago?
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:28.160]   Kids Space aims to make Android tablets more kid friendly.
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:29.560]   Has anybody used Android tablets?
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:30.040]   Well, but--
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:31.400]   Android tablets are there.
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:34.160]   I think because of schools and Zoom,
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:37.560]   a lot of inexpensive Android tablets are sold, right?
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:38.760]   Because in fact, you know they--
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:40.400]   You can't get a Chromebook, by the way.
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:41.600]   Yeah, for kids.
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:42.200]   Yeah.
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:44.160]   And you know, maybe an iPad's too expensive,
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:46.600]   but you get a $150 Android tablet.
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:49.040]   It'll do Zoom just fine.
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:49.600]   Sure.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:55.560]   This is going to come out on the Lenovo Tab M10 HD Gen 2
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:58.960]   and more devices in the future.
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:00.200]   You know, there's already-- Amazon already
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:01.240]   does this with its fire.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.400]   In fact, they have a fire tablet that
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:07.000]   is guaranteed if the kid breaks it in the first year,
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:07.960]   they'll replace it.
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:09.520]   It comes in a big rubber--
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:11.680]   hard rubber frame.
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:13.600]   I can't figure out what's exciting and stacy in the rest
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:14.920]   of the change lock.
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:15.400]   So it wasn't--
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:16.920]   You got to let us know with it.
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:17.400]   Ooh, ooh.
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:18.080]   Was it bad?
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:19.440]   I will tell you when you get there.
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:20.440]   Oh, OK.
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:21.440]   Get there, man.
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:24.440]   So you may remember we talked a long time
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:27.880]   about the privacy implications of the Apple Google API
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:29.400]   for COVID tracing.
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:33.400]   As of the latest version of iOS and soon the latest version
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:37.480]   of Android, you won't need an app anymore
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:42.400]   to use the COVID tracing API.
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:46.480]   State health agencies can use the information
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:48.280]   without creating a customized app.
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:52.480]   You'll be able to go in to the app and enable it.
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:54.880]   So up to now, if you went to the app,
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:56.680]   it says you don't have an app--
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:58.000]   if you went to the settings, it would say
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.640]   you don't have an app to do this, so you can't enable it.
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:04.160]   But you will be able to enable notifications
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.160]   for COVID exposure.
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.480]   Partly because--
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:09.280]   Has it ever made any sense that every city
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:10.200]   was going to have their own app?
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:10.920]   Yeah, nobody's doing.
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:12.480]   A re-health department was going to have their own app
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:13.400]   and read those sense.
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:13.920]   Yeah.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:15.560]   Yeah, it was every state.
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:18.040]   Six states have actually built one so far.
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:20.440]   I think 25 were trying to make it happen.
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:21.600]   So it does make sense.
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:23.640]   But the downside is you trade off data.
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:26.880]   So this is a very realistic version
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:30.200]   of your ease of use versus privacy, convenience
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:31.080]   versus security.
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:33.880]   So the Washington Post writing about this
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:39.480]   had 35 of their staffers download the Virginia COVID-wise
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:41.760]   app, which launched last month.
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:45.760]   In a week of using it, zero receives an exposure to--
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:47.000]   There's nobody knows about it.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.240]   Yeah, nobody has the app.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:49.200]   Yeah, so--
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:50.960]   It was a--
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:54.720]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's the problem.
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:55.600]   Nobody's using it.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:57.680]   Nobody wants to use it.
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:58.400]   Anyway, this could be--
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:00.120]   Well, let's encourage people to use it.
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:01.000]   Yeah, I'm going to--
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.440]   Yeah, I'll turn it on.
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:03.680]   I'll turn it on.
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:05.520]   You know, I don't know what you're going to do with it.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:09.760]   If you're notified, you then quarantine for two weeks.
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:10.120]   Right?
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:11.240]   What do you do?
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:13.440]   Would you suggest I do that?
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:17.720]   I think when you find the health department follows up
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:19.840]   with you and tells you what to do.
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:22.440]   Yeah, quarantine.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:25.440]   Well, maybe or maybe they give you a test.
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:26.560]   Or they should test you.
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:28.080]   I don't know.
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:28.720]   Do we have tests?
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:30.000]   That's a good question.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:30.920]   Do you test--
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:32.800]   Whoa.
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:34.800]   Depends on where you are.
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:37.320]   If you're at the White House, you can get tested.
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:39.960]   If you're a football college football player, you can get--
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:42.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:46.040]   OK, this is coming up on the story.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:47.960]   Oh, we're getting there.
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:48.720]   We're getting there.
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:49.440]   Oh, I know why.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:51.800]   She loves undersea cables.
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:52.560]   Oh, that's right.
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:53.960]   Oh, there's an undersea cable?
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.040]   Oh, there is an undersea cable.
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:57.040]   That's not it.
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:57.840]   Next story.
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:00.520]   Google and Facebook, we're going to have their undersea cable
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:01.680]   terminate in Hong Kong.
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:05.520]   But now, there's this whole thing about China.
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:10.560]   So now they're going to have it terminate, I think, in Malaysia.
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:12.000]   Taiwan, Taiwan.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:12.500]   Taiwan.
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:15.080]   Which is off China, which is probably
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:17.600]   part of why Trump is making this happen.
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:21.840]   This is the Pacific light cable network.
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.520]   This sounds like a '70s band, yellow.
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:28.320]   That's a good name for a '70s band.
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:30.640]   Yeah, that's nice.
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:31.240]   That's nice.
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.080]   OK, this is the story I'm excited about.
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:37.720]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, starting in Austin, Texas--
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:38.280]   Let's hear it.
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:38.800]   --stasis.
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:39.300]   --stasis.
[02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:41.200]   Former home.
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:45.800]   You can now pay for parking directly from Google Maps.
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:47.640]   That's awesome.
[02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:48.920]   It is.
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:52.240]   I mean, let me just say that parking--
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:54.240]   every time I'm parking someplace--
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:56.440]   like Seattle has two or three different places--
[02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:57.040]   So annoying, you know.
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:58.160]   --the apps that do parties.
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:00.200]   So you're like, I've got to download an app that's--
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:01.200]   You're standing here.
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.840]   --of my standing here.
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:03.840]   Yep.
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:04.840]   That's annoying.
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:04.840]   --in it.
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:06.320]   --at least it says, what's going on?
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.520]   Why are you standing there?
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:10.360]   I'm downloading the app so I could pay for parking.
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:11.800]   But you've been standing there for 10 minutes.
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:12.200]   Well, I know.
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:13.800]   It's still coming in.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:14.920]   And then you have like--
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:16.560]   They've got a credit card number in it.
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:17.080]   --of parking apps.
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:17.600]   That's so annoying.
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:19.120]   Yes.
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:20.760]   It's not safe.
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:23.280]   That's what drives me absolutely buggy about this.
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:27.040]   I am standing in a parking lot focused on my phone--
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:27.400]   Right.
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:28.800]   --with my wallet out.
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:29.800]   Right.
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.360]   It is so dangerous.
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:33.600]   Didn't think about it like that.
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:34.280]   Wow.
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:37.320]   That's because you're a man, probably.
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:41.240]   But I train myself never to be focused on anything
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:43.080]   in a parking lot other than--
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:45.640]   I don't think Ant would ever get mugged.
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:48.920]   I don't care if he's waving $100 bills in the air.
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:51.000]   I don't think--
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.160]   I think fate.
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:53.520]   Don't worry guys, I can't--
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:54.960]   --like to try people like me.
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:55.960]   Yes, but I'm really--
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:56.640]   --a sizable red word.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:01.920]   See, I'm never having been a fit or in any way strong person.
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:03.000]   I didn't know this.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.720]   So if you walk around looking big and strong,
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:09.720]   people like Popeye, they go, OK.
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:10.720]   Come on, let me--
[02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:14.480]   There's always a jackass that thinks he's the bigger, better
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:16.960]   man, if you will.
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:18.360]   You see it a lot with--
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:19.720]   It just takes pity on me.
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:21.240]   It's like-- it's like-- It's like-- it's like--
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:22.200]   Oh, it's like-- they just--
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:25.440]   Don't be-- just a sack of salt water.
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:26.600]   Say, give me your mind.
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:29.600]   I'm not supposed to fear for me quite a bit whenever I
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:31.360]   would travel, because she makes sense.
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:31.860]   Yeah.
[02:18:31.860 --> 02:18:32.680]   Oh, people were.
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:35.200]   She's like, when you're out in the streets or whatever,
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:38.560]   just try to be careful, because people would just--
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:41.200]   They just want to get froggy and want to try and see
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:41.880]   how tough they are.
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:43.240]   They take you on, yes.
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:45.800]   So you should do like I do, and wear a shapeless mumu.
[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:52.960]   People just think you're fat.
[02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:54.400]   They will know.
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:57.000]   So this is cool, but it is limited.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.960]   I guess passport the company that says
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:03.560]   parking in Austin, that's who they've partnered with.
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:05.440]   iOS or Android.
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:09.520]   Or you can go to pay.google.com/parking on the mobile web.
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:12.480]   It will remember your car information.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:13.440]   It will remember--
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:15.440]   Also remember where you parked your car, which is nice.
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:15.940]   Nice.
[02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:16.440]   Payment information.
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:17.360]   That's awesome.
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:18.360]   Yeah.
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:18.720]   And--
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:21.360]   And I'm betting, here's the cool stuff, right?
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:22.080]   Imagine this.
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:25.280]   Take it fast forward like three years?
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:26.120]   Two years?
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:28.960]   Google now knows that I am parked in a spot, right?
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:32.480]   So when I leave or by time runs out,
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:34.120]   I can send notifications, and it can
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:36.840]   assume that spot is empty, which it can help update
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:40.280]   its own parking data.
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:42.360]   So that's that data that could eventually become--
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:43.640]   Oh, would that be cool?
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:46.120]   And I still didn't really care about us.
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:48.160]   It would say Stacy paid for two hours,
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:50.960]   but she only used an hour and 15, and all you need is 10 minutes,
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:51.460]   Jeff.
[02:19:51.460 --> 02:19:53.720]   Free spot.
[02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:55.080]   I mean, I guess it could, because it
[02:19:55.080 --> 02:19:56.880]   knows the location of my--
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:57.880]   it drives off.
[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:58.760]   But that--
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:01.040]   maybe if I have to click on it and be like--
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:01.560]   That'd be sick.
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:02.240]   I really cared about us.
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:05.880]   It'd be like, you were only here for an hour of your two.
[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:06.760]   You want your money back?
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:10.080]   Or just would you like to donate to the next person?
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:11.120]   That'd be cool.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:12.800]   So here's what it looks like.
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:13.680]   It's in Google Pay.
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:16.040]   Pay for Street Parking with Google Pay.
[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:17.560]   Start a new session.
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:19.440]   It'll ask you for the zone number.
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:21.640]   Now, you got to have a zone number.
[02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:24.000]   I'll say 1, 2, 3.
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.320]   And apparently, I'm going to be almost about to spend $10
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:26.920]   parking.
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:27.920]   This parking zone does--
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:28.720]   In Austin.
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:30.560]   It exists.
[02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:33.720]   Yeah, it was probably some larger number.
[02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:36.120]   Yeah, no, it doesn't like it.
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:38.600]   I wish it did.
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:38.920]   Wait, wait.
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:39.920]   I got his own map coming up.
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:42.920]   I got his own map.
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:47.200]   Street Parking, Austin government.
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:50.960]   I can tell you where to go.
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:52.520]   Meanwhile, back in the middle of the world--
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:54.000]   And you know it every week, Stacey.
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.480]   Lenovo has unveiled a Google Assistant powered smart clock.
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:00.400]   Lenovo did those smart screens.
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:01.040]   This is nice.
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:04.400]   It's got that Google fabric.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:05.840]   It's just a clock.
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:06.360]   Well--
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:07.320]   No, it's not.
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:09.000]   It's a smart clock.
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.600]   It's a smart speaker.
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:10.600]   Yeah.
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:11.520]   And a clock.
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:13.000]   Yeah.
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:13.520]   It does--
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:17.800]   Oh, and instead of an LCD, it's using LEDs, so it's cheaper.
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:19.760]   But-- and here's what we talked about on my show,
[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:22.000]   because these clocks are very important to me.
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.880]   I have a Sony Dream Machine from like--
[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:25.000]   Oh, my God.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:25.500]   Wow.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:26.000]   You had--
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:26.760]   When I was in high school?
[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:27.760]   That was the square one.
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:29.320]   It's like a cube, right?
[02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:30.600]   No, it's actually-- mine's old.
[02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:31.520]   It's rectangular.
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:32.000]   Like that?
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:32.960]   It's rectangular?
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:33.960]   Oh.
[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:37.320]   What if-- a rectangular?
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:40.560]   So-- but I was--
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:42.520]   I'm frustrated because I don't know how low you
[02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:43.720]   condemn the LEDs.
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:46.600]   And I would love for them to have used red LEDs,
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:48.160]   because that's softer at night.
[02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:48.960]   Wouldn't keep you up.
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:50.640]   Totally couldn't.
[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:51.160]   So--
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:51.920]   Come on, Lenovo.
[02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:54.080]   This is an update to their previous smart clock.
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:55.720]   This is called the smart clock essential.
[02:21:55.720 --> 02:21:56.680]   It's less.
[02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:59.800]   It's about 30 bucks less, which is nice.
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:04.240]   It will hit the shelves sometime this month.
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:06.760]   And it doesn't-- yeah, see, I have the--
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:10.360]   I kind of like the Nest Hub Mini, which
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:12.320]   doesn't have a camera, so it's appropriate for the bedroom,
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:14.960]   because it has a picture screen.
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:17.840]   But it also will show me the time, if I want just time.
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:19.080]   And I can talk to it.
[02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:22.400]   The best thing about the Google alarms is you can yell stop.
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:23.560]   And it'll stop.
[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:24.600]   You don't have to wait.
[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:26.200]   You don't have to say, hey, anybody or anything.
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:27.840]   Just stop.
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:29.840]   It's very satisfying.
[02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:30.600]   It is nice.
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:31.360]   I do that all the time.
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:32.320]   Yeah.
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:34.600]   Timers work that way, too.
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:41.000]   Finally, Google is adding local news to your assistance
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.840]   audio.
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:46.480]   So see, I'm getting that cookie in the house, but everywhere.
[02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:53.840]   So last fall, they launched their smart audio news playlist.
[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:58.040]   But now your news update is coming to Google Podcasts.
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:00.480]   So if you're a podcast listener, you
[02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:03.280]   can open the Podcast app, navigate to the Explore tab,
[02:23:03.280 --> 02:23:05.880]   and subscribe to your news update.
[02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:07.840]   You'll get a mix of short news stories
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:10.320]   chosen in the moment based on your interest.
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:13.200]   I guess it's kind of like Google News, but just for audio.
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:15.400]   And it knows your location as well.
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:20.120]   So you will hear about--
[02:23:20.120 --> 02:23:21.640]   so for instance, they give an example.
[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:24.560]   If you're a music fan living in Los Angeles,
[02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:28.200]   you might hear a local story about the governor's latest
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:33.320]   announcement, then a review of the latest Carrie Petty.
[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:36.040]   Katy Perry album.
[02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:38.960]   I do want to know what Carrie Petty's up to these days,
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:42.560]   followed by a deep dive of the upcoming election.
[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:47.040]   So this is Google trying to understand audio news,
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:49.960]   like it understands text news, and giving you something
[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:50.640]   you want to hear.
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:51.360]   I'm going to turn that on.
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:53.160]   I think that sounds like a good feature.
[02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:57.080]   That's available in the Google Podcasts app.
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:59.080]   And I presume if you've got that turned on,
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:01.920]   you could also do it on your Google Assistant.
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:03.600]   If you said, what is it?
[02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:07.800]   Hey, Google, play local news, or hey, Google,
[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:10.800]   play news about Petaluma.
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:13.240]   Unfortunately, they're still doing some of that text-to-speech
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:14.520]   stuff, which I really don't like.
[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:17.040]   It's too robotic.
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:18.360]   Really got better.
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:21.960]   And that is the Google change law.
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:25.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:28.520]   La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:31.040]   I got one story before we move on.
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:33.080]   I really want to do.
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:36.240]   Because I just want to play this audio.
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:41.720]   So apparently-- let me find the audio.
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:47.320]   This happened the other day at LAX, pilot flying--
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:48.760]   Let me jump ahead.
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:52.800]   This is a report from a local--
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:55.120]   An American Airlines pilot reports, quote,
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:57.200]   "A guy in a jetpack.
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:00.840]   A second pilot believed to be a Sky West flight confirms.
[02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:03.240]   A third pilot was on the lookout."
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:06.040]   We just saw the guys have to fire, so--
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:08.840]   JetBlue 23, Ease Cotton.
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:11.640]   Pertman and Jetpack reported 300-yard,
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:14.680]   South of the LA final at about 3,000 feet and mile high.
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:19.640]   A guy flying roughly the speed of a jet airplane
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:21.720]   at 3,000 feet.
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:22.720]   Here's the--
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:24.800]   We just passed a guy in a jetpack.
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:27.120]   American 1997 OK.
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:28.080]   Thank you, are they up here?
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:29.520]   Left side or right side?
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:33.520]   Off to left side, maybe 300 yards or so.
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:35.320]   All power out suits.
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:37.280]   OK, how many 99.7--
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:39.080]   A guy in a jetpack.
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:40.280]   It's Elon Musk.
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:41.280]   Of course it's Elon Musk.
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:44.800]   LAX!
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:47.400]   Of course, this is from Fox 11 in LA,
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:52.600]   and a number of experts came on saying how dangerous that is,
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:54.440]   not only for the guy who could be sucked right
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:56.400]   into the engines, but for the passengers
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:58.120]   and the airplane itself.
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:00.240]   Well, plus at that, he's got to be kept--
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:02.440]   We're an oxygen at 3,000 feet, don't you?
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:03.640]   No, no, no.
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:04.160]   No?
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:04.840]   3,000 feet?
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:05.360]   OK.
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:06.200]   Oh, haven't you ever--
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:08.960]   Have you never climbed a mountain?
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:11.360]   Have you never walked a hill?
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:12.560]   No.
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:15.200]   I can tell you that I did a hike this last weekend that
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:16.040]   had a 3,000 feet.
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:18.600]   Actually, it was 3,900 elevation gains.
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:19.120]   Oh, OK.
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:20.680]   Have you never been the lake tower?
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:22.680]   It's at 5,000 feet.
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:24.200]   I was out of breath, though.
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:24.600]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:27.360]   It's a little harder to breathe.
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:28.080]   Yeah.
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:30.200]   So at least two pilots saw it.
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:35.720]   Can I just take a moment and say that everybody
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:37.440]   handled that with such a plow?
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:38.800]   Don't you love these guys?
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:40.160]   You're so jetpack.
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:41.520]   OK.
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:43.080]   I love ATC.
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:44.920]   I'm sorry to that.
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:47.080]   Is that on the right side or the left side?
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:48.640]   I'm just like--
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:49.640]   I love ATC.
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:50.960]   Did you hear what I did?
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:53.760]   Is it a jetpack?
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:56.880]   This is the funniest thing.
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:58.760]   I got to play it one more time.
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:02.640]   This is-- here we go.
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:05.640]   Let me just scroll back a little bit.
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:06.160]   Again.
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:07.520]   Oh, we're American 1997.
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:09.640]   We just passed the guy in a jetpack.
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:12.000]   American 1997 OK.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:12.520]   Thank you.
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:14.360]   Were they up to your left side or right side?
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:18.360]   Off to West Side at maybe 300 yards or so.
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:20.200]   How are our altitude?
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:20.640]   OK.
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:22.560]   How about your 1997?
[02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:24.520]   So just to-- I guess you don't show up
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:27.440]   on the radar if you're in a jetpack.
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:28.120]   Clearly.
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:29.840]   Unless he had his cell phone with him.
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:35.560]   All the passengers are going to show up
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:37.160]   on his COVID tracking app.
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:39.080]   That's right.
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.800]   Good point.
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:45.120]   Now, 300 feet is the Bluetooth limit.
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:47.600]   Sorry, Dad.
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:48.800]   All right.
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:51.480]   Now, this is where we're going to insert an ad
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:53.920]   unless there is no ad or you're watching a video or the live
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:54.120]   story.
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:55.400]   That was a really smooth--
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:57.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:27:59.160]   Insert, there we go.
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:00.960]   I think that was lovely.
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:02.080]   You could just be like--
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:04.800]   And now is the time when we may or may not
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:06.360]   insert an ad.
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:07.400]   I can just do that, right?
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:08.720]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:10.960]   Yeah, I can.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:16.800]   And now, a word from an advertiser--
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:18.160]   That I had nothing to do with.
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:20.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:22.520]   At this time, we would like to play you
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:25.440]   this important message or not.
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:26.440]   Unless.
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:27.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:29.160]   Or not.
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:30.480]   It's like that's going to not go down well
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:32.200]   if it's a gambling site.
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:34.080]   And we're back.
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:34.920]   That was easy.
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:37.360]   That was painless.
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:41.440]   Let us start with Stacy's thing of the week.
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:42.960]   So y'all are going to get mad at me,
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:45.320]   but I did actually just order a whole bunch of things.
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:48.640]   So I've got things for y'all coming.
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:50.920]   And I will make a note of this one thing.
[02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:55.360]   It's not out yet, but Lifex just announced Lifex Clean,
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:29:00.840]   which is a light bulb with HEV lighting that
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:05.800]   says it will clean your counters.
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:06.320]   What?
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:08.600]   Things that the light hits, everything, the light touches.
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:10.880]   But they won't hurt you.
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:11.360]   Right.
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:13.400]   It is capable of-- it's safer people,
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:17.960]   but capable of killing germs, such as E. coli and strap
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:18.600]   the cholesterol.
[02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:20.760]   Do I insert it in my body?
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:21.520]   Oh, you should.
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:23.520]   Do not insert it in your body.
[02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:25.600]   But you could open your mouth really wide when it--
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:28.360]   and it only does this when it turns on for a certain amount
[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:32.240]   of time, and then it puts a white light.
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:34.760]   So this might be something you put in your bathroom
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.720]   to kill your fecal plume off your toothbrush.
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:37.640]   Oh, you know what about the--
[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:38.640]   Yes.
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:41.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:44.680]   Or you could stick it on your kitchen counters.
[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:47.200]   It doesn't say that it kills Listeria or Salmonella,
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:48.680]   but you know, there's--
[02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:48.960]   It's not--
[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:50.200]   E. coli is still bad.
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:53.440]   Not yet on the Lifex website, but--
[02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:54.920]   It's going to cost $70.
[02:29:54.920 --> 02:29:55.120]   Yikes.
[02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:56.760]   I think just announced it today.
[02:29:56.760 --> 02:29:59.720]   Are these-- I mean, these are fairly expensive LED bulbs.
[02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:02.000]   Are they good?
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:03.720]   The Lifex bulbs are actually really good.
[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:07.160]   They used to be before Philips Hue upped its game.
[02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:10.880]   They used to be brighter and better colors.
[02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:12.000]   The reason they're more expensive
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:13.400]   is because you don't need a hub.
[02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:14.000]   They're Wi-Fi.
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:14.880]   Oh, I like that.
[02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:15.280]   That's right.
[02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:17.280]   They've built in Wi-Fi, yeah.
[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:22.040]   They're also-- what is it?
[02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:23.560]   No hub.
[02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:24.520]   I like the colors.
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:26.280]   They actually do a really nice turquoise,
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:27.400]   which is a tough color to do.
[02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:30.200]   And they're a little bit brighter than Philips Hue.
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:31.040]   But they are expensive.
[02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:34.600]   They're like 50 bucks a ball.
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:37.640]   And a lot of them are sold out, which is a little--
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:37.920]   Yes.
[02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:39.920]   And this doesn't go on sale until October.
[02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:40.960]   I'm just going to tell you that.
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:42.560]   So you would get this--
[02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:44.120]   if you didn't want to kill your fecal plume,
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:48.080]   you might also get this for the kitchen.
[02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:48.560]   Sure.
[02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:51.400]   I'm probably not going to get this, probably honest.
[02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:52.400]   Yeah.
[02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:54.840]   But if I were going to get it, it
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:59.080]   would go smack into the bathroom, right underneath.
[02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:01.360]   No, actually, that makes a lot of sense.
[02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:03.480]   If it works.
[02:31:03.480 --> 02:31:04.440]   I mean, I feel like--
[02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:06.160]   There is a lot of research on these lights.
[02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:08.720]   And-- We know UVC will kill bacteria,
[02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:09.920]   but it's also harmful to humans.
[02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:11.360]   So--
[02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:11.760]   Yeah.
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:14.400]   I think the question is, how long does it
[02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:14.920]   need to be on?
[02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:16.440]   How close does it need to be?
[02:31:16.440 --> 02:31:20.040]   What percentage of the germs?
[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:21.280]   And those are a lot of variables.
[02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:23.080]   And how well does that work in the real world?
[02:31:23.080 --> 02:31:26.680]   Even the wipey wipes, if you look at them closely,
[02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:29.640]   you need to have them for a certain number of minutes
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:30.760]   to be on the counter.
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:32.960]   You have to let it be wet for half a minute or a minute.
[02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:34.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:37.720]   So, by the way, you cannot get wipes to save your soul.
[02:31:37.720 --> 02:31:39.960]   You just can't.
[02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:40.360]   I'm here.
[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:45.520]   I'm waiting for six months to get hand sanitizer.
[02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:47.240]   This is the one I use, which is--
[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:48.760]   it smells like coconut and lemon.
[02:31:48.760 --> 02:31:49.520]   It's really good.
[02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:52.360]   It's for everyone, for everybody.
[02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:53.880]   And they've been out of stock for six months,
[02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:55.880]   and I just got a six of them.
[02:31:55.880 --> 02:31:56.880]   I couldn't believe it.
[02:31:56.880 --> 02:31:56.880]   Wow.
[02:31:56.880 --> 02:32:00.600]   So I'm willing to sell these for a mere $100 each.
[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:04.880]   Hand sanitizers coming back in, but wipes, bleach, alcohol.
[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:06.680]   Can't buy alcohol anywhere.
[02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:07.320]   Yeah.
[02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:08.160]   Wow.
[02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:09.760]   I have alcohol right here.
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:11.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:13.240]   You did get a drink.
[02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:15.000]   In real gin and tonic, what kind of gin
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.080]   are you drinking today?
[02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:18.960]   Someone get that gift.
[02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:23.800]   I think it's a local gin or a Portland gin.
[02:32:23.800 --> 02:32:27.640]   I know that you're a great gin-afile, if that's a word.
[02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:28.840]   I do love a good gin.
[02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:29.360]   I'll also--
[02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:31.360]   I knew the moral panics would lead her to drink.
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:32.000]   I knew it.
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:32.640]   I knew it.
[02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:34.320]   Yeah, it worked.
[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:37.480]   OK, but my other thing that I'm really--
[02:32:37.480 --> 02:32:39.480]   I gave you a thing because I feel bad about--
[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:41.160]   I keep not recommending you things.
[02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:43.520]   But this is really important, and I'm reading it,
[02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:46.920]   and I will really encourage everyone, especially who
[02:32:46.920 --> 02:32:51.240]   has sons to read it, because I think it's really important.
[02:32:51.240 --> 02:32:53.440]   There is a book called "Boys and Sex."
[02:32:53.440 --> 02:32:56.480]   It's by Peggy Oranstein, who did the book "Girls and Sex."
[02:32:56.480 --> 02:32:58.040]   And this was a couple years ago.
[02:32:58.040 --> 02:32:59.680]   Yeah, I think I recommended it here.
[02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:06.520]   But it talked about how our kids are--
[02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:10.240]   the messages they get and how it really hurts them
[02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:10.760]   in a lot of ways.
[02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:12.920]   And her first book was all about how it hurts girls,
[02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:13.760]   and she was done.
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:15.160]   She's always done girls.
[02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:17.400]   But after that, she realized that it's
[02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:21.280]   impossible to talk about coercion and the pressures
[02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:24.680]   that girls face without also saying--
[02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:28.360]   without also recognizing that boys play a huge part in this.
[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:30.600]   So she went and talked to, I think,
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:34.160]   over 200 boys in college and high school
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:37.120]   to get their opinions and thoughts about--
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:38.640]   it's their sexual history.
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:40.760]   It's what they've learned from people.
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:42.960]   And she backs a saw up with both her research
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:47.640]   and then actual research from social scientists
[02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:49.880]   and that sort of thing.
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:51.760]   In the book, breaks my heart.
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:54.600]   Because-- and I know this.
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:55.440]   I have nephews.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:56.600]   I don't have sons.
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:58.680]   I do have a daughter.
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:01.600]   They're not getting-- no one's talking to them at all
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:03.280]   about sex and feelings.
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:06.400]   And they have no expectations around their emotions.
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:12.680]   And it really-- yes, it can make them behave like entitled jerks.
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:16.800]   But it also-- it's like they don't have any other options.
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:18.040]   And it really drives that home.
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:19.800]   And it offers some really concrete things.
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:24.360]   And I think-- I really think if you have kids,
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:25.160]   you should read this.
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:27.200]   And if you have sons, you should read it.
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:28.960]   So you can actually talk to them.
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:33.280]   Because if you don't talk to them about these issues,
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:36.640]   you're setting them up to be basically incomplete humans
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:41.840]   in the sense that they don't know how to engage with people
[02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:45.960]   in an intimate manner, both sexually and emotionally.
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:48.840]   This is something parents are really struggling with right now,
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:49.760]   I think.
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:50.260]   Yes.
[02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:52.640]   And it's a very-- it's a challenge.
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:54.880]   Because these kids are growing up in a world
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:58.080]   with a lot more information and a lot more exposure to sex
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:34:59.720]   than we ever had.
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:02.360]   And it's hard to know how it's affecting them.
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:04.880]   And it's hard to know how to talk to them about it.
[02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:06.080]   Girls are speaking up.
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:07.280]   Thank God.
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:10.480]   And how many-- some of these boys have
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:14.000]   had their own me-to moments where they realized.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.920]   But at the time, they didn't realize they were being--
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:18.960]   they didn't realize they were literally destroying
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:20.640]   some young woman's life.
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:21.140]   Right.
[02:35:21.140 --> 02:35:22.880]   And they didn't do it out of malice.
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:23.560]   No.
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:24.320]   Yes.
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:25.240]   And that hurts me.
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:27.120]   Just imagine.
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:28.960]   Imagine these kids when 10 years later,
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:32.480]   they come to realize that that time, they might have really
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:33.160]   destroyed some.
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:36.280]   I mean, most people don't want to be that person.
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:41.720]   So anyway, I'm clearly speaking to you from the heart.
[02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:43.400]   But y'all should read this.
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:43.800]   It's good.
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:46.280]   I'm ordering it right now because we have a seven-year-old
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:46.560]   at home.
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:48.400]   And I think it's important.
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:51.000]   And it's challenging.
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.200]   Did you put recommendation?
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:53.680]   Yeah, good recommendation.
[02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:55.880]   I don't think we've actually said the name.
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:01.120]   It's boys and sex, young men on hookups, love, porn, consent,
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:03.800]   and navigating the new masculinity.
[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:06.080]   And it's by Peggy Orrinstein.
[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:07.440]   And if you don't think you need to read it,
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:09.400]   you should read her first one on girls and sex,
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:10.760]   because then you will be like, oh crap,
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:12.160]   now I've got to read about boys and sex,
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:15.440]   because that's like the why you should care,
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:17.640]   even if you didn't care before.
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:18.440]   But you should care.
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:19.360]   It's your kid.
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:20.440]   It's damaging the women.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:21.560]   And yeah.
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:24.720]   And I think that's very sensitive of you
[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:28.280]   to know that it's not the boys being malicious necessarily.
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:30.080]   I mean, it could be in some cases.
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:31.600]   Sometimes it's just ignorance.
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:34.400]   And especially if they've seen a lot of porn
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:36.840]   or they've kind of been influenced by the sexualization
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:40.120]   and modern media, and they just don't know.
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:42.440]   They just don't know any better.
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:44.000]   That's good.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:45.040]   Help your parents.
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:47.840]   Thank you for that recommendation.
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:51.640]   And actually, you know, I'm going to save you for the end,
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:54.840]   because what you have is so important
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:57.360]   that I want to give you a little more time.
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:00.280]   How about you, Jeff, your number of the week?
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:02.720]   It should be 11, because I've now been on Zoom
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:04.480]   for 11 hours.
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:05.360]   This poor guy.
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:06.760]   Oh, my God.
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:07.680]   Oh, 11.
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:10.280]   And I could send you a gen in, Tonic.
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:11.400]   Oh, you need it.
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:12.440]   Oh, I need it.
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:13.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:14.800]   Let's see here.
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:17.480]   I'll do this one.
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:18.520]   OK.
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:22.960]   The price of a gig in data worldwide, an interactive map.
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:30.400]   So if you look at it, here, I'm pulling it up right now.
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:31.720]   I'm going to get it here, too.
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:32.680]   Yeah.
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:37.080]   So a gig in India--
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:38.080]   is it India?
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:40.080]   Oh, sorry.
[02:37:40.080 --> 02:37:41.080]   No, I can't do it.
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:42.960]   See, I have 11 hours of screw this up.
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:43.480]   All right.
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:44.000]   Awesome.
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.640]   A gig in Greenland--
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:47.160]   There you go.
[02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:52.360]   The average price is $9.56, the least expensive $5,
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:56.120]   the most expensive $36.22.
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:58.360]   How about-- let's try Japan.
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:37:59.440]   Well, go to India.
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:01.120]   It's rank number one.
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:04.120]   It has an average price of $0.09.
[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:04.720]   Oh, it's funny.
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:05.040]   OK.
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:07.960]   So even though it's not colored, there is information there.
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:09.000]   That's the least expensive.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:09.760]   I see.
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:13.320]   So the darker the color, the more expensive it is.
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:14.080]   So India--
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:17.000]   So the average price of the US is $8.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.760]   The US $8.
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:20.240]   Japan--
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:21.880]   Keepers in the US is $2.28.
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:24.680]   Keepers in India is $0.2.
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:26.760]   See, and I've always thought, for instance, Sweden
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:29.400]   had the best prices.
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:31.800]   And it's $2.
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:33.160]   Finland is $2.
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:36.080]   Norway is $5.
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:39.600]   Great Britain, $1.39.
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:40.920]   This is very interesting.
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:42.360]   What an interesting map.
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:44.000]   So they've actually gone out.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.880]   And now are they all cellular carriers?
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:48.480]   Or is it--
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:48.960]   A mobile data.
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:48.960]   OK.
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:50.200]   So this is mobile data.
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:50.800]   That's important.
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:51.400]   It's mobile data.
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:55.360]   I think mobile data is more expensive than landline.
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:58.000]   Canada is more expensive than the US.
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.800]   That's because Canada is not a competitive market at all.
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:02.440]   At all, right.
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:04.960]   Average price of Canada is $12.55.
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:06.800]   Australia, wow.
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:11.040]   Also, I would say not a competitive market, but $0.68.
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:13.920]   Russia $0.52.
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:15.640]   Wow, interesting.
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:19.600]   Yes, this tells you more about the state of the mobile economy.
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:22.440]   Brazil is $1.
[02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:25.400]   But Peru is $2.
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:27.120]   Interesting.
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:28.160]   Yeah, so that was fun.
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:29.000]   Yeah.
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:34.520]   Mexico $4.77 compared to $8 the average price in the US.
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:37.880]   Of a gigabyte of data.
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:40.000]   Actually, $8 seems low.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.560]   I don't know anywhere you can get a gigabyte of mobile data
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:43.560]   for less than 10.
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:46.440]   Right.
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:48.400]   Most expensive in the US is $6.
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:52.000]   Oh, well, so the challenge in calculating these,
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.400]   our data plans are really spectacular
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:57.640]   at being incredibly complicated in ourselves.
[02:39:57.640 --> 02:39:59.400]   So, yeah.
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:00.160]   True, yeah.
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:03.680]   But like Google Fi, it's $10 a gigabyte, right?
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:05.000]   Think it is.
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.600]   But you get a certain amount before you go over it.
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:08.080]   No.
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:08.520]   You don't?
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:09.840]   No.
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:10.840]   Here.
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:11.840]   Here.
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:12.840]   Here.
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:14.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:17.760]   But our sponsor Mint Mobile--
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:18.240]   Mobile.
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:21.040]   I get 12 gigabytes a month for $25,
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:23.280]   so it's just about $2 a gigabyte.
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:29.400]   So, honestly, there is a broad range.
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:30.920]   Oh, is Google--
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:32.200]   yeah, it's $10 a gigabyte.
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:33.560]   It is.
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:34.400]   Huh.
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:36.040]   Yeah.
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:37.160]   Good numbers, Jeff.
[02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:40.040]   You gave us a lot of numbers.
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:41.800]   Well, the other one that's worth mentioning,
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:43.960]   even though I'm 11 hours into this,
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:46.640]   is that more than 2/3 of executives
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:49.280]   plan to downsize their office space.
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:49.640]   Yeah.
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:50.880]   So don't buy any reets.
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:51.880]   No.
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:53.240]   No, I agree.
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:55.440]   And that we work stock, you thought
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:57.920]   you were going to really cash in on.
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:40:58.400]   Yeah.
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:01.720]   You should have traded it in for Wayfair.
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:04.600]   And you have the mask of the week.
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:05.600]   I like this.
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:06.160]   I want it.
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:07.560]   It's called the humanity shield.
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:08.000]   Not cheap.
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.880]   It's $59.60.
[02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:11.880]   It's a face shield.
[02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:13.120]   But--
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:14.000]   It's kind of a nuns.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.200]   What do you call those nuns things?
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:16.440]   It's got a habit.
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:17.360]   A cowl.
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:18.560]   Yeah.
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:21.200]   So you're still breathing when the air is coming in.
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:22.880]   It's not coming from in front of you, obviously.
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:23.800]   It's coming through the back.
[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:25.960]   And the fabric--
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:27.480]   ah, it's really interesting.
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:28.040]   Wow.
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:29.240]   Wait, is there supposed to be--
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:30.720]   It's trying to combine--
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:32.720]   Is there supposed to be a plastic shield in front of you?
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:33.240]   Yeah.
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:33.240]   Yeah.
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:34.880]   If you go outside, you can see it.
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:36.080]   You can't really see it.
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:36.560]   Oh, OK.
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:37.240]   I was like--
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:37.880]   I don't understand.
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:38.440]   I don't understand.
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:38.720]   I understand.
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:39.920]   Yeah.
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:41.080]   They made it too clear.
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:41.960]   They really should have--
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:42.440]   OK.
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:45.520]   Oh, it's like the least effective mask ever.
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:46.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:48.200]   It's got a big hole in the front.
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:50.320]   That's really interesting.
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:52.120]   And this one people can see your face.
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:54.840]   I think it's you talking.
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:58.600]   Medical grade filtering barrier.
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:00.080]   And I'll have to read more about this.
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:05.800]   This is humanity's shield from rapidresponsepp.com.
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:08.520]   Not cheap, but you wouldn't need a whole bunch of them.
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:11.080]   I don't even know if you'd wash them, actually.
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:12.720]   Well, it's a bulk order price.
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:15.400]   10 to 49 shields at $49 each.
[02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:15.920]   Yikes.
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:16.920]   Yikes.
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:17.920]   Yikes.
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:20.080]   [WHISTLE]
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:23.080]   That's the mask of the week.
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:27.680]   And now I am going to yield the floor
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:36.280]   to my colleague from North Kacalaki, the right honorable.
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:37.240]   Is that how I say it?
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:38.240]   Did I say it right?
[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:39.080]   You said it right.
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:39.800]   North Kacalaki.
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:44.240]   North Kacalaki, Mr. the honorable, Mr. Ant Pruitt,
[02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:46.800]   has the floor.
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:52.720]   My pick of the week is I want to say thank you to Chad.
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:56.080]   And I mean, Chad Bozeman.
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:42:59.160]   The whole Chad-Wit Bozeman still throws me off,
[02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:01.640]   because I didn't know him by that name.
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:03.760]   I always knew him as Chad.
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:06.240]   I wanted to put this out there, because I
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:11.120]   know a lot of listeners are from my hometown of Anderson,
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:12.560]   South Carolina.
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:15.920]   And I felt that I owe it to them to bring this up
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:23.240]   in just a few minutes of what I know about Chad.
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:27.720]   Where I grew up, the house that my mother built,
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:34.040]   the land that she built it on, was owned by a Bozeman family.
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:37.200]   So my neighbors were Bozeman's.
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:40.400]   And there were two sisters that lived there
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:44.280]   that had another brother named Chad that he didn't live with them.
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:46.120]   But he would come by from time to time.
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:49.880]   And we would all hang out together, play basketball,
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:53.960]   and just be teenagers, just be kids and had a good time,
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:56.960]   taught a lot of junk, had a lot of fun.
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:59.680]   And Chad was special.
[02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:03.360]   He was a hell of an athlete that went to another high school
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:07.240]   in the area, not the same one that I went to,
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:10.600]   and just taught a lot of trash, heck of a competitor,
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:14.080]   really, really good at the sports.
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:16.760]   But beyond that, he was an interesting kid,
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:20.440]   because he wasn't like the rest of the kids that we all had
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:23.280]   the dreams and aspirations of going pro in this sport
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:25.760]   and going pro in that and whatever.
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:26.840]   But Chad was different.
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:28.600]   Chad was into debate.
[02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:30.600]   Chad was into theater.
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:35.120]   And he had divisions of being able to go to college
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:36.240]   to get into theater.
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:39.280]   And most people in our area didn't think that way.
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:45.960]   And you get ridiculed when you talk like that,
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:49.800]   depending on the area that you're from, if you know what I mean.
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:53.680]   And so he continued to go on, and I wasn't in touch with him
[02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:55.880]   much, but I was in touch with his sister,
[02:44:55.880 --> 02:44:58.800]   because again, they lived next door to us.
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:00.560]   And during this time of his passing,
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:04.240]   I really feel for her, because she
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:06.920]   kept us abreast of his progress and let us know
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:08.600]   what was going on with him.
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:14.600]   And I never really saw any of his movies until '42
[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:18.880]   with him portraying Jackie Robinson.
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:20.840]   But I heard about some of his stories
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:23.680]   of just being in New York and struggling, just like all
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:25.160]   actors do.
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:26.600]   But he kept pushing forward.
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:29.120]   And he also had the mission of saying, you know what?
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:31.520]   I actually want to make the story.
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:33.080]   I want to be in directing.
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:34.760]   I want to be in the writing.
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:38.480]   The acting stuff just happened.
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:40.400]   That wasn't even his main vision.
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:43.520]   His main vision was to just make the story.
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:48.040]   And when he got that opportunity to jump into Marvel
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:52.720]   and be the Black Panther, he just took that opportunity
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:56.160]   and just absolutely crushed it, considering all the things
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:45:58.520]   that he dealt with growing up, considering all the things
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:01.080]   that he was dealing with at the time.
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:03.120]   And it really resonated with me.
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:05.120]   I never go to the movie theaters.
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:06.760]   I hate the movie theater experience.
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:09.480]   The only time I've gone is for Star Wars.
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:11.200]   And that was because of the connection I have
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:13.080]   with my late father.
[02:46:13.080 --> 02:46:18.120]   But I did go see Black Panther because of Chad.
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:20.560]   And when I went to see Black Panther,
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:29.000]   it warned my heart to see that this man was a superhero.
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:32.600]   And in our area, superheroes didn't look like Chad.
[02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:33.840]   And it looked like me.
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:36.480]   They looked like this guy with a pomper door.
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:40.320]   Or there were no Black superheroes like that.
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:43.760]   And to see that he was able to bring that to life,
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:47.720]   and my kids could see there are superheroes out there
[02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:49.560]   that looks like us.
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:51.560]   We can still go out there and strive
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:54.840]   to do things beyond the basketball court
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:56.400]   and beyond the football field.
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:58.200]   We can go and write stories.
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:01.960]   We can go and make the story that we want to present
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:04.960]   and entertain millions around the world.
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:08.080]   And he put his guts into this.
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:10.360]   He was so serious about his craft.
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:14.800]   And he also wanted to make sure other people could prosper
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:16.680]   from his efforts as well.
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:19.880]   And I just wish that more people could understand
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:22.640]   the backstory behind Chad.
[02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:25.320]   Growing up in that tiny little town of Anderson,
[02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:28.600]   South Carolina, where there's not much going on there
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:30.680]   other than Clemson football.
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:33.480]   But he had a vision and he stuck with that vision.
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:37.920]   Thick and thin, getting more opportunities left and right
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:39.640]   that he had no control over it.
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:43.400]   There's the story of Denzel Washington helping him pay
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:47.200]   for his trip to go to Oxford and study, acting.
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:50.440]   Denzel freaking Washington.
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:54.400]   Then he gets back and he's been told no a gazillion times
[02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:58.080]   on set because he didn't fit this role, that role.
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:59.960]   Then there was another time in the soap opera
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:02.360]   where he was portrayed as a black man.
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:07.200]   But he didn't like how that role was being portrayed negatively.
[02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:10.560]   He spoke up about it and they took him off.
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:12.000]   But he said, you know what, it's okay,
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.400]   I still want to make the story.
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:15.480]   It's okay, I don't have to act.
[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:17.840]   I can just write and do my own stories.
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:19.760]   And then after that, all of these other doors
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:21.440]   just continue to pop up for him.
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:23.680]   And just keep pushing folks.
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:25.880]   Don't have ass life.
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:29.360]   We really do have a tremendous opportunity right now,
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:32.760]   even though this is COVID-19 and things are shutting down.
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:34.840]   If you have a passion about something right now,
[02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:36.160]   just keep going for it.
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:37.480]   Keep living it.
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:41.880]   Chad did it better than anybody that I can ever realize,
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:46.880]   considering everything that he dealt with with cancer.
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:51.120]   And people are complaining about wearing a damn mask.
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:55.800]   Walk in his shoes, do what he did.
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:48:57.800]   And just be better.
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:00.320]   And I just wanted to say, Chad, thank you so much, man,
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:03.920]   for representing our city, representing our state,
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:08.880]   and representing our people, resilience, brother.
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:11.240]   I love you and to your sister.
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:12.400]   I'm not gonna say your name.
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:13.920]   I'm thinking about you too,
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:16.920]   because you've lost not one sibling.
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:22.120]   It's 20 years and my heart goes out to you.
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:22.960]   I love you all.
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:24.040]   Thank you all.
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:24.880]   What a hero.
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:26.680]   That's beautiful.
[02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:27.880]   - Thank you for that.
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:29.560]   - And that's it for Twig.
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:30.400]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:31.560]   We'll see you next time.
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:32.400]   Bye bye.
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:35.880]   That was really great.
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:37.480]   Wow, I didn't know you knew.
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:39.600]   Oh well, holy cow.
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:42.000]   Wow, thank you, aunt.
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.360]   That was really from the heart.
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:49.080]   It's interesting how beloved he was in such a short career.
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:52.600]   But boy.
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:55.240]   And I'm not a Marvel fan.
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:57.080]   I'm not a Marvel fan by any means,
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:00.720]   but when I saw Black Panther, it was like, wow.
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:03.040]   Wow.
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:07.240]   Yeah, his sister used to send messages.
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:13.200]   And she'd say, "Look at my little brother."
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:15.040]   Just doing it up.
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:17.480]   And I would joke with her and say, "Yeah,
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:19.960]   that don't look like the same dude
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:22.240]   that used to whoop our ass in the face of a fuck.
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:25.160]   (laughing)
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:28.360]   He had already been diagnosed with colon cancer
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:30.160]   when he was doing Black Panther.
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:32.560]   Yeah, we knew Chad was different
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:36.360]   from a lot of the kids that we hung out with.
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:40.960]   He was likable and could party and all of that stuff
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:42.320]   just like any other teenager,
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:44.320]   but there was something different.
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:49.320]   And that whole theater life and the debate life,
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:53.760]   he wasn't like the rest of us and it showed.
[02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:55.640]   And he just kept pushing along.
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:50:56.480]   And it's...
[02:50:56.480 --> 02:51:03.080]   We should mention that the most liked tweet of all time
[02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:10.000]   was this tweet from his Twitter account,
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:11.460]   saying he'd passed away.
[02:51:11.460 --> 02:51:17.520]   7.6 million likes retweeted 3.1 million times.
[02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:22.360]   Well, it says something too about the coverage
[02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:26.280]   in having covered entertainment industry.
[02:51:26.280 --> 02:51:31.320]   It shows how not to racialize it,
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:35.920]   but white controlled media just didn't understand
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:40.200]   how huge he was until they started hearing the reaction
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:43.480]   that how profound a sadness this was.
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:48.320]   Yeah, I got the message from my mom
[02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:53.120]   when it happened and I was like, wait a minute,
[02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:54.760]   no, this can't be real.
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:51:58.880]   And then my son, they sent me a message because I was out.
[02:51:58.880 --> 02:52:02.040]   They sent me a message and it just broke their hearts
[02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:05.120]   and then my phone started hanging from people from back East,
[02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:07.960]   just like this can't be real.
[02:52:07.960 --> 02:52:12.320]   And being able to hear everybody else's story,
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:15.360]   it just further proved how much that catch
[02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:20.360]   is just really meant to all of us from the area.
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:22.480]   No, I didn't keep in touch with Chad.
[02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:24.480]   There's no way I could keep in touch with Chad.
[02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:25.840]   It's just, it is what it is.
[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:28.160]   And I was never upset about that,
[02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:32.840]   but I really appreciated what he represented from the area
[02:52:32.840 --> 02:52:36.040]   because y'all know how it is in the South.
[02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:39.640]   You've heard the horror stories that I've told about the South
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:43.440]   and this being the so-called land of opportunity,
[02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:46.880]   it was great to see that he was able to take his opportunities
[02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:49.000]   and just really maximize it.
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:53.400]   And then beyond that, give back to everybody else
[02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:55.240]   and just say, hey, you can do this too.
[02:52:55.240 --> 02:52:57.200]   So get on out there, do the work,
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:52:58.920]   get slapped in the face a couple of times,
[02:52:58.920 --> 02:53:00.400]   but just keep going at it.
[02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:01.240]   And you know what?
[02:53:01.240 --> 02:53:05.960]   You can be a freaking superhero that we used to dream about
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:08.560]   and look at on the TV screens and movie screens
[02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:09.440]   when we were kids.
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:12.720]   And I never, ever would have assumed something like that
[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:16.920]   would have happened until seeing that with my own eyes.
[02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:18.880]   - It's kind of amazing, yeah.
[02:53:18.880 --> 02:53:23.880]   And what a, I think he made 42 third good martial
[02:53:23.880 --> 02:53:27.680]   and Black Panther are three movies
[02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:32.200]   that must mean so much to Black children
[02:53:32.200 --> 02:53:36.400]   and just Black people in general about achievement
[02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:39.040]   in not just in sports, but you know,
[02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:41.120]   as a Supreme Court justice
[02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:44.520]   and King of Wakanda, which is pretty good.
[02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:45.360]   - Yep.
[02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:46.520]   - If you can make it to King of Wakanda,
[02:53:46.520 --> 02:53:47.800]   you can make it anyway.
[02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:48.640]   - Yep.
[02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:50.480]   I remember when I saw Black Panther,
[02:53:50.480 --> 02:53:53.320]   when we left the theater,
[02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:55.400]   I remember walking out of the theater
[02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:58.760]   and just sort of standing and just looking around
[02:53:58.760 --> 02:54:00.720]   and I was just taking it in.
[02:54:00.720 --> 02:54:03.680]   And it was Phoebe and I at that particular time,
[02:54:03.680 --> 02:54:05.760]   it was Phoebe and I, and I just stopped
[02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:08.120]   and we were just taking it in.
[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:10.080]   People were taking selfies.
[02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:11.160]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:12.680]   - It was so inspiring.
[02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:15.000]   - It was, it was, it was beautiful.
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.480]   - Yeah, it was really beautiful.
[02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:18.320]   It was really good.
[02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:19.240]   - Thank you for your generosity, Andrew.
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:20.160]   - Yeah, thank you.
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:23.000]   - Not easy, not easy to do that, but thank you.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.160]   - Yeah, really appreciate it.
[02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:26.200]   He was a great actor too.
[02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:28.880]   If you saw James Brown, you realize what it,
[02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:30.360]   I thought I was looking at James Brown.
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:31.360]   I was blown away.
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:32.440]   I couldn't believe he did James Brown.
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:33.280]   - Yeah, he did.
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:34.920]   - James Brown is amazing actor.
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:37.040]   - And I love the--
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:38.720]   - Started out with the soap operas.
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:40.280]   - Yeah.
[02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:42.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:46.400]   - Oh, but there's gonna be a tribute to him tomorrow
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:49.360]   in Anderson at the Civic Center.
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:50.200]   - Oh wow.
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:53.720]   - It's been some art shared and things like that.
[02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:54.560]   - You go back?
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:56.000]   - I guess you can't really go back, huh?
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:57.560]   - You should go, I wish you could.
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:54:59.560]   - No, it's a family house still there,
[02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:01.360]   is your mom still there?
[02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:03.200]   - Oh yeah, my mom's isn't moving anywhere.
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:05.520]   She had that house built and it's been there
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:08.240]   for as long as I can remember.
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:11.920]   And there's that whole area.
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:17.560]   Oh man, it's the Bozeman land.
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:19.920]   That's how small the town was,
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:23.040]   which it's huge compared to where I live now
[02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:24.600]   here in Northern California.
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:27.040]   But that's how small that area was,
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:30.120]   it's just all families clump together
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:32.640]   and this is our land and we all live together
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:33.480]   and we love each other.
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:34.880]   We're all related to each other.
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:39.160]   It's just different there, you know.
[02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:44.960]   - Yeah, well maybe someday we'll get to go back and visit.
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:47.360]   - Indeed.
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:49.680]   - I'd love to meet your mom.
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:50.760]   - Yes, yes.
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:53.800]   All right, Ed, thank you.
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:54.640]   - Thank you all.
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:57.040]   - Thank you. - Thank you very much for that.
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:57.880]   - Yeah, I'll take care.
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:55:59.040]   - All right, take care.
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:01.620]   (upbeat music)
[02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:04.200]   (upbeat music)
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:06.780]   (upbeat music)
[02:56:06.780 --> 02:56:09.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
