[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Coming up next on this week in Google, I'm Jason Howell. I'm here with Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higabotha
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.240]   We're gonna talk a little bit about Android P because apparently the developer preview launched today
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.320]   Also Google is apparently working with the Department of Defense on analyzing drone footage
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.840]   That's a little weird Facebook is searching for the line between satire and fake news and your Amazon Echo is laughing at you
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.320]   How does that feel all that more coming up next on this week in Google?
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.880]   Netcast you love from people you trust
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:46.440]   This is Twitter bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly C A C A G F L Y
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.440]   .com
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.280]   This is Twig this week in Google episode number 447 recorded on Wednesday March 7th 2018
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.280]   Geothermal it
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.720]   This week in Google is brought to you by Lighthouse with 3d and AI
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.240]   Lighthouse is the only camera that gets your busy life at home get 15% off a lighthouse camera with a promo code Twit at
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.880]   light dot house
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google and this week
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.640]   There's a lot of Google actually our doc is filled with Google and I'm excited about that
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640]   I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo who
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.120]   Well, I feel like every time I fill in for Leo. I say he's gallivanting. He's not quite gallivanting yet
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.840]   He's more in transit so that he can get to South by Southwest and then Gallivant a little bit
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.440]   So I'm happy to fill in for Leo. I'll do my best to fill in for him anyways
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.200]   Joining us, you know, I'm you'll love him at least I think you love him Jeff Jarvis buzz machine calm professor at the CUNY school of
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.960]   Journalism how's it going Jeff all right? I was trying to show you the outside. Oh, what's going on outside camera? Oh
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.660]   Is it snowing you can't see it's white is white is white out. Yeah. Oh wow. That's how you should be in Austin
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.600]   Let's see Jeff ready. I've lost two droves. Oh Stacy. That's me
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.080]   Sunny and beautiful look at all that green on the trees you could actually see the green on the trees anything no
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.640]   Stacy Higabolo white creator of the IOT podcast at IOT podcast calm and so many other things
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.160]   How you doing Stacy? I'm doing super well. It's a beautiful sunny day in Austin
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   It's been awesome if Leo had planned his travels so he could just like pop in that door right behind me
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160]   And just be like hello guys
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160]   As long as you let him in downstairs first
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:50.760]   Like I'm coming she can do that remotely because she's Stacy. That's true. You are you are the the queen of IOT
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.680]   Last week last week
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.480]   She ran out of things
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.440]   She had no things there was no things very upset
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.240]   Have you gotten more things Stacy? So this isn't a physical thing, but it's it applies to the things
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.320]   I do have some more things that I'm now testing, but they're not really I mean the internet is filled with things
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.520]   That's why they call it the Internet of things there are things all over the US Stacy went through everything there was
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.640]   All the things there was no thing left well
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.780]   Thankfully it only takes a week to regenerate new things and so I have a feeling that's gonna be a change for this week
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.760]   We'll check in on that later. I thought we were going in like reverse order and we're gonna kind of change things
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.600]   We'll save it for the end
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.320]   So I had time to kind of poke through and read all this stuff
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.440]   I will I will say one thing before we kind of get into the show that in
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.040]   Times past when I've done this week in Google. I've also been doing a daily tech news show that's called tech news today
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.480]   well, we don't do that anymore and I realize how
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.920]   Little more challenging it is to drop into twig when you're not like
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.160]   Knows to the news every single day every single story that comes through so I spent good good amount of time reading through a lot
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   Of these Google stories. I didn't work up a good like direction or thread to them
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.360]   So it's it's taken as it goes man. Take it as it goes. All right. Yeah
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.680]   Normally you're usually
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.920]   Whereas the rest of us are like la la la la. I don't know well sure so I mean obviously we should start with
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.760]   Quantum chips, right? Because that's because that's totally where our strengths lie as a as a team
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.480]   Would you say? Yeah?
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.280]   We might as well. I know that's that's reason enough
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.440]   Google is claiming to be near
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.240]   Quantum supremacy they say
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.120]   And apparently this is a thing. That's the moment that quantum computers can outperform a
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.840]   Traditional computer Google doesn't isn't saying that they're necessarily there yet, but they're developing a 72
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.800]   Cubit processor, which is apparently a step up well
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.920]   It's definitely a step up from the nine cubit design that they showed off back in 2014
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.720]   It's called bristlebone. How many how many
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.920]   When I was cubit was our that was cubits with the sea
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.520]   Bible I'm gonna guess 40 but probably not
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.600]   How many cubits was Noah's Ark
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:33.400]   Heart they hear it it was 300 cubits
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.120]   30 cubits and height 300 cubits in length so Google you got a ways to
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.720]   Google not more popular than God but then Jesus
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.160]   Bristleton needles. Yeah, I know I'm getting my wires crossed. I apologize
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.880]   Bristle cone is basically their research testbed for all this stuff
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.640]   scaling
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.920]   error rates all that kind of stuff with machine learning of course because Google loves its machine learning and
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.680]   Google's saying it's cautiously optimistic that bristle cone can outperform a classical computer
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.320]   sometime soon
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.400]   So quantum computing that's about all I got
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.880]   Now explain this to me. How could it just be at the point of being in a computer?
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.120]   I thought that the whole point of quantum was it was already
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.320]   Way steps ahead. Why is it why is it that so that's that's what I'd like to talk about because that's what I was hoping for
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.960]   Normal computing goes one way
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:41.840]   That it functions in a complete quantum computers function in a completely different way. So basically saying it's better than a classical computer
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   It's kind of like saying
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   I'm trying to think of a good
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.800]   like that case. Oh is better than
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.000]   The case. Oh
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.200]   No, I was thinking like humans can swim as well as fish or something like that is it's
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.080]   There's totally different mechanisms of ways to go about it
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.640]   We swim in a completely different way than a fish if that makes sense. So this is a terrible analogy, but so
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.280]   What the simulations they're performing on a classical computer and to get to that level you don't need as many qubits
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:26.280]   To go beyond which is where everyone's excited about and worried because this could you know break like AES encryption at its highest levels
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   Which I think is 256 right now
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.480]   So we're gonna quickly get to that point but we're not there yet
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.000]   And so but this is still exciting because once you unleash a quantum computer. We're not exactly sure
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.680]   how it works exactly it's not exactly a Schrodinger's cap problem, but
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.040]   We can't like check its work
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.080]   Except by comparing it to normal computing simulations. Did that make any sense? Was that at all helpful?
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.760]   I mean that that makes us about as much sense as quantum computing ever actually does like I know technical level to me
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.760]   I understand that it's really important and that it's a it's a big wave
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.880]   What you're describing actually really kind of reminds me of what we've been hearing the last couple years about this buzzword
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:16.120]   We can't stop hearing about which is artificial intelligence and stuff that it's doing all of this learning and all this all these calculations on its own
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.000]   It's not nearly as easy. It's it's not the same thing as saying hey, let's look at the code
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.160]   It's more like hey, let's look at the
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:29.280]   Results and that's about as clear as it gets if I understand even understand how artificial intelligence
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.000]   computing works so
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.880]   That's yeah, that's close close enough good enough. Yeah, cuz like a
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.880]   Cubit is like it's like a bit right like a binary bit except it has so much more information potential so
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.520]   72-bit computer would be nothing, but a cubit is obviously way more in
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.520]   encompasses way more information. I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to explain this
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.760]   I think I understand
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.960]   But with if quantum computing has the potential to break things like a s encryption and everything
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.520]   I mean
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.040]   I'm trying to understand like is that good overall like it will that then spawn even more secure systems?
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.600]   Let's say because it's so hyper capable of this sort of
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.800]   Mathematic most people look at it as being like a Y2K problem times a gajillion because
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.440]   There's so much that revolves right now on AES encryption and we don't currently have an alternative
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:36.920]   There is actually a company called secure RF that has just been certified a couple weeks ago by NIST as being
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.680]   Quantum unbreakable
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.640]   But to explain how that works
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.520]   I would have to send you their white paper that has a lot of equations and math in it because I don't actually understand how it works
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.280]   I had them explain it to me and it didn't penetrate at all there was a lot of math
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.360]   But I can direct you to it. I can send you a link to it
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.880]   And I will glance at the white paper and you will see the equations and you will go
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:06.760]   I will go why did I ever start the show with quantum computing and things we can't explain
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   And next week blockchain
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.320]   Yes, let's put the whole
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.280]   Actually easier. I know it is a lot easier. It probably is but I get equally confused with blockchain
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:24.920]   I can probably understand a little bit more about blockchain. I get it's it's it's the way the presumptions people make when they apply it to something
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:32.540]   Well, of course, it's gonna affect the the fruit industry by enabling you to understand where the cum what came from
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.840]   We all know that Jeff. We all know that
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.880]   Let's see here. What else you know actually I'm now realizing I started with Google
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.880]   I could have so easily started with the big
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.080]   Google news at least in the Android world. So why don't we start there? Yeah
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.280]   Really
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.760]   Yeah, okay, so let's talk about this because I think there's a lot to be said about this so
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:07.700]   Today I was predicting that Android P the next version at least the developer preview of the next version of Android
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:13.680]   Was gonna release on Pi day. There was some sort of it which is three, you know March 14th 3.14
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.040]   It just made sense right Android P Pi Pi is delicious
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.480]   Why wouldn't Google do that and of course they wouldn't do that because that was too obvious. That's how Google does things
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:29.960]   Android P is now a thing starting today. It exists if you're a daring individual
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.480]   Who likes to install potentially buggy software on your device go for it?
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:42.320]   Although I think most people that are writing about this are saying don't actually do that unless you have a spare device to put it on
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.560]   And it has to be a pixel this time around so they're allowing you to
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:53.240]   Load this through the SDK so you got to do them the full manual approach in order to get it on there
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.840]   It has to be a pixel device is not gonna work on any of Google's other devices at this stage
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.520]   It's not even gonna work through the beta channel. So if you opt in through the easy beta channel through your Google account
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:10.360]   It's not even an option yet. So they're probably waiting for a more stable version of this before you'll be able to do that
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.760]   But among the changes yes a lot of changes here
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.920]   I think and I think it's too early to know
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.760]   Like how these compare to what we'll see when it releases
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.880]   Officially in months down the line because usually with these developer previews we see little bits and pieces and over the coming months
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.680]   We'll find out a little bit more things might go away and everything like that
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:41.000]   But notification improvements so the full notification panel top to bottom is now redesigned you can see this these are
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.560]   pictures of the Android P notification
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:52.320]   Shade and it's all white. There's no transparency. It's solid white kind of similar to what we've been seeing a lot with material design
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   kind of a broader card based
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.480]   System you also see inline photos there so inside notifications
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.280]   You're gonna get more context around things like messaging
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:08.320]   So you can for instance on the left side you see an inline photo actually as part of the notification on the right side
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.600]   You see a conversation so instead of just showing you the notification
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:17.480]   Of the message that just came through it's gonna show you a few of the messages prior as well
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.000]   So you get a little bit of attic lance of an I just love notifications
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.480]   Let me act in the notification. Yeah, just hope there's more of that. Well, it seems like it seems like there is
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.400]   They have the kind of the smart replies integrated in so on that right side screenshot
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.600]   You can see some of those or even the smart replies. Oh, yeah
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.360]   Into the system which I'm not surprised at all that they're going that route
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:48.840]   And that just allows you at a glance to be able to use your notification even further to hopefully avoid you know
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   Having to jump into an app
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.000]   Every single time you get a notification to do some by the way
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Just a question while we're on smart replies just a little little tight detour
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.980]   Just just one black detour detour away the smart replies
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:08.840]   Universal in the sense does it you know see you there is what everybody says or if you're in a certain age group doesn't say
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.360]   awesome
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.720]   Smart replies from what I understand smart replies are tailored to you
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:22.360]   So they actually have insight into and depending on the implementation they have that insight into your location
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.680]   They have insight into your speaking style how you would reply to these certain things
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:32.680]   They're taking that all into factor into account to hopefully give you a reply that speaks in your voice
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.240]   Really?
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:41.440]   Mine all this this explains much because mine all involved a lot of exclamation points
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.720]   I just assume this was just Google getting super excited about things
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.440]   But maybe it's me being super excited about Google is reflecting your excitement
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.400]   Do you use a lot of exclamation points? I?
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:15:00.440]   Sort of do I am enthusiastic but and it yeah, I I but
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.200]   Yeah, okay, yes
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.320]   Gazums good thing
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.480]   It's working. That's awesome. Well do people do be I asked once if people knew that I was using?
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.560]   You know because I use them actually a lot. They're very helpful to me
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.400]   So I I'm like yeah
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.000]   You do that to them no one's been insulted yet
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.920]   But I'm waiting for Google to do the I will honor the embargo because that currently is never one of my replies
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:33.040]   And that would be awesome. I fly to have yes fine. I'll honor the embargo. Yeah
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.600]   Yeah, but but but at the same time if you make honoring an embargo
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.280]   Such an impulsive button tap you might not remember that you did that later
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.760]   It's probably best that you have to type that out. It's almost like you're writing your signature like yes
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.440]   I will wow you you take your embargoes. I mean I've never broken an embargo
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.000]   Oh, I have once accidentally but I rarely do the embargo thing to be honest
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.640]   So I'm like
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.680]   It's hard to not talk about things if I don't know about that well
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.880]   But then I want to know about them anyways. I certainly wasn't on the embargo that lifted at 10 a.m. For Android P developer preview
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   That's for sure
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.680]   As far as notifications, I think that's it based on what we've seen right now
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.440]   But I'm sure there will be more like I said other features indoor Wi-Fi positioning
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.040]   So you've ever been inside and you're doing any sort of the navigation?
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.760]   You know anything and you realize that your GPS signal is lost or weak or whatever
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.520]   This is a way around that is basically based on Wi-Fi round trip time
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:44.040]   Which can calculate positioning indoors when GPS fails if three or more access points are in range?
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:50.440]   So it can kind of triangulate your location within I think one to two meters when you're indoors and
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:57.760]   Oh, that seems like a signal for you know certain maps capabilities you already have like indoor mapping
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.080]   I think in some regards
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.640]   But this whole I thought they had been using Wi-Fi for better geo positioning
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:08.200]   For a long time in it including indoors. I mean they had the whole sky hook deal
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:14.920]   So I'm curious what is it just more granular at this level? It must be yeah because I know I
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.160]   Know what you're talking about there, too
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:23.480]   This seems a little bit more specific like I don't know if what you're talking about is as fine
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.680]   of detail is like one to two meters or
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:34.720]   You know is that is what you're talking about capable of doing like step-by-step navigation inside of a
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.320]   Building I'm not quite so sure
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:43.520]   Okay, I would imagine that I would be relying on GPS in that regard and this would hopefully remove you from that so
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.100]   I guess we will see so notch Jeff you mentioned the notch
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.720]   See notches gonna be notches gonna be one of those words of 2018. I think it's so
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.600]   stupid
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   All right
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:05.320]   Oh, cuz it's it's it's no no Steve Jobs would never ever have allowed the notch. Yeah, it is a design
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.160]   Sin
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:15.080]   If you want to have you know a screen with two little ears that do different things and I'm fine
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:21.120]   But the ears is okay, but to make it as if God made screens with notches come on come on stop stop
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.960]   And then copying Apple why come on Google have some spine
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.400]   Well, but are they copying Apple essential had the notch first?
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:37.320]   I mean technically they had the first device that released with the notch that I can remember anyway copying stupidity. Why?
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.600]   Everybody's jumping on the notch bandwagon. It seems like
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.560]   So I did a switch with mega moroni
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.520]   Where I use the iPhone 10 for six weeks?
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.720]   She surprised me with that. I thought it was gonna be a month and end up being six weeks little long
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.920]   But anyways, she got the pixel 2 XL
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.440]   I got the iPhone 10 and I have to say like in my time with it like the notch really did not bug me at all
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:04.920]   It was fine like I understand over time. I kind of understood why like I get the fact that
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:13.160]   People have more of an expectation now or maybe hardware manufacturers have instilled more of an expectation in people to have
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:20.040]   Their displays go to the edge. We also expect for sensors and certain things to be up at the top of the phone
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.960]   This would be a way to accomplish both
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.360]   I guess in my use it didn't really bug me that much and I thought it was gonna totally bug me
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.560]   But it it really didn't so I guess to some degree I'm kind of like whatever
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.320]   You know it
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.800]   Reminds me of people who watch DVDs and widescreen versus full screen. Yeah, yeah
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:44.280]   You know it feels kind of like that kind of debate where you know eventually when you're watching the movie if the movie's good
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.000]   You just focus on the movie, right? You're not really focused on
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.000]   The lightness whatever right so that's kind of how I look at the notch
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.920]   But I am not a die-hard. I do not have Jeff's passion for this issue
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.280]   So like that well and I think that they're probably so and they've made they've made some other changes
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:09.760]   Which we'll talk about in a second that seemed to be inspired by the the reality that is the notch the impending notch
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.200]   But I think that they're also building in
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:19.560]   Smarts to allow you for like you go into immersive mode, which is the full screen say you're watching a movie movies a prime example
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.840]   Instead of giving you the movie with the notch out of the side of it for some for no real good reason
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.360]   And then you miss out on that portion of the video or movie that you're watching
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:34.200]   It would have the ability to in immersive mode cut off the notch so that you still get your square
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.960]   It's still a very large screen. It's just way it should be anyway
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.960]   Yeah, I mean exactly
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:46.360]   All you need is kind of a little line there so the screen has its logical basis. Yeah, I'm not not
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.240]   Not the notch
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:55.080]   But they're also they're also making changes to the status bar up at the top and one of the big ones
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:01.640]   This seems to be getting the news right now is the fact that they're putting the clock on the left hand side of the screen
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:07.040]   Which when you think about an OS that has support for a notch and if there are gonna be more phones
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:13.240]   Potentially, I'll just throw this out there potentially a pixel three that has a notch the same crazier things could happen
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.080]   That at least puts the clock on one side
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.120]   Versus everything being weighted onto the right side so it more evenly distributes
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:29.800]   What you have up there and some people are seeing the clock on the left side is being a notch influence decision
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.520]   Oh
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.160]   Notch gate i'm looking at my phone i'm like, okay now i'm gonna have to train my brain
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.240]   to look at the clock on the other side
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.560]   Yeah, I know it's the worst thing in the world, isn't it
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.600]   change
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:53.000]   What else there are some requirements so like kind of underneath the hood maybe less ui more
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.960]   Underneath the hood developers will have a requirement to target modern versions of android
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.240]   So they can't up they won't be able to update their apps
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:09.240]   Past a given date without actually updating it to entirely to the latest api level
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.040]   So that's gonna require developers that want to update their apps to keep things
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.680]   Current and in the past
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.960]   You know developers who didn't want to support a certain feature or whatever have been able to continue developing their apps
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.120]   But still targeting you know last years of the year before his api
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.320]   So that they wouldn't have to kind of update and bring everything else to a certain level
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.960]   Google's putting in the requirement that basically says after a certain date that they will determine
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:42.120]   With each version of android if you are going in to make any update to your app beyond that date
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.720]   And you're still targeting older apis. You won't be able to make that update
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.640]   You're gonna have to it's gonna force you to update to that modern api level
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:55.080]   That's gotta be good for security reasons for keeping everything consistent
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.240]   Also for encouraging developers to actually support some of these new features instead of
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.000]   You know instead of putting it off, but it is definitely google kind of
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.280]   You know stepping on the toes of developers and saying we know what's better for you than you do so just do this
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:14.360]   So I don't know how much that's really going to get on anybody's nerves. I'm sure someone developers won't like that very much
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.640]   Um
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.640]   What else?
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.960]   Lots of little things. I mean, this is the first developer preview so that you know there's a camera api
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.120]   Yes multi-camera. Thank you
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.720]   um
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:34.680]   I don't I don't really know what this what the exact details about that are other than that it will support multi cameras
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.640]   Uh
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:41.320]   With the api and they say that will enable you to do creative things, you know with that official support
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.720]   What are creative things? I don't know
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.320]   Well, I think that's the whole uh what's the camera that does the the depth of field
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.720]   Like what a focus on later light draw right?
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.960]   Eventually ready you could do that
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   Yeah, well, yeah, it's it's supporting
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.680]   Regulation those sorts of things. Yeah on the system level instead of requiring
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:04.760]   Right, you know that hardware manufacturers or developers to kind of come up with their own unique ways to to tackle it. So
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.360]   Open mobile api for NFC payments. Uh, oh, I missed that. What's that all about?
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:16.760]   I have that from the android police one. Oh, I'll be able to access secure elements and enable smart card payments
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.280]   Okay
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.640]   from an api
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.000]   Not bad
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.520]   That would be nice
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.480]   Um, does anyone do you guys use google pay? No
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.040]   No, my credit card my credit card will go does it accept it
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.000]   Okay. Oh, that's a bummer
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.440]   You choose another one. Yeah, I would. Yeah. Yeah. Do you uh, stacey? No, I
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.160]   I had it on like I want to say an older phone, maybe
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.320]   But at that point in time no one took it so then I didn't add it now
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.480]   I'm kind of like uh should I try it again?
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.240]   I have been struck by jealousy when people walk up with their phones and they be
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.680]   Like I could be that it's nice when we don't I haven't even gotten to the point. I don't even
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.160]   Use the uh starbucks order a head app
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.000]   I do I just have such a creature old habit
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.320]   Is it working? Yeah, well, sometimes it takes so I actually was in and line at the airport at a long starbucks
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.960]   like a really long line
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.920]   And the guy in front of me did a mobile order
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.640]   And he and I picked ours up at the exact same time because he I guess he thought he was going to take
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   So the answer is by the time I think about it. I'm usually are yeah
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.240]   in the starbucks
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.480]   Sometimes I do it for my car before I walk into the starbucks, but then I feel really silly
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.720]   I don't know
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.880]   All right. I also the thing that has me upset about this update. Yeah
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.760]   Is there cutting off
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.720]   Old nexus phones and the pixel c tablet
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.400]   Yeah
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:54.520]   They are so nexus 5x nexus 6p and pixel c no longer supported
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.600]   It's been confirmed no longer supported with the dev preview and then of course they looked into it
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:05.240]   Rana mojio at ours technica asked google and google said officially that those devices will not be getting android p
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.680]   When it releases though they will be getting monthly security updates through november of this year
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.840]   And then I think the monthly updates will the pixel c is still really useful
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.920]   I mean if I could still use my nexus 7 I would it's a wonderful device
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:25.800]   That's so less than c's irritating. Yeah, so funny that you mentioned that berk here at the studio showed me an x is 7
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.960]   Just a few an hour ago and he was like so I just got this what can I do with it?
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.840]   I'm like, I don't think you got a whole lot of options on that thing. You know, they're a whole lot. That's a great
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:40.440]   Yeah, I saw it's my school. They're putting some old tablets on classrooms so they can have a display of what it's available
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.080]   Something rent and they you know smashed up an old nexus 70 that's all it's good for now and it hurt
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:51.080]   You know, there's a lot of there's a lot of camera software like turn your phone into a camera
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.800]   So like people power makes one so that's an option
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:03.960]   Yeah, I love the nexus 7 because it actually fit in my rear pocket. Yeah. Yeah, it had the pocket ability pocket ability factor
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.360]   It did it did it's great. So that's that's gone and my and I do carry around
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:13.720]   The pixel book now everywhere. I travel with it. Yeah, but it was wonderful traveling with the pixel C in the keyboard
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.240]   It was just great
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:21.720]   But how does that compare then to the pixel book? I mean kind of same same problem is the pixel here's the problem
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.960]   I'll tell you dr. Android. I will tell you
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   Um, I find that android on the pixel book is just not ready for prime time. Yeah
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.000]   Uh a lot of things just don't operate very well
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.880]   uh, you know, I'll get times when uh netflix
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.200]   I've got to try to
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.320]   Restart it 10 times and doesn't know that it's there and some apps are still small and it's just not
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.040]   It's just not there and not ready and so for chrome to what I love chrome is it os
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.360]   But for chrome to be the primary os on the device with android apps as well
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:57.560]   No, it's it's just smooth. The operation. I think to work on an android device
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.200]   Through the web
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.120]   Yeah, but then but then the uh the uh the the the keyboard functionality of the android device like the v
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   I don't know. I just I find the pixel seat can't let's say the board was great. You had a pixel seat in you
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.880]   I yeah, I had the pixel c. I have the key board. The keyboard was great. The keyboard was all right
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.040]   I don't know. I just you know what I never forced
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.960]   I never forced myself to live with it though
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.200]   And I think you probably need to kind of overcome that hurdle to really get to that. I don't know Jason
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.800]   I don't know Jason. You can live with the notch but not the pixel seat keyboard. I
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.960]   That question you're judgment
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.440]   Uh, I don't know it's easier for me to overlook the notch but the the keyboard if it's if it's a keyboard
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:40.680]   I don't like and and I think the the more the more pressing thing for me is that I just don't feel like android
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.160]   OS was a very uh
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:49.960]   Productivity like it wasn't very good. It's not it's not that's true. It's terrible. Yeah, that's why I've been
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:57.800]   Yeah, I'm with you. Yeah, and so so I mean even if I was to get myself over the keyboard aspect like I just don't enjoy working in
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:03.720]   Android for those types of things I much more enjoy the chrome OS experience for that
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:10.840]   So maybe I'm biased the pixel seat came out in 2015 December 2015. So it's now three years old
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:17.480]   Believe well. Well, no, sorry two and a couple of months. So I guess it's just officially beyond its time
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.720]   You know, I saw a study a couple weeks ago
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:27.800]   A mobile device and this is on mobile devices and it was from uh cet and charma. It was his end of year study
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.120]   They said that the average life of handsets in the us is now three years
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.040]   So
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.000]   Having less than a three year. I know that's surprise
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   It's sort of surprising and sort of not surprising. I mean devices are super expensive. There's no studies now
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.240]   so
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:51.560]   It feels like a three years should be then looking at your minimum support time for these devices for everyone who's not
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:56.920]   And this isn't the people watching the show, but you know the rest of them for your aunt and uncle
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.320]   I just I was just I saw some old friends
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.360]   The other day and and the and the father is is very old now. He's in 90 something and he's
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:10.760]   His his wife died something like four years ago. He still has the flip phone because it still has her picture on it
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.920]   And he'll open up the flip phone many times a day just to look at the picture
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:19.000]   You know, there's reasons people a lot of these things that you can't imagine. Yeah, and
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.960]   The plan is planned up to lessons. It's it's it's the sin that we talked about for years and in capitalism
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.280]   And now it's not always
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:34.200]   It's not always planned obsolescence in some cases there are legit things like security charges
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.200]   How how many people do you want?
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:42.360]   Working on that and then there's also like actual hardware elements and you know apple just got in trouble with this with the battery
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:48.280]   They were making a decision from an engineering stand. You're right. Yep. Yep. I mean, I'm not saying that
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.720]   There isn't an element of that, but I don't think it's always evil
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.880]   I think sometimes it's just a perspective that we don't respect in the tech industry
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.400]   Right. I think you're right and I think I think that that there should be
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.920]   A principle that's a company comes out and says we will support devices for this minimum on time three years
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.560]   and and past that
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.320]   Will continue security updates for two years something like that
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:17.160]   Right that says that when you make an investment and it is an investment for a lot of people and we're one percenters in the tech world
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.600]   Well, because we'll spend the money as if we even if we don't have it to get the latest thing
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.920]   That's just not true of a lot of people
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.000]   So so so official support like we support it for three years that is
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.080]   Keeping it up to date on up on the major OS updates
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:37.160]   For that. I would argue for that. Yeah, I mean, you know the the other challenge of this
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.720]   I think you guys were kind of touching on this a little bit like using birk as the example with the nexus seven
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.680]   Is that he pointed out to me that it's actually running android seven on it right now
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.000]   So I mean it's relatively modern version of the os orio is eight
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:57.000]   Lm and what is it nougat is seven? So it's only one official
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.960]   That's really released version behind yet. He says it's slower than molasses
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.320]   You know and so great. It has the latest version of you know one of the more recent versions of android on it
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.360]   But it's that doesn't necessarily make it better to use it actually slows it down and the
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.120]   Well, you know those two
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.840]   Is the other is the vendor problem we we tend to buy
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.240]   Pure android
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:26.040]   When we buy android, but when I go to india and see the phones there, you know, they're three versions back and that's what they're running. Yep
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:32.040]   Well android go hopefully we'll we'll address that. You know, I hope that yes, which um
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.040]   Yeah, are the new versions of android phones
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.640]   Sorry
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:44.920]   Um at the same time google does bring you know the new waui things the fact that google lens for example on the rundown is coming to all android phones
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:51.160]   That's cool, right? That's great. And but you can't do that on a old old old phone. I get that
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:57.720]   Yeah, and I mean even even even then a show of hands who's using google lens all the time on their
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.640]   That was my next question to you. Do you either of you use google lens? No, I did it once
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:07.320]   Existed yeah, that's a problem. That is the problem
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.920]   Especially when it's when it's baked into something like google photos like yeah, that gives everybody access to google lens
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:18.600]   And yes, it's neat when it works. I will say it does not work all the time even when you you know, you go to use it
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.960]   Uh depending on what you're pointing it to but you know, it's embedded in in your photos app and uh
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.920]   So it's a neat feature of that app, but it's not
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:32.840]   Revolutionary, it's not point your camera at something and it pulls up a link for you to buy something, you know immediately
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.240]   It's a little bit more kind of on the back end so speak. I suppose
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.800]   Yeah, it's rewarding but you know the other guys are asking to remind you too much
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:46.840]   I'm I'm I'm I phone the stupid squeeze thing drives me crazy. Oh me too. Thank you. I love the squeeze
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.920]   I love it squeeze. I love it so much. I hate the squeeze
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:58.040]   I hate the squeeze the you hate the nuts you hate the squeeze man. Jeff. What do you love? Get off my lawn modern technology
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.120]   Technology
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:07.320]   I agree with you though, jeff and uh and it was interesting because like I said mega and I switched phones
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:12.920]   So she had the pixel 2 XL for six weeks and I she was talking about the squeeze all the time
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:20.600]   She's like, oh, I love the squeeze how it summons assistant or whatever that the assistant is only ever summoned on the squeeze by accident for me
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:26.200]   It's never on for me. I put it in my in my um vent holder in the car
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:32.600]   Oh, and when I take it off it squeezes. Well, you can change the uh
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:39.880]   The sensitivity for this if you go you have to you have to train it system gestures active edge
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:46.760]   And there's a little slider here so that a light squeeze would pull it up easily a firm squeeze would pull it up a firm squeeze
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.160]   I'm the kind of a guy who gives a firm squeeze
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:55.240]   You know I love it for so my favorite thing to do with the squeeze is actually turn on the flashlight
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:01.800]   Uh, oh and I did because I've got it usually it's what I've stuck my phone someplace and I'm trying to find something
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.080]   I realize I can't see anything so then I'm like I squeeze it
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.840]   I'm like turn on flashlight and it's like what the and I'm like, haha
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.760]   but
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.080]   I don't know. That's just me. I'll offer you to do that
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.840]   I I lose a lot of things behind a lot of places Jeff
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.080]   It's very dark where I live. I don't know
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:25.320]   Um, I do want to add because someone's talking about it in the chat room
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.320]   I actually gave you a piece of software that they don't want they don't support it anymore
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.400]   So I'm offering you a different one to run on your old android device for security stuff
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.440]   It's a company called or a software called salient I
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.400]   And if you look that up
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:44.200]   You will you will see that you can download it and use it as a separate like camera
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.160]   It's not ideal, but I mean it's not going to function like an s cam
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.880]   But it is it has a point if you want to use it
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.800]   I mean
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.840]   Yeah, this and this is kind of what I was telling berg is like, you know
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.880]   Does your nexus seven really have a use as a traditional tablet in the way that you know
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:05.480]   You used it when it was first brand new and probably not diminishing definitely
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.640]   But there are a whole lot of ways that you can repurpose these devices, you know, like don't don't feel like your only recourse is to
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.920]   You know take it out back and and do the office space to it
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.400]   Take a hammer to it
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.480]   Like you could turn it into a security alarm system like you're saying or you could turn it into
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.600]   I saw something the other day that on xda where you can take
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.640]   And you know, well actually this was more raspberry pi but i'm sure you could do it with an old android device
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.440]   You know have it be the receiving screen
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.360]   That you amount in your car for android auto or something something along those lines
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.600]   You can get creative with it if you have the time
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.640]   The patience and the understanding to do it or you can give it to a kid and just tell him it's a
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:50.680]   Camera, I think my daughter. I don't know. She's still I had like a samsung three maybe and shoot
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.080]   She's still videotaping the dog with that and she's having a grandel time
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.600]   Great
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.840]   That works perfect. It's a good camp. Well, this is gonna
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   She wouldn't put
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:07.160]   Uh target clothes on her american girl doll. She's gonna get at some point that you're you're pulling one over on her
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.360]   Dude, she does not like technology. She is not
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.040]   Does not get designer treatment for her. It's like really
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:20.840]   I'm good with that actually. I'm like here. Yeah, you should be I don't know. I'll be happy with that. Yeah, yeah, I'm kidding
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.720]   Okay, then but otherwise it can cause you a fortune
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.000]   Right. She does have she does have a math book
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.640]   so
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.040]   Well in in our home we have nothing but android devices
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:40.520]   Not true. I do have an ipad, but that's really specifically for like music production sort of things
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.720]   Um, so it's not like our kids ever use the ipad
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.920]   yet because of things like youtube
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.360]   And i'm sure just popular media in general
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.840]   You know whenever my eight-year-old
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:58.200]   Brooches the conversation of of hey, I want to get some sort of piece of technology
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:05.160]   It's always labeled as ipad or iphone. So, uh, there's a brand awareness there even though in our home. It's all android
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:10.120]   I think it's just well. Can you hand her an old android phone and she'll be like, yeah, that's cool
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:15.720]   Or she actually want the iphone. No, I I don't think I think I probably could I mean her
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.000]   She has a tablet
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.600]   You know each of my girls have a tablet that they can use only on the weekends for a couple hours
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.160]   They're both android tablets and they don't care
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.720]   It's got the screen that gives them the thing that they want to watch, you know as far as that's concerned
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.200]   I'm sure there will be a time though when there are more
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.840]   Pressure in you know, there's more pressure in school and i've heard about that
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:41.560]   Anyways being being a thing where you know the the kids that surround you are well more brand aware
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.920]   And i'll be curious to see at that point if it makes a difference or not
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.400]   If it makes a difference between iphone and android, I guess we'll start saving up now Jason
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.480]   I know put it away as a budget item
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:56.440]   Those things aren't cheap
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.920]   Um, all right, so I think I mean there's there's a few other features, but they're really kind of
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.320]   nerding in the weeds and everything like that. I think ultimately we're gonna hear more
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:12.360]   About this at google.io in a come in a couple of months and probably there will be an update to this
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.080]   Android p developer preview in probably like a month month and a half. It seems to be what they do
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.280]   They do a little refresh every every other month, but um
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:27.320]   I'm really surprised to have a dessert. It is pie. No, no, no, it's not. I mean, it's never it presumes
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.320]   Oh
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.720]   Yeah, I don't know. What do you guys think? I I really thought that I didn't think that pie was gonna be
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.400]   Pie day at her pie would be perfectly but I thought that that made a lot of sense
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.840]   But is there a dessert that you hope it will be they don't they don't announce the name when they let out the developer preview
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:47.800]   Now they don't they would do that later. So it'd be a lot of after pie day. Yeah, okay
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.640]   I'm I'm fond of pazell's, but that's a pretty regional dessert
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:57.560]   But why not educate people about them because they're delicious pazell pazell pizel pizel
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.880]   E-l-l-e. I've never
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:04.360]   I think it's a it's like a waffle cone cookie kind of I don't know how to describe it. They're delicious
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:09.000]   They're not too sweet better than that. You know if they're gonna go brand name, you know what they do it's paz
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.800]   Oh
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:17.400]   Yeah, if they go brand name, that's a good one though because you could so see a paz dispenser of an android figure
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.040]   And
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.040]   The
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:25.560]   Put spony little green pizzas and you know when yeah, when you go to a google event their hand and those out left and right
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.200]   Inside
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:35.320]   Yeah, yeah, I heard paz is an option, but that's a really good one android paz swag. Oh, oh
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:41.400]   A giant paz dispenser. I could just see it right now. Yeah, people would love that. You're right do it then
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   Get on that train paz
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.440]   Here's your marketing opportunity Google Google people if you're listening you're welcome
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:54.200]   You'll be getting a shipment of a google paz. Yeah, if you get a google paz dispenser
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.280]   I would like one. Thank you, Jeff
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.360]   Or at least just a piece of paz from it. No, no no paz candy is nasty
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:05.320]   Um, was he google with a little
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.960]   Okay, okay. Go google could do the paz strip of
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:17.080]   In the google colors too. The candies could come out in google colors. Yeah. Yeah, or or the candies could be little android figurines
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.840]   Now you're getting horrible that would die they wouldn't fit they would jam the dispenser
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:29.400]   They jam the dispenser. Yeah, well they make the same shape, but they'd etch into them etch in you could do that. Yes, you could
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.640]   see
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.600]   I like a little product marketing meeting. Okay, here you go
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.680]   and
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.800]   Speaking of product marketing it's time to take a break actually
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:45.080]   We're going to talk a lot more about other google stuff not not android stuff. I think we've kind of
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:50.360]   Hashed out most of what we know about android p. Maybe there's a few other tidbits in there
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:55.720]   But definitely diving into more google, but I hear I hear leo has something to tell you
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:03.160]   Hey, Jason. Hey, jeff. Hey stacey. I'm sorry. I'm not here. I you know i'm on my way to Austin for our big event
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:10.040]   On friday at south by south west, but I I had to just jump in for a moment to tell you about this thing
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.480]   I love
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.840]   This thing and stacey you were the one who told me about the lighthouse
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.560]   The lighthouse. I don't even want to call it a camera. It is a camera, but it's so much more
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.960]   It's a microphone. It's a speaker. It's got built-in artificial intelligence
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.600]   It's the only camera that gets your busy life. You can't always be home
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:34.200]   But if you have kids pets a nanny a dog walker and other people coming and going
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:39.080]   There's one way to stay in the know about what's going on in your living room
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.240]   Lighthouse we have a lighthouse at home and I just love it
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:49.480]   It understands that life is more than just a bunch of emotional alerts easy to set up you pair it to your Wi-Fi
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.800]   you put it in a good place
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.560]   and then
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:58.840]   A couple of things happen first of all you can invite others to be in your circle of friends
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.360]   You can have other owners, but also invite people who are you know going to be seen by the lighthouse
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.120]   And you can also set it up that the lighthouse doesn't record when you're home
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.760]   Which lisa has asked me to do so it's great for privacy, but when we're not home
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.240]   Those lighthouse sensors the 3d sensors sees your home and full 3d
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   It can distinguish between people and pets and other kinds of movement it uses facial recognition
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.080]   So when it sees somebody it doesn't know it pings you on your smartphone
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.000]   It lets you know and you can immediately turn on the camera and see what's going on
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.360]   Live streams and 1080p HD has automatic night vision plus two-way talk and a security siren
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.040]   You can automatically have the camera turn off when you're home. I like that feature
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:46.520]   You can turn the camera on and off whenever you're in want so you're in complete control of it
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.560]   of course bank level encryption for your video data and
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.240]   Because it keeps a 30-day library of everything it's seen
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:44:00.200]   You can ask it simple natural queries like what happened when I was gone. It literally understands
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.360]   I'm not there. This is what happened when I was gone
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.440]   And it only shows me the important stuff
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:09.080]   You could say complicated things like show me when the kids and the pets get home
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.880]   Or show me if there were any pets at all
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:16.520]   What did the kids do when I was out yesterday? What did the pets do when I was out yesterday?
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.640]   Tell me if you don't see the kids by 5 p.m. On weekdays
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:24.440]   You also can the kids can wave at the camera it recognizes waving and will ping you and say
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.520]   Hey, Michael wants to talk and I can turn on the camera and have a conversation with him
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.320]   That is awesome, especially for younger kids that don't have smartphones who just want to say hi
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.640]   When it comes to security lighthouse uses its artificial intelligence to tell you
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.560]   Only when it detects actual movement from people or sometimes large objects like doors when you're away from home
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.560]   And you want to see those doors open and close right?
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.560]   No more false alerts just because it sees a shadow or pets or
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.880]   Like that other dumb camera that was supposed to be smart that I bought that thought of my
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:59.240]   For days I was getting alerts it because there was a my alarm balloon. It thought was a person in the house
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:06.120]   I love lighthouse. I set it up use it every day. I always know what's going on in my house
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.480]   I want you to get a lighthouse. You can go to light dot house
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.840]   Light dot house to learn more
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.720]   Don't forget if you want to buy when I use the promo code to it you'll get 15 percent off a lighthouse camera
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:23.240]   And because it's still early days early customers get 90 days of AI service at no cost
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.200]   I love our lighthouse. We have two
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:32.440]   I and we have one here in the studio, which is normally plugged in but I unplugged it so I could show it to you light
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.000]   Dot house by the way, this is awesome
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.160]   It tilts and rotates so it makes it very easy to point it exactly what you want to see and what you don't want to see
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.000]   Light dot house 15 percent off when you use a promo code

[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.520]   You should have got a lighthouse
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.640]   So I did light dot house and we thank them so much for their support of this week and google

[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:19.640]   That's the least of things i've called leo
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.800]   That's light
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.520]   Cool so you're going to south by south west. I imagine uh, well, I mean you're you're kind of there
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:32.360]   Is it kind of like not a big deal because it's so normal
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:37.400]   It is it is actually such a big deal that I am not I'm not doing most of it this year
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.800]   Leo is the only the the leo event that is happening. I shouldn't the twit event
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.360]   Is it twit twig all of us?
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.960]   I think it's twit. Yeah
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.960]   The twit event is happening
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:54.520]   Friday morning at the capital one center at antones. We're doing a panel on iot security or just security
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.600]   and

[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.000]   Antones

[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.040]   He is not buying dinner nor he's he said it was an open bar, but it's not really an open bar either
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.120]   He's not buying you dinner nor is he buying you drinks. I mean the bar is open for business
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:39.640]   The bar is open. Yeah, there's and if you're not from texas you might be pleasantly surprised because the alcohol is relatively cheaper. Nice
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:45.800]   Uh cool. Well, I wish I could go it's been a year since i've been south by south west. Uh, maybe next year
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.240]   Maybe next year. We'll see
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.720]   Okay, so we got some google news here
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:59.080]   Uh, let's start off with zagat is zagat or zagat? I never really know zagat like bob sagat or
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.720]   I always say zagat zagat
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.160]   Uh, well doesn't matter anymore doesn't matter anymore google
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:11.240]   You may remember bot zagat back in 2011 for 151 million dollars
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:18.280]   Now google selling zagat to the infatuation, which is apparently a restaurant review company
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.200]   I've never really heard of the infatuation, but there you go apparently they're doing really well
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.600]   They turned profit last year. They've been around for a number of years
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:30.680]   Uh zagat reviews if you may have noticed over you know the the last few years
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.800]   Very de-emphasized on on google's part
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:39.720]   Google you know while it was owning it really just kind of tended to opt for its own recommendations engine
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:43.480]   And I feel like prior to the the buyout
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:48.280]   Zagat was a I mean it was very much a household name at least at least I was
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:55.400]   Very aware of zagat and then promptly stopped hearing anything about it supposedly google did a redesign back in 2016
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:00.360]   But you know, uh, they weren't giving it the uh, the treatment that it deserves
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.440]   So now it's going to the infatuation
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.760]   Uh and sounds like they're amped to have it as part of their network
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.840]   so
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.320]   Anyone any either of you guys will I guess
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.080]   Any thoughts Jeff Jeff's no yeah, just no longer
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.920]   It was good while it lasted jeff, uh, but I don't know stacy
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:23.000]   Were you much of a zagat user? What did you think of the integration?
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   I feel like way back in the early dark ages before the internet was on your phone. I had a zagat book
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:33.800]   That was about it. Yeah, um, but once I had a phone. I think I well I started
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.480]   I switched to Yelp and then I got cranky at Yelp. So I switched to
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:43.880]   Just google reviews that they had and I imagine google is just like hey, dude. We could crowd sources. Let's uh
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.360]   Let's get rid of this zagat stuff because which is I mean it
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.760]   Zagat was crowdsource stuff before it was even cool so sure
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:57.480]   It was yeah, it was a crowdsource social network in print basically
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.720]   Where they chose the the clips that you saw it was a super useful tool at the time
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:08.360]   But you're right. You know now that you mention it. I mean we have really great reviews engines now
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:13.720]   like there are a like there are very trusted easy to use immediate places to
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:19.160]   be able to kind of check the tenor and the the reputation of
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:26.600]   Restaurants and all sorts of other businesses super quickly google obviously has its reviews and yelp and whatnot
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.720]   So a brand like zagat maybe was you know a brand that's kind of locked in time
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:37.880]   It was uh much more much more useful when it was a print option and there weren't a whole lot more to compare to it
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:41.800]   Now times have kind of changed it's locked in paper
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.040]   but
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.600]   I I will say so there is a piece of news that I am excited about what's up and it's very small
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:54.920]   But they're now going to let you leave messages video messages when you call people and duo because I am one of like the 12 people who call people
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.200]   a duo
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   So the other one people are very happy
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.400]   The other 11 people are all related to me and I forced them to do it
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.400]   Uh to download the app
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:08.440]   So I was excited that I could because no one ever actually picks up because no one uses it on a regular basis
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.240]   So they're like my phone's making a weird noise. I wonder what's happening right?
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.840]   And why is that person staring at me that meanwhile knock knock feature
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.520]   And then you know so now I can at least be like hey
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.480]   I called but I can't imagine more
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:27.960]   Does anyone else out there anyone feeler if uh if if my wife is traveling or if I'm traveling and we
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.640]   You know say hey, we should hop on on video chat to do this
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:36.200]   I've gotten in the habit of calling her on hangouts. I find it to be more. Sorry. Not hangouts duo
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.400]   I find it to be more resilient like network resilient
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:45.480]   It tends to do a better job there. Uh, and it's just like I know she's got a pixel last generation pixel
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:50.600]   I've got a pixel device. I know the apps installed on there outside of that never use it
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.600]   I mean, I have no one else to use it with
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.760]   My my husband's like this is stupid. Just call me on hangouts. I'm like, oh
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:05.640]   But why so what why uh why opt for hangouts from his perspective just because he's used to that or I think it's because he's on an iphone
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:09.880]   And so he's had hangouts on the iphone for a while and yeah downloading duo. I mean I
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.920]   I made my bff and my parents
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.440]   Download it and my mom. She is that person who's just like
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.080]   What's happening? Huh?
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:20.680]   I
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:26.600]   Stacey. Stacey. Are you on the phone? Yeah, are you you're staring at me, but I just hear a ringtone. You're staring
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.840]   Why are you looking at me and waving at me?
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:34.760]   But yeah, I think I think the call when I when I make it through to someone I'm very excited so I I just
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.160]   So yes, I would I'm glad they're still developing on it. I would like to see
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.360]   Other people like it. I don't know. Yeah
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:49.000]   Yeah, see it be more of an integral part of android as a whole and pre-installed that we just we don't get those things
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.200]   when it comes to
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.960]   Messaging or video messaging or whatever it's always kind of broken and convoluted
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.840]   Apparently the the messages that you leave are
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:03.080]   Going to disappear automatically after a day. So they are ephemeral. That's a problem
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:10.360]   So it's there so if I'm on my death bed, I'm not going to use that. I'm going to use something different. Yeah, you want to yes
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.800]   Yeah, don't give your final message to the world on snap
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.480]   No snap might not be around
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:24.680]   Much longer so oh, I do very hot. That's all right. I don't use it anyway, so whatever
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:33.400]   Uh, let's see here. What else did I find in here? Um, goo. Okay, so what's up? I was gonna say google fiber, but you go
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.440]   Oh, yeah. No, no, that's that's that's an interesting one. So this was things to speak about things that made it last
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.040]   Yeah, right
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:45.080]   So on uh on motherboard there's a post about kind of checking in with a progress of google fiber
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.640]   eight years ago we started to hear about fiber for the first time
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:56.120]   And you know big ambitions when fiber when google fiber was rolling out to be a disruptor
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:03.560]   Uh to the broad band industry offer really fast gigabit speeds in the us low price 70 bucks a month
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.880]   And uh, you know isp's of course kind of jumped on
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:13.080]   On you know into these areas and lowered their prices so it did disrupt to a certain degree
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.960]   It kind of changed what isp's were doing in these areas
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.120]   Um, but ultimately as the article points out the adoption was low
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:25.480]   Obviously laying fiber is time consuming. It's it's costly very costly
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.960]   Google had recently back in 2016 kind of shifted
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.800]   their um
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:36.920]   Their approach to next generation wireless technologies. It kind of put everything on pause
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.000]   They you know had a couple of different
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:44.760]   Different people at the head of a fiber filter through there some layoffs all that kind of stuff
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:50.760]   Uh, but now I mean there's just it's at a standstill fibers really not doing a whole lot right now
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.520]   Uh, we're not hearing much about it and google's just basically saying, huh? Well
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:58.600]   When there's uh, when there's something to change we'll let you know we'll unpause
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.320]   Where we're at right now. Um
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:08.600]   Did fiber disrupt enough or do you think that there's still fuel for for the fiber machine going forward? What do you think?
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:16.280]   There's two there's actually three things that fiber I think did and I sat I sat in the audience when it was announced
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.440]   I sat at kc when they started
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:26.280]   Um, and I hoped desperately for it here in Austin and didn't get it. Yeah, but so I've been following this whole saga
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:28.680]   they
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:34.760]   Changed the price for broadband in the markets where they intro'd they also helped bring gigabit
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:43.240]   internet to more places by getting communities to stand up and say we want that and getting consumers excited about gigabit
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:49.640]   Even if even today most people are like, I don't need a gigabit service. That's ridiculous. Um,
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:56.280]   It also changed the pricing for free stuff. So comcast actually has a free broadband
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:00.440]   For kids in school that are on the free and reduced lunch plan
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.920]   And originally that was I think it was about five megabits per second, but
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.040]   Or was it may have been even less in google?
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:13.160]   They had a free service that was either five or ten megabits per second and
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.480]   So comcast boosted their offering to match googles
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:21.160]   So in that sense if you got a free lunch in a Comcast area
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:25.800]   And applied for this program you got better broadband. So that's it's small, but it matters
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:30.840]   and then the third thing is they brought they highlighted the issue of
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:39.880]   For the FCC and has changed some rules about making it easier to get pull attachments, which is so esoteric and nobody wants to think about it
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.440]   But it's essential for getting
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:48.760]   Any sort of infrastructure broadband infrastructure out to cities. So in Austin, for example, AT&T owned
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:55.080]   two thirds of the polls and google was like, we want access and AT&T is like, I don't think so
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.680]   And there was some legal things and
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:05.160]   That was actually one of the reasons why they kind of stopped deployment, I think, is they were like, god, this is really hard
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.160]   Yeah, no kidding, right and you think of google and it's and it's
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.800]   seemingly infinitely
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.920]   Deep pockets for stuff like this and also their their spending pattern their their funding pattern
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:19.320]   for back when fiber was
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:23.240]   Just getting started and even a few years into it where google
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:27.320]   you know, only very recently did google kind of changed course and and
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:34.600]   Changed its way of thinking around how it was spending its money and how it was funding all these crazy things that we know are just
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.760]   insanely expensive
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:41.720]   It's very recently well, they also tightened the tight in the strings a little bit on that and uh, you know
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:47.160]   So something like this especially fiber fiber is very known to be incredibly expensive and even
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.240]   Well google did a lot of things to reduce
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:55.960]   They did a lot of things to reduce the costs so it's it's not enough to they actually had some very big innovations
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:58.680]   One, they were making their own networking equipment two
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:03.800]   The way they went about picking cities helped market this stuff and then three
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:09.160]   They had they had done some work with new drilling innovations
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.160]   That would make it easier in some places. So
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:20.520]   There were in technological innovations and google kind of style innovations to make it cheaper
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.960]   But it still wasn't cheap enough and they still had to deal with people
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.560]   in google as an engineering focus something terrible
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.560]   like customer
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:36.920]   They hate customers they contracted out some of their fiber digs and those guys are used to working for atm t and it just
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.720]   I
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:43.720]   I don't think they maybe realized the scope of the problem and then also people
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:52.360]   People didn't sign up google's in love. I mean this is probably like the duo problem all over again or any other good google product that people are like
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:55.320]   I don't understand how to use it. They were like, why do I need a gig?
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:59:01.960]   I don't need a gig. That's ridiculous. AT&T has got me locked into a contract. I'll just go with them. They have a gig now too. Hey
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.840]   Right. Stacy. What about the argument?
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:10.200]   Especially from you do you buy that wireless is going to be as good as
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:14.520]   Fiber for those customers who say I don't need a gig
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.400]   So fixed wireless
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:24.520]   Will be good in some places as long as we can there's a couple of places and things that might disrupt it
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.440]   So I talked to the arrow guys a while back and they're the guys doing
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:32.760]   I think it's a 34. I used to have it on my
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.640]   My board what what a frequency
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.760]   But they're using millimeter wave
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:45.480]   It's the same sort of 5g basically for mobile or sorry for fixed wireless. They said that
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:51.080]   Because the spectrum attenuates in weather and with trees so it gets disrupted
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:55.800]   Snow is actually a bigger problem than rain for them
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.960]   So I think it's going to be kind of like satellite television maybe
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.600]   Oh, right
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.640]   So, I mean it's a very similar kind of idea except your satellite dish will be paid
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.560]   It'll be pointing to someplace. That's actually not in space. It'll be
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.040]   Trade that yeah weather
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.920]   And then your and carsten the company are so smooth that I went off the air a little while ago
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:25.160]   Because the power went out here and the generator I have a generator sit went on and everything went off
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.200]   And yes, no can cause real havoc on anything. It's above the ground. Wow
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:36.440]   Whereas the fiber is nice nice and safe below the ground. Yep. Yep. Well, I mean there are fiber cuts all the time
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.640]   So that's that's not that's humanly easy
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.480]   Well, yeah, but I mean like we're not getting over that anytime soon
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.480]   I
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:53.400]   I'm wondering it's probably a tenuous connection here, but I'm wondering if there's any possible
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.480]   connection
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.360]   to
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:59.800]   You know the need of drilling to make this fiber happen
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:04.840]   Google's probably moving on from the whole idea of drilling for fiber anyways at this point
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.160]   But there's an article that was put in here. Maybe jeff
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:12.200]   I'm not sure if you put this in here or if you did stacy about google researching hypersonics
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.720]   I did I was fascinated by that for drilling
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.680]   And in this article it points out
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.960]   It's like a geothermal energy and tunneling but I'm like oh this I don't know maybe
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.520]   First it seemed like an april fool story
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:33.400]   So hypersonic technology hypersonics is basically five or more times the speed of sound
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.200]   Usually that refers to aircraft or weapons in this case. It's focused on
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.000]   climate and energy systems
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.480]   Thanks to a company called hyper sciences
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.680]   That's developing this drilling system google might actually buy the company according to this article
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:54.040]   but it basically it fires concrete projectiles at two
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.600]   Two or more kilometers per second ahead of that again say that again. Yes, say that again
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.120]   Stop and say that again fires concrete
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:08.440]   Projectiles at two or more kilometers per second ahead of the drill bit
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.160]   and so drills
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.080]   Deep wells 10 times faster than what you have with existing systems
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:21.080]   And isn't this useful for the borian company too? Yeah, isn't this useful for boring hyperloop across the country
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:28.040]   Well, how big are the what are the limitations on projectiles? Well, I presume you can just do a bunch of these
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.680]   stack them up
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.640]   Right
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:37.640]   That's a big assumption when you're dealing with under the ground rocks and different striations and all right
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.760]   That's fair. Oh, you kill joy stacy
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.200]   Sorry, my mom is a geothermal physicist. We talked about I was getting hyperloop
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.160]   I want you to send this to her
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.000]   This I will send it to her
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   But you know what it is actually kind of neat
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.240]   Think about when they talk about like geothermal google's very aggressive in how they power their data centers and they need more
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.280]   A data center would be great powered by if you could find a geothermal spot and have it just
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:07.800]   Power up next to the data center. That's awesome because you'd have continual power that's
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.520]   Renewable you do two things you put it in the Arctic
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.760]   So you cool the computers and you geothermal the energy
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.680]   And you geothermal I don't think that's just geothermal it
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.840]   You just geothermal it
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.680]   Makes sense to me about
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.160]   They're doing
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:32.680]   quantum computers because then those have to be super cold and you would just do that in the Arctic and
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.280]   It may not even be cold enough actually claims
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:42.440]   It's five times cheaper than today's tunnel boring machines able to dig tunnels at two and a half times faster. Wow
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.880]   So hit google head to head against elon musk's
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.520]   boring company so no
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:53.800]   So so if it can if it can do that with tunnels, just think what it could do for fiber
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.840]   There you go for drilling for fiber, huh? Yeah, more. I mean even think about like that
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.840]   Fibers only only the below the sod. Yeah
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.840]   What if you could do it though for the undersea cables which currently
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.240]   Just truck along at the bottom of the ocean and some of them are buried some of them aren't
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:16.360]   Actually, they're they're buried but not very deeply. What if you could bury them more deeply than you wouldn't have a
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:23.000]   Which which with the fear of what the rust keys are going to do with undersea cables? That's that's an important not our security, right?
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.400]   They're out exposed
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:31.400]   Bad things can happen to them. Mm. No more shark attacks. I love that story about sharks being attracted to undersea cables
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:37.480]   and cutting off whole whole regions to the internet
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:43.880]   Shoots sure sonic concrete blame the sharks. Why don't you? Oh good
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:49.400]   Sharks are always that is a cool. So i'm glad you put that on here. Yeah, it's cool
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.840]   And apparently there's gonna be more information to share at south by south west so
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:58.360]   Really? So apparently we will hear more about that. That's what I read. Maybe I misread that
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:04.040]   I'm envisioning an IO will all be in tunnels that have been bored by the hypersonic tunneling. That's what I want
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:09.480]   The new IO will be completely underground by the way by the way by the way, yeah, you know because you know
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:16.040]   You know when the show I had my bridge phobia, right? Yeah, so I always figure but I don't have a problem
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.440]   Go on the Lincoln tunnel because it's bored into the stone, right? So it's okay
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.800]   So so even if it had a little problem in the concrete, it's not gonna leak. I'm not gonna have a problem
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.560]   It's okay, right? I didn't know the bart
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.720]   is
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.920]   above
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:37.400]   The rock in the water in a tube that gets dropped into the water. Did you know that? I didn't know that now
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.720]   Yeah
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:46.280]   So that scares me. Of course. I say it should be bored into the stone, but in earthquake territory. Yeah, that would be a problem probably don't
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.800]   That's interesting. I don't yeah
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.760]   And
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.800]   And
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.480]   New York is unique because it's bedrock is actually good rock
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:00.360]   It's I think isn't it granite or a schist or something really stable as opposed to like something
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.680]   The best rock whatever it is Stacey. It's the best
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:06.440]   It's enough because we are the center of the university nothing but the universe for New York
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.960]   I feel like there's this whole story about it
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.680]   I can't believe I read a whole story about the bedrock of New York
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.840]   But I believe you guys have really good rock
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:19.880]   For supporting tall buildings and digging stuff through without it crumbling
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.600]   Yeah, we don't we're in limestone country
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:27.960]   That was that was a quite a quite a detour. I apologize, but I just know there was a tenuous
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.520]   Jason allowed
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:35.320]   It works it worked. I will allow for it
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.640]   How else can we detour here the u.s. Department of Defense
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.040]   This has a little bit
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:47.320]   Some people kind of a little curious a little worried I'd say employs a google anyway
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.840]   Some of them u.s. Department of Defense is partnering with google to create
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.680]   Artificial intelligence that can analyze drone footage
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:07:03.160]   So apparently project maven which is with the u.s. Department of Defense all about identifying objects in drone footage some employees at google
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.760]   were
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.760]   outraged to discover this
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:12.360]   That this is not a Boston dynamics because of justice the Boston dynamics were used for defense contractors. Yeah
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.640]   and and you know unmanned warfare
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:21.320]   And yeah, I don't see this playing well with google employees. Yeah. Yeah
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   the you know the the fact that google's offering assistance to the military for
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.000]   Something you know something along the lines of surveillance
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.960]   Also, there's the ethical considerations around the use of machine learning systems for this sort of thing
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.160]   Google says that it's working quote to develop policies and safeguards
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.640]   Around the use of machine learning for military applications and then another google spokesman
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:48.760]   Stress that this is a research project. Don't worry. It's just a research project
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:55.400]   With no plans to implement it. There are no plans to implement these results into AI controlled military hardware. Don't worry
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:00.600]   See I think I think that the these technology companies need to operate more like hospitals
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.200]   What do you call those kind of committees you have in hospitals before you do something that might be new?
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.760]   IBR's there's
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.440]   Yeah, what's that stand for?
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.600]   IRB's IRB's internal review board
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.720]   Yeah internal review board. So, you know, you have cases like like something in facebook somebody
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.120]   Facebook to something released to put us on the rundown
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.680]   asking people whether they think that
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:26.200]   It's okay for pedophiles to look at photos of underage naked children. Why would you ask that?
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:33.240]   Who in the place would ask that right? I mean, it's obviously stupid. It's obviously wrong. They they apologize for it immediately, but but
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:39.000]   How something can I oh, it's just an experiment. It's just a test is too much the
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.160]   the um
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.160]   justification for too much
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:48.200]   Stupid stupidity in technology companies. Mm-hmm. And so this kind of well
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.760]   It's just a research project that you know, it's just knowledge
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:55.000]   Not gonna cut it anymore when you control the world, man. Yeah, Stacy. What do you think?
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.640]   Uh, that was a lot of things to throw out all at the same time. So I'm like
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:07.480]   What about the drone thing Google helping drone military drones? Are you okay with that or?
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:14.440]   No, I I feel like Google usually picks technologies that benefit that have a benefit outside of
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:22.200]   They might do something like this if it had another benefit for like society or their information gathering
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.800]   And I guess it does from the sense of information gathering, but it does strike me as a project that
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.960]   It's got bad PR associated with it and also
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:40.440]   It it's kind of it lives up to everyone's fear about google which is they can see everything and they may one day use it for evil
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.600]   Yeah
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   so I mean because
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.680]   in boston dynamics, I think they probably didn't like that
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:54.520]   That visual as well of being associated with something that was clearly
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.400]   scary as all get out
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:04.520]   However, I'm like the sand flea is cute, but that's the only one that's cute only redeemable boston dynamics robot
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.920]   So they're scary and um fascinating all at the same time
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.320]   I'm an equal part scared and fascinated by boston dynamics robots
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.680]   And I think a lot of google projects can be used for surveillance and could have true
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.080]   they have the
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.720]   At least the veneer of they could also help humanity
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:31.560]   So I I think this is just a I get why people are outraged. I do get worried about exactly the sort of thing
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:38.360]   So or maybe the the safe guard that people you know tell themselves anyways, which is well
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.600]   it's one thing if google is is
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:46.360]   Doing the surveillance for their own means it's another thing if google is doing their surveillance
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:50.600]   For an arm of the government or for the defense, you know or whatever
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.960]   Yeah, that's true. The relationship takes it another step further
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.880]   Right the technology is going to be out there and published and is available and the government can can use it too
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:06.680]   That doesn't stop anything, but how complicit do you want to be right in these activities directly?
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.800]   Yeah
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.600]   and
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.720]   brightly, I think they say not complicit at all and I think it's good that tech companies are
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:21.000]   Asking themselves this because they are in a position a where everyone's like, oh, we hate you tech companies
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.840]   You're evil they've suddenly become evil. I know jeff. I'm just saying in the popular mind people are much more now
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.840]   We're like wait a second
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.920]   But well, yeah, and it's gonna get used against them because you have you have I'm sorry you
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.440]   Finish go ahead. No, and I was just saying so it's good that they're actually having these conversations
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.760]   now and I hope that
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:47.000]   They do and I think facebook with their survey. I'm like with that. I think was just
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.440]   I don't know how that even got out there. I really don't I'm like oh, it's just so
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:12:00.840]   Well, and and now you have uh not even because it's my friends on the left that the guardian are going all moral panic
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:07.240]   No panics, but now you have right wing filmmakers making a film about the evils of google and facebook good segue
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:12.840]   Both ends we were on the same page on this one jeff. I had it open. I had the notes open and everything
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.480]   Uh, yeah, well, and this is kind of what you guys are talking about right like big tech
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.000]   Uh, and what what is driving big tech?
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.640]   How is that like what what are the the grand effects of these decisions that these ginormous
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:33.240]   Mammoth technology companies are making but that how that's mixing with politics got peter
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:40.360]   Schweiser Schweiser Schweiser. I don't really know. Uh, but apparently a right wing journalist. He actually uh at
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.760]   One time was I think the script the uh speechwriter
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.600]   For speech writing consultant for president george w bush
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:56.040]   Anyways, he's producing a documentary aiming to show how these technology companies filter the news how they highlight their own agenda
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:02.200]   It's tentatively called the creepy line, which I think is a that is a perfect title, right?
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:05.320]   Like it is it is using nourish bits famous quote. Yes
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:11.240]   Uh, but it's a focus on censorship on oppression and digital media and big tech and big tech
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:19.000]   And apparently we'll be screened for the first time or at least expected to be screened this may at the can film festival
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.600]   Uh, he's he's also done previously a documentary with steve bannon
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.640]   Uh produced by steve bannon called clinton cash
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:34.520]   So that kind of gives you a sense of the direction that that you can probably expect out of this documentary
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:39.160]   So this is where the tech companies are they're going to get attacked from both sides now as big
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.120]   To use stacy's word evil empires
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.480]   um
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.600]   joking stacy
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.120]   uh
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.600]   and and uh and and that means that
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:53.240]   Like it or not or however virtuous they know they are
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.800]   They have to be very careful and and I want them to be innovative. I want them to be
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:04.920]   Smart but I want them to be careful about doing dumb things they're going to get used against them and the entirety of the internet
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.240]   Mm-hmm
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.680]   Yeah, I'm uh, I'm curious
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:16.280]   I'm equal parts curious and uh, I don't know what the other part of this is like
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:23.320]   Uh, I I know that this is going to be a fueled, you know, if fueled right wing sort of
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.280]   perspective uh, you know, trepidation based on based on who it's coming from
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:33.240]   Doesn't mean I don't want I'm not interested in watching it because they're even even though
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:39.160]   You know my own personal agenda, which I will keep entirely out of out of this show
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.880]   I'm still definitely feel
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.760]   Like the point that we're at with technology companies like i'm i'm worried about it
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.760]   Like i'm worried about the the ramifications of what we think we know
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.440]   But we actually don't and how that's how that's painting and shaping the world
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.960]   It's certainly been a reason that i've stepped away to a certain degree from from social media in the past year
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:05.480]   Um, and I know i'm not alone. I but I I just saw too straight. Don't please Jason. Don't do this
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:09.560]   Don't do this. I love social media for two months and I saw a different world
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:10.840]   No, I know
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.760]   Farhead miles you just did it and I tried to read that thing four times and I couldn't I couldn't do it
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.320]   No, it got me too pissed. Yeah, he's hit or miss man. Sometimes he's good. Sometimes you're like, what are you smoking?
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.760]   Off
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:25.800]   I can piss me off. I can understand though. I can understand the perspective right like when you're on
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:33.400]   social media when we have a habit around social media at least I have a habit around twitter that started back in 2007
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.880]   it's a daily habit and
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.200]   So so much of my much of my daily reality is shaped around
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:46.440]   The moments that I have when I open twitter and I see what's actually going on because I I do read that instead of reading
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:53.560]   A newspaper to use farhud's example and I don't know if it necessarily makes me a happier person to do that
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.240]   So when I say stepping away and being worried about technology like
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:04.600]   I mean not entirely but I certainly feel like my life is better when I'm not consumed by all this stuff and
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:10.600]   I don't think I think there are a lot of people that don't don't make that realization might not I don't know
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.680]   I guess they have to realize that for themselves
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:18.440]   My wife started watching more tennis so she'd watch less people lose. I get that. Yes. Yeah
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:22.200]   Yeah
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:26.440]   So anyways that will come in a layer. No, we have celebrities promoting
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.040]   Assistant
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.560]   Yeah during the Oscars you guys watch the Oscars. Did you care? I
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:38.680]   Watch the Oscar. I do watch the dresses though and on social media
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.040]   But I did want to see the commercial. Will you play the commercial? Yeah, we've got a few of them in there
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:47.720]   So we can pick one of them. I mean, it's you know, it's an article that kind of points to
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:53.720]   Uh a couple of them see I mean you can literally just pick one of them and just go ahead and play it
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.720]   But it's basically celebrities realizing
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.600]   Uh that google might just be smarter than them for doing some of these things
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.840]   over over
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.480]   Are nope backspace backspace
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:11.240]   Over feels like we started searching two hours ago
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:16.360]   Feels like we never gonna find this show
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.400]   Now
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.360]   So what you see for those of you who don't know
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:30.440]   Yeah, so it's uh, christie
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:37.560]   Uh, tegan john lennet legend doing I mean we've all been there right trying to enter in something on a remote
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:44.200]   Uh on the on-screen keyboard and it's the most painful experience in the entire world. Well, maybe not the most actually
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.280]   It's not the most i've had a pretty bad that's that's pretty bad
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:52.200]   But I will say I
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.280]   We have an older chromecast, but we don't have the new one which works with the google home
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.720]   And I really have thought oh it might be worth 70 bucks just to be like
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:09.960]   Yeah, show me this. Oh, sorry. Sorry everyone my phone did it too. My phone did it too. I'm sorry. I did not
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.720]   Who knows how how well that translated?
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.000]   um
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   But yeah, so which actually so
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.280]   I think what i've realized over the last couple of years is that google
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:28.760]   Google has a smart marketing team like I like sometimes you watch these these marketing campaigns and it's just like i roll super cheesy
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:35.880]   Whatever. I don't get that as often with google as I do with others yet. I don't know how effective they are at actually selling
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.720]   Their stuff. I don't know if you guys talked about this a couple of weeks ago
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.400]   But uh, there were stats on how google's
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:48.520]   sales of the pixel devices had been in 2017 idsc
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:52.360]   uh, basically said that 3.9 million units shipped
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:58.200]   in uh 2017 of both last generation pixel and this generation pixel
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.320]   And you compare that to you know the behemoth
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:06.920]   Obviously, but apple selling 77.3 million iPhones in the fourth quarter alone
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.000]   So 3.9 million total
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   77.3 million in a quarter
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.880]   And it just kind of it just screams at you that like google has all this money they have marketing prowess
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.920]   I like their their marketing campaigns and their ad campaigns
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.680]   But it just doesn't seem to do much. So I wonder how
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:31.560]   How an ad campaign around assistant is really gonna move the needle for for google? Yeah, I don't know either
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:36.760]   But I think it's you know, it's the same problem we had with uh, what which mccoll what's the what's the photo thing we talked about earlier?
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.840]   Uh lens
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:44.040]   lens. Yeah, it's also reminding you it exists. Yeah, that's true. You can use this you can use it on your phone
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.640]   Or if you are using it confirmation that you're doing something right
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.680]   Yes, john legend does it you're on the ti you're on the right team. You're on the john legend
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:55.320]   Chrissy tigan team stay where you start this isn't
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:01.080]   No, I was I was gonna say it's kind of like and i'm very curious because everybody has been a buzz about the
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.560]   the spiky directed
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.680]   apple home pod commercial, which is pretty but i'm just like
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:11.560]   Why are we so excited about this thing for a product that quite honestly
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.760]   Is not awesome
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.360]   like
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.680]   Nobody's know it none of the reviews out there
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:22.600]   seem really excited and yeah, I mean
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.560]   There's a whole lot of asterisks
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:32.920]   Involved in reviews. It's great if you live on a remote island and only like to communicate with penguins
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.640]   Yeah, yeah, but the ad is cool
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.360]   Audio listeners just kind of to trust us
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.240]   It's fk twigs
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.240]   Harry woman comes home from work
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   New York apartment with many locks
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.880]   We'll find her best friend the home pod, right? Hey, sir. I need something I'd like
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.160]   Okay
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:01.640]   She's really not happy
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.720]   No
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:13.320]   I think she's relaxing. I think it brings helping too. Yeah. Yeah. This is me after twig
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.120]   Like
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.640]   Maybe the gym
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.640]   I'm done
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.840]   There we go now it's coming around
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:28.600]   Now do you have or have you tested the home pod whoa
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:34.360]   Kevin has tested the home pod I sent it to him because he's an actual apple music person
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:38.680]   And I don't have any I couldn't actually play anything on it
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.960]   so
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.240]   He was the logical tester. That's one of those asterisks. Yeah. Yeah
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:50.760]   Right. I mean it's very limited on support of how long devices can use it. Yeah, this is
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:55.560]   It is it is a long but kind of fun cool. Yeah
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.000]   Yeah, it's funky looking. I like the uh
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.680]   Like the visual aspects of her mind. She's now expanding her apartment and redecorating
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:07.800]   She forgot that she had a horrible day at work at this point
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:12.120]   When you could redecorate your apartment. No kidding
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.080]   I'm like
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.480]   Where's the sad even playing it?
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.800]   It's a long one
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.520]   I don't know. I see it. I see a deer in my backyard trying to
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.160]   Almost not even we get through the snow. It's so deep
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:28.520]   Geez
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:33.000]   So so there's an ad that's not that's an apple ad where they're like
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.480]   Yeah, this will change your freaking life
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:40.600]   As opposed to like here. We're going to show you how to use our product. Yeah, right, right
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.280]   um
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.280]   I actually saw an
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.480]   Article right before coming here. It's not the bottom of the dock
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.480]   Uh josh
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:54.360]   Almost 20 apparently almost 20 of the us has a home
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:23:00.920]   Smart speaker at this point at least according. That is amazing. I thought so
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.520]   Um, that include like sonos and other other brands or that
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.880]   Speakers, let's see here. This is per rain
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.840]   Rain and pulse string
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.960]   Uh teamed up with voice bots three names i've never heard of maybe you guys have
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.600]   Uh, but they interviewed
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.240]   1,057 adults across the us
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:26.680]   And based on how they you know conducted that study so I guess that's the important part that I don't I can't read here
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:33.960]   But they found 19.7 percent of the people they spoke to say that they own a smart speaker so I imagine it would I mean
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.720]   You know, it doesn't seem like it's isolated to just
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.360]   Google homes or the or this
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.240]   Home pod or whatever but
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.720]   Oh guys. I screwed up. I said spike lee. I meant spike jones the dude who did her
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.800]   Oh, okay. Okay. All right. That makes more sense
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   My brain just I was like wow. This is like spike lee as way. I love his work, but this is heavy
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.880]   What I can see from him
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.920]   Yeah, sorry. Sorry. My brain was thinking about spike jones
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   But my brain announced that that makes more sense that it's more music music video driven
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.800]   Yes, but yeah, 20 percent so
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:18.520]   Which i'm curious to kind of ask you about stacey like 20 percent of the us population does this mean that we are
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.160]   officially like in the
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.600]   smart home
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.920]   Renaissance or I mean what is it?
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:29.880]   Um, sure so I I buy the numbers
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.240]   I do think that there's a ton of people who have these um
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:39.560]   I think what this means is we've hit the limits of our current user interfaces
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:45.400]   Yeah for actually controlling devices and we've all realized that and so the next step this is going to be like
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.720]   you know, like
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:55.160]   I think of gaming with like joysticks how you you how we started out with like the the actual joystick and then we got more sophisticated
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:59.320]   What's going to happen is we get more sophisticated user interactions like
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.960]   Voice is awesome for some things
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:09.160]   It is terrible for others and you can already see this like amazon and google are both trying to cram things like routines into this
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.240]   because
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.480]   it's still too hard to like
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.280]   You can control something but like
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.480]   Every single individual device in my house and I have like almost a hundred at least maybe more
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.080]   Has it has to have its own unique individual date?
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:28.360]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, like have you ever sounded
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:32.360]   Well, I mean like every light bulb so
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:36.200]   Why is this funny?
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:41.480]   It's so funny. I know it's just I thought you know, well people who are really into this might have
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.200]   eight ten things in their home
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:45.880]   I have at least 35
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.520]   I have at least 35. No, I have 40 now Wi-Fi connected devices
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:58.280]   And so that doesn't include, you know, 20 light switches probably 30 smart bulbs that doesn't include any of the sensors
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.360]   Right, right. I think if you are the queen of things
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.360]   I think if you really add it up though
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:11.080]   I think most people would be surprised how many devices that are in their home that are actually connected via Wi-Fi and you just don't think about it
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:16.520]   You know, like our our our honey well famous stat that we set up the first day we you know
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:22.280]   We upgraded our heating system and then never thought about before it's connected to our Wi-Fi
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:27.000]   It has been we just never use it to control anything, but it's another iot device in our home
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:33.000]   Yeah, and any connect any appliance that you buy starting this year and next year
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.760]   We'll have connectivity built into it whether or not you turn it on it's up to you, but yeah, it's gonna have it
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.440]   so
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.480]   I mean Comcast last year said that in its homes
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.600]   They had an average of 11 devices
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.480]   11 Wi-Fi connected devices
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:57.320]   And again think about it a family of four you're gonna have your computers your phones probably a kindle a tablet maybe and then
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:02.040]   Basic stuff like a printer. I mean people still have printers. I think I don't know
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:09.800]   Um, so start from there and then add your TVs and you're not even into weird stacy like stuff yet
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:16.440]   Right and depending on the size of your household. I mean just everybody has a phone that right there is for five people depending
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:23.000]   Um, you know and your laptop six seven eight. I mean just in general you probably had 10 devices easy
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.240]   Well, you know what I want you know what I want for my birthday, which isn't from six months
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.480]   Well, you know what for my number next week stacy is an inventory of your things
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.560]   I can actually I don't actually know if I could give that to you
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:41.560]   That's actually one of the scarier aspects of this you don't even know what things are buried into your life
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.600]   Well, yeah, because I can only see the Wi-Fi stuff
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.920]   But I have like I said like the zigby light bulbs
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:51.960]   So then I have to go into each individual app because I personally have like four different types of light bulbs
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:57.880]   But then also my my like motion sensors. How many of those are there? I don't know. Yeah, so
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:02.040]   Wow, okay. So you've got a home full of things
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:09.080]   Um yet we have it is like it is thing castle. Yes, it's the thing. Yes, the thing castle
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:13.480]   Um, no kidding and then you have companies like amazon
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:15.960]   Who are deciding they're not going to sell?
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.960]   Certain things anymore for instance the nest
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.200]   Products newer nest products are not going to be sold by amazon
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:30.840]   Amazon's current inventory of nest products. They're going to drop those off as they sell out
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:34.280]   And I think nest has said well, we don't want our stuff in your store anyways
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.960]   Uh
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.760]   And I don't know it just kind of has me wondering like
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.600]   We're at a point where people have you are
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:49.080]   Buying these smart home devices, which gives them the capability the access for
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.840]   You know the sea of devices to connect to it
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:59.160]   But it feels also in in some ways like they're the smart home war is kind of heating up right now to the point where it's like
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:05.640]   Well, maybe we need to buckle down and our products only support our devices and not yours
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:14.200]   Google in amazon in this case are behaving exactly like the carriers used to behave when they started blocking and throttling things like skype or
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.520]   What's that and things that kind of and this is this is not a good look for them?
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:22.680]   No, this is really against this is bad for consumers
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:28.440]   Kevin and I talked about this a lot on the show because obviously that's a big part of what the show is about but
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:34.760]   I am so frustrated with them and I am so frustrated like
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:40.040]   This appears to be part of an escalation of the hey, you can't play
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:44.280]   You know youtube on amazon fire tv or
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.720]   Amazon echo shows which sucked right and now they're saying that
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:53.400]   That gives moto. I think had a story that talked about a conference call
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:58.840]   And so this is coming basically the google guys think it's coming directly from bayzos saying fine
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:07.000]   You don't let us play youtube. We won't sell your gear. So what's the next step my amazon echo suddenly stops controlling my nest thermostat
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.880]   Because boys can i do mean boys
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.760]   Yeah
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:18.840]   This is this is the sort of thing that well, not only do you hurt your customers you hurt the whole space right?
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.680]   No one's
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:26.600]   No one's gonna buy this stuff and then eventually some senator is gonna be like wait. What oh, this is not cool at all
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:32.120]   Yeah, sorry, I I really felt like
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.800]   um, there's been a lot of cooperation like for a little while it's it's felt like
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:45.400]   In the beginning there were all these different standards for iot to connect to but then you had these home assistants that really end up being this
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:50.520]   Unifying force to be like, oh, we don't really care what you have is it will control it all
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:56.520]   Uh, and then now it seems to be veering away from each other and I I fear that because like you said it
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:01.000]   How is that good for the industry as a whole as consumers?
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.240]   I don't want to have to look and see oh, well this device only supports
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:11.000]   These iot devices and this one supports those so i've got to choose my side and I guess I like those things
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:18.680]   So I got to go this way like consumers don't want that they need simple and I feel like possibly that might be moving further away from that
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:24.200]   And this is why I want standards not ecosystems everyone's like oh ecosystems and i'm like
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.320]   Take your ecosystem because ecosystems are
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:32.120]   They're fluctuating you can like mad at somebody but with the standards
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:38.200]   You're just like this has got to work with this right all the time and by god, it would not mess with
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:43.960]   Innovation I hate that excuse there there are standards that can mess with innovation, but the basic stuff
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:47.480]   She inner connectivity
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:52.120]   Yeah, it's actually interoperability. It's not just inner connectivity and that's what makes this so hard
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:55.560]   We we and I don't know
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.800]   Would you feel better?
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:02.120]   Would you feel better if your echo laughed at you? I was gonna say let's talk about evil echoes
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.600]   Yeah
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:09.880]   Yeah, this is i'm so glad that amazon finally admitted this by the way because like i've been looking at all these stories and i'm like
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.040]   Oh my god
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:17.400]   Is this real? This is awesome apparently apparently echoes are randomly laughing at people
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.040]   Uh, they're all gonna laugh at you
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.120]   Uh
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:26.280]   Yeah, we played the laugh on our show. It is not it is not something you want to hear
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.600]   More of a cackle it is more of a new cackle
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:31.560]   Uh
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:34.920]   Yeah, it's the second link that i have there is a is a tweet
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:39.320]   Josh if you if you go to the doc, there's a there's a twitter
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:43.000]   Link there that'll play for you the cackle on a jbl
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.240]   Echo device
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:49.080]   Yeah, let's see here if we can hear this here. We here it goes
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:54.280]   Wow it hearties
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:58.040]   I mean other than that it's on repeat and now it sounds fake
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:00.280]   It hardly sounded like it was coming from a device
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.960]   It just kind of sounded like someone in the background
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.960]   Well as they were recording the video
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:08.040]   Yeah, so there's so much i so many questions i have about this i'm like
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:13.800]   Are they all using the same skill because like you could have a skill in the echo and maybe it would just like do this
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:18.600]   Like just to prank you randomly right like it could be or is this somebody
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:24.440]   Hacked into people's like i like i don't understand has amazon acknowledged this at all
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:31.400]   They acknowledged it and said they're working on it. They actually technically they acknowledged that people have reported this to them
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:36.520]   I believe we acknowledge that you say there's a problem
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.880]   so uh
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:45.480]   Amazon responded to the creepiness in a statement to the verge saying we're aware of this and working to fix it
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:49.400]   So the fact that they're working to fix it implies that there is something they could do
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:57.240]   That's so weird is this like yeah is this a prank an internal prank like somebody on the last day is like
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.400]   Check this out
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:05.720]   Laugh into the echo database and set it to go on it's randomized in some way that you can't find it
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:11.240]   Oh, that's so weird, but I will say that if in the middle of the night that happened. I would be like which has happened
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:16.120]   Oh, you'd jump out of bed. Yeah, you see the candida watching the horror movie
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:18.680]   No
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.640]   Okay, i'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're gonna do this. We're gonna do this. I'm gonna put it right now
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.680]   You got it is because this is what it would do to you at night
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:28.360]   Um, okay here we go got it set up
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.400]   All right, so it's the uh
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:36.680]   It's in the chat the the the in doc chat for you. Josh. I just said
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.320]   Though I shouldn't give you better like hold on
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:44.760]   Oh, if you just do a search for cat watching horror movie it comes up. You got I think any eyes
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.200]   I think I'm telling you folks. This is worth it. Got a little sound up
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.840]   So you see a cute little kitty
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:58.680]   It's mesmerized watching
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:05.320]   It is cute. Oh my god. Oh, it gets even cuter
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:11.320]   Just keep going the whole yeah, go the whole thing
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:21.800]   This is why the internet is beautiful. Oh my god, this cat. This is me the first time i watched the show
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.800]   Yeah, I really get wider
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.680]   It is in mood. It's like
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:32.280]   Oh, it's pupil actually does all of his face
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:36.520]   What movie are they watching? Oh, it's a woman. Is it psycho?
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.640]   Wait
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:41.640]   Oh
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:54.600]   It's so great cat for those of you who are only listening when you heard the scream guess what the cat did it just
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.600]   Left it away jumped out of the that is what would happen to stacey
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:02.680]   If she heard a laugh in the middle of the night out of her 43
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.440]   Oh man
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.000]   Suddenly all around the house the house is laughing
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:10.040]   uncontrollably and randomly
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.040]   You imagine that like that like
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:16.040]   Standard horror movie like your dolls are suddenly laughing at you cackle that
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:20.200]   Yeah, that would that would not fly
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:25.640]   That's a halloween prank that maybe amazon needs to consider never doing if they want people
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:29.720]   Yes, i'm guessing it's the russians trying to get us to fear our technology
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.280]   That's stranger things seem to be happening right now
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:44.440]   Is there any are there any final stories in here that you guys want to make sure that we get in before we go to tips
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:51.080]   Yeah, I was I was excited about that amazon. Oh, I I think we should do twitter
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:56.120]   rethinking everything yeah because twitter so so and
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:03.000]   I guess I should disclose that i might make a working for the brain. I think what they asked me my opinion before this happened
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:07.000]   Um, so jack dorsey as you may have seen put out a tweet storm
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:14.840]   Um in which he said okay, we recognize that twitter is having an impact on the health of the public conversation
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:17.880]   And we have to do something about that and they've put out an rfp
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:21.560]   To get people researchers and such to help them figure out what to do here
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.800]   They're admitting that they don't know exactly what to do
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.480]   Um
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:31.480]   It's pretty refreshing actually I think twitter one could argue that they should run this sooner fine, but they're doing it
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:36.600]   And and so I wrote a post saying that the the flight to quality is on the runway
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:43.000]   I think we see google facebook and twitter all now grappling with how to deal with manipulation and
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.760]   harassment and trolls and a lack of quality
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.240]   And that's not gonna be easy and they're gonna make mistakes and they're gonna mess some things up
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:56.760]   But I think it's an important they're taking this on themselves. So salute to jack
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:02.120]   Yeah, it's not an easy challenge. Obviously um
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:07.080]   Twitter is not alone. I mean I feel like all of the the big tech companies, you know kind of
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.600]   Kind of attaching to what we're talking about earlier about the big tech
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:16.600]   Uh pushback, but I mean they're all forced to realize at this point that
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:20.760]   There are unintended consequences to their silicon valley
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.640]   Um approach to you know move fast break things and all that all that sort of stuff
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:30.440]   Uh, whether they whether they want to address it or not. They're realizing they kind of have to
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.280]   Uh, yeah, at least jack dorsey's uh taking a good look
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:39.480]   I think it's interesting to open it up to the public and to experts like like she said to say hey
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:42.840]   What ideas you got because it's like we need them right because we need
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:47.240]   And you know meanwhile we see you know when facebook is putting out fires with this
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:51.080]   And and because of a law in germany the nets de gay law in germany
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.000]   They've got to get rid of anything that can be possibly considered as hate speech within 24 hours
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.920]   And they could find a huge amount of money. So satires kind of gone out
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.960]   With the bathwater and so now
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.040]   It's satire
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:06.040]   There you go. Um
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.760]   But so now uh, there's there's a there's a religious satire site
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.720]   I'm forgetting to name it um be something be and they did a funny piece about how
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:17.240]   um
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.240]   CNN has a washing machine
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.160]   For spins like
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:24.440]   It doesn't gain anything in my translation, but that got taken off
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:28.680]   Um because because these systems can't figure out satire
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.920]   So now facebook has to go and try to get help and figure out satire. This is hard stuff
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:35.800]   Yeah, and and snopes apparently
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:42.360]   Heard from people that you know, they were taking the article literally so they ended up debunking it
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.400]   Because snopes has a relationship with facebook
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:52.120]   That ends up signaling the facebook that snopes was on it and that it's actually fake news because that's what that relationship is all about
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.280]   Is this stuff that's posted here real or fake?
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:58.680]   So then facebook ended up hitting up the battle on b was the name of the
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.920]   Thank you, uh, which is very funny
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:07.160]   Administrator to let him know that his satire is getting the smackdown basically which when you read it
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:10.440]   Because of course there isn't a washing machine that spins news
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.400]   Of course not
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.040]   But the problem was when they built the system for the fact checking
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.160]   Yeah, uh, they didn't have a satire box, right?
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.480]   So so snopes had to say well if your uncle abner really thinks this is true
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560]   Okay, we're gonna tell them it's not
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.400]   but the that
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.400]   Triggered the flag because snopes had no opportunity to call satire. Yep
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:33.240]   And and as I say, I said I said 10 times. This isn't easy
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:37.400]   But they're working on it. They're trying. I think that's a positive thing. Yeah, absolutely
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.520]   Yeah, it's hard to draw a line between satire and fake news, you know
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:45.480]   A lot of there are a lot of people that would say off fake news is entirely satire
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:49.560]   It's it's satire to the point of just look at all the fools that fell for it
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:54.200]   You know what I mean? Like that's the point of its existence is to prove that people will fall for anything
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:58.600]   I just saw a story on an off post. It's not on the rundown but um
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.640]   uh, rebecca um
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:04.440]   Who were the back who are the financial backers of um bright part?
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.920]   Rebecca
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:10.520]   I'm I'm happy. I don't know the answer. I guess
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:15.560]   Uh the the bursors the martman sewer man sewer
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:21.160]   Mercer Mercer Mercer Mercer. So the mercers uh gave a bunch of money to the new york
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.960]   Um museum of natural history so some pranksters went in and put in
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.960]   um
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.520]   Things like hey kids build your own fracking
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:33.160]   test
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.200]   Stuff to try to shame the museum out of
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.520]   Taking their money, right?
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:44.200]   And so this notion of fake news and satire and and guerilla theater and it all gets mixed up together
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.440]   And that's the world we live in
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:53.560]   Um data boy definitely gave a brilliant speech today, which I can't wait to go up online at south by south west edu
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:59.640]   About the dangers of getting too addicted to this notion of facts and and media literacy
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.320]   And so it's a complex world that we're expecting the platforms to do
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:08.440]   Binary things and that's what they tend to do is binary things and
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:11.160]   They've got to do things in the grays
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:15.800]   Yeah, anyway. All right. That was the other thing is a confusing world. I put spacey to sleep
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.720]   No, no, sorry. I'm waking up. I'm waking up. No
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.120]   All right, I know what'll wake you up stacy
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:27.800]   You're saying whatever your thing happens to be this week
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:32.440]   Okay, I have I have a double related thing because this is actually related to okay
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.600]   So my thing is a site
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:40.760]   That I read about this week and I started trying out with various devices in my life
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.960]   So it is called hold on. I'm going to find you pre-bot. Is that really what it's called?
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.040]   private or privacy and
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:53.240]   pole lysis
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:59.080]   It's an AI powered summary of any privacy policy and it looks at things like
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.200]   Yeah, so so go check it out
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:06.920]   Pre-bot dot or prybot. Sorry. org pole lysis
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.280]   And you it has a bunch of stuff already loaded
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:16.120]   So you can look at like twitter's privacy policy. It looks at the types of info that they connect collect
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:19.320]   Why they collect it and then the options they give
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:25.720]   So I started running a lot of my iot stuff because one of the things I hate about their data collection is they're like
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:31.880]   Yeah, we're gonna collect all this data and we're gonna share some of it with people most of it's for us and
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:35.960]   Yeah, we want all of it to make our product better. So it's very basic
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:39.320]   but the only option you have if you don't like it is to
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:42.280]   not use it which I think is actually
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:48.280]   In some ways it makes sense because a lot of the connectivity and data collection on these devices is
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.000]   necessary for it to work
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.960]   But another case is you're like dude, I just spent an hour installing a new thermostat and you're telling me that
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:59.560]   If I want to use it, I have to abide by this privacy policy
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:04.440]   And then I'm going to return it and have a restocking fee possibly those kind of things drive units
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.360]   So
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:14.280]   This is fun, but the story that came out I think it was was it yesterday or the day before on movie pass with the ceo saying
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:15.880]   Hey
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:21.240]   We're actually a data driven business and we're going to track you before your movie and after your movie
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:24.920]   None of that's actually in movie pass as privacy
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:29.560]   None of the details are in that privacy policy that they post to users. It doesn't say
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.960]   It says that they're going to get your location
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.400]   You know as part of this, but it doesn't say we're getting your location
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.160]   For whatever amount of time before the movie or after the movie
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.800]   so
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:50.040]   The two things together one it's like hey, this is good, but it also shows how inadequate the current state of privacy
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:53.000]   Disclosure is actually
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.920]   I had no kidding
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:59.480]   I missed that part of the movie the movie pass kind of news from yesterday
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:04.360]   Thought it was very I mean very interesting from the keynote. He he did not care at all
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.840]   You know for base. I want to read I didn't actually watch it
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:11.480]   We'll watch him up there. So I don't know what his tenor was when he was delivering it, but it was like yeah
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:15.960]   We track you before we track you after it's gonna how I interpreted it anyways
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:20.120]   Seemed like he was like yep data's currency and we got all of it
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:25.320]   Right, okay. I guess that's why you're paying eight bucks for a limited movies per month. I guess that's it
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:28.120]   How do you feel about that? You know, maybe maybe it's ten bucks
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.040]   Well, yeah, I think I have some sort of a promo or something for eight bucks
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:39.400]   But so yeah, so that's and that makes sense. I mean again. You don't get anything for free in this world and now
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:45.800]   Free and this is another thing that I think is important with a lot of web services and IOT is
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.360]   We have to actually start
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:56.120]   Understanding that free is not free that there are costs both to your data and privacy, but also even societally
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:01.240]   And you know, I that's a big topic, but we can talk about it another time
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:08.520]   Your pick actually reminds me of I mean this a site that I'm sure you're already familiar with
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:15.800]   TOSDR.org terms of service and read very similar, right? Like it's whole purpose and you can install
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:20.040]   browser add-ons on both of these sites that we're talking about
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:25.240]   Is to let you know about these things that maybe you didn't know about these companies that you're signing up for
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:28.680]   You're agreeing to all that kind of stuff because if you're not
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:34.360]   Pouring through those pages upon pages of text when you sign up for a service, you know
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:37.000]   You could be agreeing to something that is a very bad idea
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.720]   So they they do this to make it a little bit easier for you and I'm happy that they do
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:51.320]   Jeff you've got a few numbers in there what's your view? I found this one charming so uh Chris Hughes who was Mark Zuckerberg's roommate
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.800]   uh one night was
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:59.320]   on his he wasn't a rich kid when he went to Harvard just a smart kid and he was doing his job and
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:02.440]   And he and mark had to have the talk
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:05.560]   They had to have the talk about equity
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:08.040]   so
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:12.440]   None of them knew anything about this stuff, but Hughes was a little more naive and he
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:15.720]   Went to zak and asked him for 10 percent
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:23.080]   And and he and zak went on on on on a walk with one umbrella in the rain zak evidently loves to do all these things on walks
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.080]   And told him no
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:30.680]   What you do is not worth 10 percent and I have to have equity for other people and so he gave him 2 percent
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:34.840]   And at the ipo that 2 percent was worth 500 million
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:38.120]   So I haven't heard a complaint since yeah, no kidding
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:45.960]   I I little little story here. So so way back when back in the day I was uh asked to come to an event for a news
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.280]   Corp actually to moderate a panel with mark zak at berg and nik didn't
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:53.400]   And before he went on
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:54.520]   uh
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.360]   zak was asking nik
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:02.760]   Advice about hiring salespeople and he just mentioned off-handedly something might give me salespeople equity and nik jumped on his throne
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:06.520]   So don't do that salespeople come and go there. You know, they're widgets. You could hire them anytime
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.880]   No, that's you you don't know how valuable your equity is going to be
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:13.160]   True words were never spoken. Yeah, okay
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:16.120]   No kidding
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.160]   We all need to meet a zucker berg and get 2 percent, don't we?
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:21.800]   So you like 0.2 percent
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:24.600]   life goals
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:32.280]   My tip is an app that maybe I looked in the doc and I couldn't see that you guys had ever brought it up on the show
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:37.960]   Maybe it came up somewhere along the line, but we're talking a little bit about android p and some of the fla- uh, the flavors
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:41.560]   Some of the features flavors of an
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.560]   Work poetic. Yeah, we're sure
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:48.600]   Of the new os part of this is smart replies in your notification shade
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:55.240]   And you can do that now actually with an app that google is beta testing right now called reply
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:00.120]   You can't find it in the play store. They're doing a very limited beta test of this
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:05.560]   But i'm linking to the apk mirror site apk mirror created by the folks behind uh android police
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.120]   The trusted place to get some of these apks that are harder to find so you can go there
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.320]   You can download it onto your device and I can even show it off right now
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.960]   Basically what it does it gives you some controls
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.960]   Uh, well, I won't pull up the settings, but it basically gives you controls to determine
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:25.160]   What pieces of your data it can actually use in smart replies and then it connects into
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.560]   Messaging apps so that in your notification shade you get some of these smart replies
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:33.720]   For instance, this was a test from the reply app. It says want to grab dinner
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:40.760]   Interesting that a robot wants me to go to dinner with them, but uh great. I can reply sure i'm down or what time
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:45.880]   I just send that and it sends off uh birk sent me an image of his tablet
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:49.400]   Oh, you know, let me get away from that sent me an image of his tablet
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:53.800]   I wish I had the the preview of that in my notification, but on android p apparently I will
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:56.280]   Is uh, nexis seven that we were talking about earlier
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:03.320]   And so it's a sent an image and I saw it on my browser so I can say hey that looks good. I send that it'll get that reply
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:09.160]   And it makes uh messaging just a little bit easier from a notification shade. So it's called reply
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:11.080]   It's by google
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:14.520]   Um, and if you want to find it you can just search apk mirror.com
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:18.040]   You'll find it there and you can install it and I've noticed that it's really handy
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.440]   It also has like a while driving feature
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.680]   So it detects when your device is in driving mode
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:30.600]   Or that your device detects anyways that you're actually driving and it will cancel any notifications or auto reply to say
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:31.560]   Hey, i'm driving
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:35.480]   I'll get back to you when I park that sort of stuff and there's a bunch of other features that it does
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:36.840]   uh kind of
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:40.040]   intelligently based around like your calendar and all that kind of stuff
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:44.120]   But if you want a little preview of uh what to expect out of android p that's what way to get started
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.080]   I can't wait
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:50.600]   That's cool. I can't see any explanation points exclamation points for yours. So yeah, apparently i'm not that excited
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:54.600]   Is a calm fellow unlike you who's all excited
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:58.520]   You're all you're all caps and all the exclamation points all the time
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.480]   I'm not all caps
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.360]   Okay
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:01.960]   I'm not that curmudgeonly
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:05.560]   And then and then there's a course Donald trump's will be randomly capitalized
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:08.200]   Yeah, yeah, randomly misspelled
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:10.120]   Uh
