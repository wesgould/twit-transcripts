[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.480]   All that and Seth Green's board ape.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.960]   I guess it's gone missing.

[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.120]   No, I do the beyond.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.080]   You're the king of beyond, TikTok.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   That's what I'm-
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.920]   He is after all the Leonard Taft professor for journalistic innovation at the
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:32.200]   school of Journalism at the City of
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.600]   Alice is here back in with us from Tech Dirt fame she is also a
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:46.260]   professional attorney at CG Council dot-com hello Cathy good to see you. Thanks for having me. Welcome. We love having you on
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.320]   Yes, yeah, there's always stuff right up Cathy Cathy's alley. We need the
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:59.220]   Attorney we also need the king of the open web our good friend Kevin Marks is joining us from indy web.org
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.520]   From his home in the on the moors
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:13.000]   Great to have you all of you
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.800]   on a sad day in America
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.100]   Said to say they never seemed to stop
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.960]   unfortunately
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:32.720]   As you know last week ten days ago 11 days ago when the buffalo massacre happened we we heard people blaming twitch and
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.680]   4chan and
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.200]   Discord for both radicalization and communication and so forth. I think again. They're saying
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   There is some involvement with but you gotta stop blaming the internet for this stuff
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.440]   They seem that seems to be the the least
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.400]   culpable agency here and I think I think you know that the
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.040]   Conversation has shifted. I think I think I might want more about Tucker Carlson about Murdoch
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.640]   Yeah, about media as well as a whole and less about about the internet per se. I
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.160]   Mean I'll be honest. I will defend
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.760]   Tucker Carlson's right to say whatever he wants. Oh, you can say whatever he wants
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.960]   But doesn't mean Rupert Murdoch should be paying him to say it well or you or Rupert
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.080]   I mean, I guess you know he owns the presses so I guess he can say what he wants, but you know
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.080]   That's protected speech, but that doesn't protect him from
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.720]   Blame and enigma me enigma me you know what I'm saying
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:38.960]   So the problems the outrage conflates the issues so I get very nervous about okay great
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.120]   They're not you know people aren't kicking the internet and my job is to protect the internet
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.080]   So okay, that's relief except they're still taking issue with
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.600]   Some things that are First Amendment protected because I don't think people see the difference of the toggle between
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.840]   There ought to be a law that ought to be illegal versus
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.360]   That kind of crap up with which we should not put and I think that's a very different question about what we should tolerate
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.160]   As polite society as acceptable messages within our midst versus what we should have a law to make sure it can never be spoken
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.800]   And because there's not a good understanding of that difference
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.840]   you end up seeing things that are we should ban Fox News and I think we should not watch Fox News
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.600]   But that's a very fundamental different question of saying that the government should step in and make it impossible to watch
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.320]   Absolutely agree absolutely agree
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.440]   In fact in some ways you can I mean honestly
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   I'd like to blame the judiciary
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:43.160]   That released Kyle Rittenhouse after he used an assault weapon on people on the streets and found him not guilty
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.880]   That was a message to 18 year olds all over the country. It's okay
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.120]   So I mean there's lots of blame to go around
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.960]   I want to blame my cable company for making me pay for Fox News
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.400]   Good point. Good point. That's an interesting distinction. You could
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.600]   We could push cable companies as its customers to stop carrying crap like that. Well or even not that even
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.400]   You know, they're not carrying RT anymore. So fine. They have a right just like Twitter does to decide what they carry
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.280]   What they don't you can't leave you can't stop them legally, but we could as customers say something
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.080]   We could have a and all a cart which has come up again and again and again, but but the if you want to
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.880]   an ad boycott of
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.680]   Fox is meaningless because the pillow guy's gonna be there no matter what right and and Murdoch doesn't really make his money now that way
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.000]   He makes it from subscriptions either directly Wall Street Journal or indirectly through carriage fees and cable
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.640]   Right and if we didn't all pay for Fox and chose not to that would have an economic impact on him Kevin
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.360]   You know, you're in the UK sitting on the outside
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.920]   Looking in you lived in the US for a long time
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.400]   Do people think we're nuts?
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.900]   Yeah, I mean broad. I mean we had a school shoot UK
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.760]   27 years ago
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   similar one where somebody went into a
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   primary school and shot a lot of children
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.560]   And we passed a gun ban within a year and it was a hand gun ban as well
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.080]   So yeah, there was there was a response to that and it's a response that here and similarly in Australia. They've passed
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.640]   Weapon bands as well. Yes. Yes, it would be hard in America because there are many more people with weapons and many more weapons
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.400]   But it's not impossible. We have five percent of the global population 42 percent of the global guns
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.040]   But I think a third of America owns those guns
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.840]   So it's once again as we constantly see these days. It's the tyranny of the third. Yeah, and and I'm I you know
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.400]   I today somebody on on Twitter said
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.920]   You know, I'm a proud non-gun people talk about their proud gun owners was me
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.760]   Well, I'm a proud non-gun owner and I'm a proud non-gun owner
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.760]   I have never fired what I never intend to
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.360]   Yeah, maybe it's time. I mean for a long time. We've kind of a little bit cot-tat and said well, you know
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:07.120]   It's we have the right the second amendment blah blah blah. Maybe it's time to stay. No, no, you know, it's time to stop
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:14.160]   Let's let's you know, it's low-hanging fruit. We could go for first the problem is is the conversation is so polarized where
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.680]   okay, let's accept that there's
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   An appropriately libertarian argument for why certain weapons should be ownable by the population
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.600]   But it doesn't necessarily mean that it extends quite as far as it's getting extended
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.260]   I think there's a lot we could do before we actually start
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:39.400]   Bumping up against what should our inalienable rights actually be there's a lot of sense you could bring to the policy discussion
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.600]   To where you haven't really interfered with the liberties, but you have sort of
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.440]   Maybe bottled up some of the more
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.840]   Risky consequences that we keep tempting but we're not having a reasonable conversation
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.080]   Everything is very polarized all or nothing and you're I just don't think we're gonna get to something sensible if those are the two
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.920]   Polar positions and nothing can exist in the middle
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:07.680]   I do I little bit of a little bit of a bright light I guess
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:14.840]   The news media at least as far as I could tell is not naming the shooter in the last two events
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.560]   Which I think is is exactly right. I don't think there should be any glory associated with this
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:27.000]   No one should mistake. Well, that's something but but but the man all the mainstream coverage I saw
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.840]   Barely mentioned the shooter as it as it as is right as it should but the but the fringe media and the you're posted
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.120]   Maybe the places that those people go
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.720]   Or firing them. Yeah, but yeah, no, but they did worse than that in the shooter
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.240]   No, yeah, they they lied about the shooter and they said they made up a bunch of stuff about it
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.960]   It wasn't true
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.440]   Yeah, they named innocent people as the shooter
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.280]   So in a sense we all in the
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.320]   Stunning accurate information people have been making stuff up and in a way that's actually causing harm
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:05.600]   So maybe it isn't really the way to it's hard to know what the right most ethical and responsible way to report on this
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.080]   Actually is because you're sort of damned if you do and damned if you don't if you don't give credible information people
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.640]   Gapped fill and they get filled badly. So that's a problem
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.240]   But on the other hand if you give the credible information then there's consequences of what does it mean for that information to be known?
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.960]   All right, well, I was just trying to give somebody some credit
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:31.920]   Oh man
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.040]   And I didn't really I think we have to acknowledge it. I didn't really plan to spend a lot of time talking about it
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.940]   But I think we do have to have to acknowledge it such a great
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:49.960]   Tragedy that happened 10 years ago at Sandy Hook and should never have happened again never ever happened again and it's time maybe to stop
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.840]   soft pedaling this and start taking a hard line on it and
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:01.640]   Last night this is gonna sound ridiculously trivial in this context, but but I was last night Fred Gothenburg who's just heart-rending
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.700]   When he speaks about this was all when Nicole Wallace one of the parents of Sandy Hook
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.600]   No of of Parkland Parkland, okay
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.920]   whose daughter was
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.000]   Isn't it sad that we had that we have so many that we confuse him
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.840]   His daughter would now be a freshman college and he's watching his friends children in college where his daughter is not
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:28.640]   Last night he I won't do it for this. I don't want to get John mad, but he used the F word and
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.920]   And I thought oh, I'm gonna you know watch MSNBC's gonna apologize for this and I'm gonna get really angry
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.640]   They didn't and they put up video even though they in the text they didn't use it
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.580]   but they put up the video and and you know I dare the FCC to come and complain about a
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:50.800]   Passing obscenity if ever there were inappropriate use exactly it and so the other thing is interesting
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.480]   I don't know if you saw it because you were you were on your air quotes error
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.240]   But baby, it's the air. I'm floating through the air
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   some better work
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.720]   Yeah, Beto interrupted governor Abbott's
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.240]   Unseemly which was unseemly
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.480]   Fundraising event the very next day
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.080]   Right, right, which I think was was great
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.080]   And I think that we're we're at a take no prisoners moment on this well, that's kind of how I feel
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.760]   I feel like yeah
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.480]   I see a lot of rhetoric especially from senators who have to deal with the other 50 senators saying well
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.800]   Maybe we can do some minor compromise. We got to do something better than nothing
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:37.760]   You know what vote the sons of bitches out in November period. It is time to say for the majority to stand up and say no more
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.840]   Period it is the majority it is the majority and you know what they're gonna keep taking money from the NRA
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.160]   The NRA is gonna have it's I thought the NRA was bankrupt by the way. I really don't understand that they give 13 million dollars to
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.600]   Romney I literally thought they were bankrupt. Where's this money coming from?
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:08.720]   Let's talk about the Florida social media law because Kathy you've got an article in this week's tech dirt about
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:17.920]   I you know and the way the tech dirt capitalizes titles is really it's is good the problem with the otherwise very good and very
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.000]   Important 11th Circuit decision on the Florida social media law
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:28.080]   So first of all is SB 70 72 like the Texas social media law
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:36.880]   Okay, so we can't escape this conversation not talking about Texas Texas is also going to be relevant to what we're talking about
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.040]   And
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.800]   Texas just filed something at the fifth circuit saying our bill is totally different than the Florida one
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.040]   So this 11th Circuit decision that largely flew throughout the Florida social media bill
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.240]   the Council for the plaintiff the felon the plaintiffs who are challenging it submitted as a
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:04.840]   You know supplemental authority like your fifth circuit while you consider authoring an actual decision about how you want to adjudicate this appeal
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.920]   You might want to know that your fellow circuit over here
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.240]   Took the bulk of it the bulk of the law that was trying to regulate content moderation in general and said
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:19.120]   The 11th Circuit found that it implicated the First Amendment rates of platforms
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:25.000]   So they just went back to the fifth circuit and said by the way, you might want to know that that's how a fellow court decided things
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.160]   How bound is the fifth these are both federal courts of appeal, but is the fifth in any way bound by what the 11th does?
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.680]   Do they are they completely standalone independent?
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.200]   So they are standalone independent the 11th Circuit would be regarded as persuasive authority
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.080]   But the circuits are free to do what they want except there's also supposed to follow
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.080]   Circuit precedent and national precedent. So if the Supreme Court has actually articulated something then the circuits are all bound to
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.280]   They can't they're not suppresses come up with it. Yeah
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.800]   They have to be consistent with what the Supreme Court said now
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:07.320]   That gives you a lot of wiggle room as a court because then you basically try to argue that what the Supreme Court said is
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.640]   Inappable to the case before you but they're supposed to follow that
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   So when the 11th Circuit looks at
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.880]   Supreme Court precedent and says based on the things that the Supreme Court has said before when we apply it to this type of law
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:26.080]   We think that there's a problem. It's bumping up against the First Amendment interests of the platforms and we've decided that's unconstitutional
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:32.520]   But the problem is is the reason we have to go back to Texas is so both states had their own laws
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.320]   They'll that they came out Florida had their their law which involved the weird theme park exception
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.720]   Where to apply to all platforms unless they happen to also own a theme park as part of their corporate assets
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.400]   And Texas by the way given how
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.080]   Governor DeSantis feels about Disney these days. They probably wouldn't have left that in. Oh, they took it out
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.080]   They actually took it out
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.240]   While it was getting in the appeal process
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.200]   They actually we don't like your to woke. We're taking out
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.760]   So they took it out and then they had and then they wrote to the court while it was busy
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.400]   You know chewing on this decision to update the court to say by the way the theme park exemption is no longer in the
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.920]   In the law
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.520]   But it's kind of like you know from the other side the people challenging it is kind of like yes
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.400]   They're right, you know
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:27.480]   This just shows how arbitrary and capacious and how offensive it is to first amendment editorial judgment that like you would toggle it about
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.960]   Like who your political enemies are and this is who you're gonna target with your law
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:37.800]   What was the show title last week Leo? I don't remember. What was it about laws that are made just for one party?
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:43.400]   Is this a quiz? I don't I was only I was only half year last week
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.360]   Oh, no wasn't last week
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:54.480]   I just got myself
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.960]   Bill of a tanger good old bill of a tanger
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.080]   Who could forget him? William? Oh, yes
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:10.300]   So both states had these laws that kind of did slightly different things like they had a slightly different focus
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.300]   Florida's is more about
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.720]   journalism and political campaigns and Texas maybe that was the political campaign
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.100]   They had a little bit difference in their orientation
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:24.160]   But basically they were fundamentally that the state wanted to tell big tech platforms
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.240]   How they got to do their moderation and put a lot of what our requirements that would take away their ability to do it freely
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.840]   Let's be in the new spirit of calling
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:38.320]   Things what they really are this was don't ban Donald Trump from Twitter law
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.560]   Yeah, it boils down to
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:48.560]   Yeah, but you're not allowed to ban Donald Trump from Twitter law, okay, right
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.400]   You keep going with that. I'm gonna have a question for you keep going
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.720]   Okay, so both states had laws like these and both states laws got challenged and in both instances
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.320]   District courts looked at them and said
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:08.520]   We're gonna join this or at least most of it because we see that this is conflicting with the First Amendment rights of platforms
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.880]   So the laws were enjoined nothing could happen with those laws
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.120]   Then each state appeals because they're unhappy with that they want their law
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.440]   So Florida appeals to the 11th circuit and that appeal was heard first
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.840]   But then we were waiting for a decision for a while which is not abnormal
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:31.920]   It usually takes a long time to get a decision and then Texas had appealed and that was heard by the fifth circuit in an oral argument
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.080]   That didn't really go very well. It was very strange
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.880]   Sort of some of the questions being put back at the planet. Oops
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:43.360]   But then it quieted down, but then all of a sudden out of the blue two or three weeks ago
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.320]   Both laws were currently enjoined and then the fifth circuit with no explanation whatsoever
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.840]   It came out of the woodwork and said with a two-to-one
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   Decision we're gonna stay the injunction which basically in this one line order said guess what the Texas law gets to go into effect right now
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.920]   Whatever a constitutional effect. It has be damned. It wasn't going to talk about it
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   It didn't explain why I thought it wasn't defending the First Amendment
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:19.480]   It put it in and the Texas law is active law right now pending of course is still on trial and pending a judgment down the road
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:26.720]   But it's impending that they actually issue a ruling on its constitutionality which it we're still waiting for so then this
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:34.400]   Led to an emergency application to the US Supreme Court by the plaintiff challengers to say hang a second
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.560]   We need some relief because this is a really bad law
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.320]   We definitely think it's implicating our First Amendment rates and how can this be live?
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.560]   We can't even appeal it because there's nothing to appeal because there's no decision
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:50.940]   So we shadow-docketed there's an emergency application to the US Supreme Court to ask it to give the
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:57.040]   Some relief and I wrote an amicus brief in support of this. So I have shadow-docketed too
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   Oh good. So now we're waiting
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.760]   The justice in charge of the fifth circuit is
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.240]   Samuel O'Lillino
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.480]   Now he did issue an order to make the state respond
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:16.440]   So the state had to put in a filing so there's some tea leave reading that suggests that this is being taken seriously
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:24.320]   He could do two things he could send it back say no not gonna get involved or he could then refer it to the other justices
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:31.680]   I'm not entirely sure what all the options are because the show is really and yeah
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:37.720]   It's under articulated the US Supreme Court is normally very regimented with a ton and ton of rules
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.280]   Including if you're filing like as an amicus there's a ton of rules ordinarily
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.280]   But in this case there's no rules
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.240]   They have some proposed ones
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.200]   But basically this is sort of like they're making it up as they go along
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.960]   Which is really not something you want to see in your judicial system
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.080]   But nonetheless it's sort of as a litigator
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:00.280]   It gave you a little freedom of like I didn't have to like spend money on expensive printing because that wasn't a rule here
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.440]   We just kind of shoved it in with like this looks reasonable. I think they'll take it
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.680]   This is really not how you want to do your more and more of these shadow-talk it orders unfortunately
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.120]   Right so where we are now is
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.720]   Nothing's come out of the Supreme Court yet. Nothing's come out of the Fifth Circuit to explain its order
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.440]   But really this week the 11th Circuit
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.400]   I think rushed out their decision and their decision
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:33.040]   took aim at most of the Florida law to say this is really colliding with First Amendment rights platforms and
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.640]   Gave a very full-throated analysis to talk about how a lot of the arguments like common carry edge
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:46.160]   And this then the other thing we're like nope. There's this is this is wrong. You've really done something that's unconstitutional. So it mostly
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.680]   Continued the injunction on most of the Florida law
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.440]   My textured post is raising concern that they didn't fully enjoy it
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.040]   They let a few provisions go through and I think it's problematic that they did
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.920]   But it's not the end of the litigation train for that
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.040]   But that only shuts down the Florida law the Texas law is still alive
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:11.800]   And we need somebody to give us some relief or at least some explanation on why did the Texas law get to go into effect
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:18.240]   Given that the 11th Circuit has just articulated a very sensible basis of why these types of laws are
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:26.040]   Hugely problematic and interfere with First Amendment rights in Florida or will Florida then send that to the Supreme Court or do you know?
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.760]   I would not put it
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.400]   I would not be surprised if they did but to do it was the
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.320]   Justice in charge of the 11th Circuit
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:41.440]   You know all the judges on the 11th Circuit who rendered this unanimous opinion were all appointed by
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:47.440]   Republican presidents at some point in time one is a Trump judge one is even gives a Bush judge of some sort and I think
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.920]   one was a
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.800]   Fort or somebody so yeah, so this was something where even conservative
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:01.520]   Clarence Thomas Clarence Thomas is the justice who would hear a shadow docket. Oh geez
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:10.680]   So anyway, oh I see what your point is you get I'm saying who's the Alito for the 11th Circuit? It's Clarence Thomas
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.640]   well, so
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.920]   The other thing though is so I told you there were amicus briefs that went in in support of this emergency application
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.160]   Most of them went in in support of the amicus application
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.520]   But there's a cop to went in in support of Texas because Texas had to say no no no our laws totally fine
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.880]   Leave us alone. Nothing is a year ago. I and they had two amicus briefs one of which was by Florida
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:37.120]   And I think a bunch of other very red states that showed up to say this is totally fine
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.680]   We should totally be able to regulate the internet the way these laws are articulated
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:47.360]   So they've kind of already presented themselves to the Supreme Court a little bit and I don't think it's a mystery to the court
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.160]   What Florida thinks about it?
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.520]   But the procedural posture of this is a is very strange
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.120]   It's always strange a little bit because there's always options and sort of like chess
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.120]   Strategy that you get to play out in terms of how do you litigate something from beginning to end?
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:10.880]   But it's definitely extremely strange because we're in shadow docket land and normal rules are not applying and what the fifth circuit did to in that one line order
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.360]   Unleash a law that there had already been a very articulate
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.000]   Decision saying was unconstitutional and they just let it go out into the world anyway
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.120]   Yes, that's very strange from an adjunctive standpoint. Let me ask you if these laws were about a newspaper instead of social media
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:36.160]   Would this there still be the same back and forth over this or would it just be no obviously?
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.800]   You can't do that
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.360]   There are some open questions about what is the right?
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:48.720]   Analog to apply to the internet so to some extent this is not completely ridiculous
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.960]   But on the other hand so I'm my some really an
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:57.200]   Weird analysis of precedent going on with this so I wouldn't even trust that newspapers are necessarily
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.200]   So we're kind of making it up as we go. Oh, okay. Can I ask another question Kathy that the
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:08.800]   I make the first amendment argument obviously constantly and the compelled speech is not free speech is a tattoo
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   I'm gonna get put on my chest
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   But I have a different
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.800]   basis
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   for this question if
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.120]   a bar
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.360]   Can say I don't want to serve Leo. I don't serve people in white shirts. I don't like them
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:31.000]   I you just you can't come in here, right? They have that right I should explain. I am wearing a white shirt today
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.200]   Some sort of you know euphemism for the
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   Anything I just happened to be
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   The secret McKinsey consultant
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:50.320]   White white polo shirt, yes give me
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:57.480]   Right, so but a bar as an establishment as a private establishment could say we choose whom to serve as long as you don't do it
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.000]   On the basis of race and other other protected classes, right?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.400]   Why?
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.160]   Is that not also the same for a Twitter that we choose no see that's that's what I was gonna
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:14.880]   Get it with my question too was are we tweeting social tweeting are we tweeting social media as different somehow?
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.640]   from
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   what you know
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.080]   Standards would be for other
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   You know businesses or journalism or apparently not
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.280]   Well, I lost the rest of my question
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.680]   He's saying basically a business can say no to Leo
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:39.440]   I would say you can't tell a newspaper what it can or cannot do and that seems like established laws
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.880]   How can you suddenly tell Twitter? Yeah, they must serve
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:50.400]   So the the reason the argument that Texas and Florida would make is that
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:58.160]   They start to throw out two ideas both of which were fully rebuffed by the 11th circuit and correctly so
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.160]   But one of them is this idea that
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.680]   Social media is quote-unquote and I use it in quotes derisively because I don't buy this at all
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.880]   But it's the new public square and that if you are the new public square
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:15.440]   You have a different sort of duty to all comers and this is the second idea that they throw around which is oh
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.920]   And you are a common carrier so they must take all comments
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.480]   So there so they basically try to look at these businesses and say oh no no you're not the bar anymore
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:31.760]   You're something special because you're different and you're so integral to the functioning of modern society that you are now subject to additional
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.240]   Regulatory burdens that strip you of editorial discretion and now you have to serve all comers
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.840]   Which leads you farther down the path that you you would have to accept everything everything legal yes
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:48.720]   Yeah, I mean one of the things that's been argued in these appeals is and it came up like Wallace was getting litigated
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   the emergency application to the Supreme Court was pending when we had Buffalo and
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.600]   There was the issue of the the culprit had live streamed it and twitch took it down
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:05.040]   And there's a very arguable case that under the text of social media law. It was not legal for twitch to take it down
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   That's a really terrible situation
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:15.640]   We're in if if platforms really have their hands tied were some really awful content cannot be removed because there's liability
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.980]   Associated with removing content like this is not the world we want to
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:24.740]   But again, it's very clear that neither legislature was thinking about things like that they were thinking about Donald Trump and
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.580]   That these are these are very purpose-built
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:32.140]   Jerry rigged with the most ridiculous arguments laws that
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:37.860]   Baffles me that they are getting any protection at all from the courts
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.940]   I mean the only protection I mean if Apple says Leo can't come to an Apple event
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:50.440]   No one to say that's I mean no one would reasonably say that's illegal you Leo. It's your wardrobe
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:55.240]   Well, whatever I mean and it seems to me that's well established precedent
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:02.060]   Yes, and the fact that they're coming up with these fakotka ideas. That's a public square or it's a common carrier
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.780]   It's BS and I'm amazed that the Fifth Circuit
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.580]   Could even you know countenance that?
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:16.220]   Well, yeah, I mean and it's not entirely clear to what extent the Fifth Circuit how badly it got it wrong because it hasn't shown
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.500]   It's works. We don't know it quite how badly it got it wrong. Why is that why is that?
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.660]   Is that a new thing to I mean I guess if you do a if you have a full ruling you have a you write an opinion
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:32.060]   That's the problem of the shadow docket - isn't it that there's no opinion. Yeah, there's a very
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:38.660]   Judicial process as we've known it has I mean it evolves over time
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.540]   But it's definitely been taking some very sharp left turns
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.620]   I don't mean left right in a political sense
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.740]   But just sort of like all of a sudden shifting from
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:51.340]   Stayed boring evolving slowly into all of seven some which is ironic changes
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:54.100]   happen these are all
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:30:00.300]   Originalists and construction is doing it. That's what's the stir. Yeah, I mean and
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:05.380]   Yeah, I mean and the originalism runs into a problem because they're all like well
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:10.060]   This is what was true in 1780. It's like yeah, but we also had the 14th amendment like we had
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:16.660]   Amendments because we had to tune things up. It's obvious. They're not constructionists. It's obvious. They just use that as
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:21.940]   No, the judicial process itself can change without really offending the Constitution the problem is
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.820]   Depends what it's changing into and right now it's changing rather radically where they're changing the rules on the
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:33.340]   fly in a way that was is the end they want to actually achieve like process tends to be get
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.780]   Substance and so very sort of oh, this is just a change in how we
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:45.180]   Traditionally process this case all of a sudden is having huge substantive effects and the fifth circuit in particular has been
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:52.580]   very troubling and sort of how it's been handling itself and it's then feeding into the Supreme Court which then also has been changing the
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:58.580]   rules about how it processes cases and all of this has been having tremendous substantive effect and all the lawyers who like
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.620]   Litigating these courts are kind of like throwing up their hands of like I don't know what the rules are anymore
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.860]   This is and I will get back to it because I think it's a fair accusation
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.740]   It's turning the courts into Calvin ball and this is not a great way to have rule of law
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.140]   The fact that like you know
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:19.740]   I can train as a litigator and I'm still in the dark about what it would actually take to press a client's case
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.220]   That's not an okay position to be in like all the skills I have are kind of like yeah
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.820]   Maybe they're useful, but it's a whole new ball game now and it's not supposed to be a whole new ball game right now
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.860]   Kevin to the Brits think we're crazy
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:39.460]   Every 15 minutes
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:50.340]   You have your own you have the Snoopers charter you have the worst thing going on right now is party
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:54.060]   Number 10 that's that's what's what's turning the country apart now
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:02.940]   Party that happened. Yeah a year ago. There is no first amendment in in the UK
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:08.460]   Oh, right or in common law is there or I mean, it's not a um it's a US
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:14.100]   concept yeah, there wasn't a first there wasn't the equivalent of first amendment in the same way there is there are
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.380]   There's a reason people sue for libel in London
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.140]   because the libel
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:26.900]   Laws have got a different basis here and if you're being sued you've got a proof you didn't say something to family which is tricky right?
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:32.860]   And and the defense is a difference so you can you can make a defensive truth, but you can't make a defensive
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:38.020]   Public interest in the same way I think which is why you have such a fabulous tab
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:47.700]   Although in England's credit England like had blackstone that came up with some common law rules that actually were protective of free speech
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:54.940]   So for instance in America under the first amendment prior restraint is not supposed to happen and we got that actually from England
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.940]   That predates the United States that
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.420]   Judge blackstone had articulated that
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:07.260]   Restrains on speech prior to adjudication is not something that the concept of free expression could tolerate and we took that and we've
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.940]   We've had other decisions that are consistent with it
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:15.540]   Which in my Supreme Court brief is a point that we made that this order that all of a sudden lets
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:24.860]   a law challenge the free rights of free expression is all of a sudden being let loose with no real adjudication about whether it's okay
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.820]   Or not starts to have qualities of prior restraint to it which really shouldn't be allowed
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.940]   This is first amendment free speech. You've got to like take care of that
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.380]   Judge blacks
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:41.180]   Ring the bell once you've chilled speech blood judge blackstone's commentaries were published in the 18th century in the UK on British law and
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:49.300]   Presumably were read and understood by the founders. So that's well. Well, the other person read understood by the founders was was my hero John Wilkes
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:55.260]   the great troll and if you really want to have fun study his history and
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:02.180]   Some argue that the Bill of Rights was a great measure inspired by Wilkes and the rights he fought for
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.620]   Being frankly quite a jerk and print, but it was his right to be so
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:15.620]   Okay, let's take a little break with that. I hope you've enjoyed our little law class here. This is fun actually
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.620]   I love having Kathy on and
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:22.300]   Later on you'll watch me bag Leo to show you a charming moment from TikTok, but that's
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:27.740]   Charming moments from TikTok
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.740]   That's Jeff's favorite favorite thing. He's a troll in his own
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:34.340]   right
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:41.280]   Hey, let me I've got a topic for I'm sorry. I've got a topic for Kevin - good. That's great. That's great
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.900]   Kevin you started as a coder, right? You were at the BBC writing code for them went to Apple
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:52.000]   Worked on quick time there. Do you get to code at all anymore? Yeah?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.940]   I'm doing some coding. I'm actually running some code for the BBC at the moment again, which is nice
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:02.620]   I'm doing a bunch of freelance things on my own. What do you what do you write it? What code what language do you like to write?
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:08.580]   Well, everyone needs to write it in I mean it's mixture of different things. I've currently I'm writing stuff in node PHP Python
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.340]   JavaScript
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   Yeah, yeah, you're job scripts. No, but also I've done see in
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.540]   When you first do you remember the first language you learned? What was it was it?
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.740]   I think basic on the time X or the BBC Sinclair or
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.500]   Yeah, look at that. He's right to his not only
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.580]   He's got only that for the
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:39.820]   Turkey set this thing Claire's man. This is this is illustrating basic which was a handwritten book about how to write programs that was published in
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:44.660]   19 he went all the way back to the main pre Gutenberg manuscript
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.640]   77 yeah, no 77. You know what's funny. I have my
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:53.780]   Kernahan and Richie the C programming language from the pretty much the same year. I think
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:36:01.220]   Annotated in ink by me from way back. There it is. You got that you have to go get mine
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.500]   Oh, you do
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.420]   I'm a attorney. I've been rich you do you read code?
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:14.540]   Well, I was a web developer. So I wrote a lot of friend Dan. Oh, yeah, this is what I did before I went to law school
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:18.540]   I mean I didn't do it was you reasonably
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:24.220]   Figured out that the internet and the web wasn't going anywhere. So you were gonna take go to law school
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:30.220]   I was alarmed by people who didn't understand the internet or how people used it nonetheless
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:36.140]   Regulating it so I went to law school so I could perfect help them not regulate it bad. We need you. That's great
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.180]   I'm so glad you I'm so glad you're doing that the reason I ask is our
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:45.340]   sponsor today a lot of us learned basic or see in the early days our
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.100]   sponsor today code Academy if it had been around
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:55.780]   Back then might have been the way to learn if you've wanted to learn how to program if you've wanted to change your career
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.220]   With code Academy you can learn to code
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:06.420]   On your own terms and I've taken their Python courses. They're great over 50 million people
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:13.180]   I'm not alone already know that code Academy is the best way to learn to code because code Academy not only teaches you job ready coding skills
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:18.020]   It also helps you build unique projects for your portfolio. That's very important to get that first job
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.980]   You get a certificate you could put on your LinkedIn and or in your resume
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.860]   You can even prep for technical interviews with code Academy when I
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:32.620]   Wanted to brush up my Python. I went to code Academy for a couple of reasons one you're coding from day one
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:37.740]   Right away the very first thing you do is right and submit some code
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.980]   They have Python they have JavaScript the HTML CSS. They have sequel
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:47.340]   You and if you go there and you say well, I don't know do I want to be a full stack engineer
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:52.500]   I do I want to do front end back end of my interest in computer science and my all about statistics
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.520]   I've got a great suggestion for you. They have a programming
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.700]   Personality quiz you can take and it'll give you tailored career advice
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.260]   Not based on what you know or your mathematical ability or anything like that
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:09.620]   But on your strengths and interests on your personality. I took it. They said computer science is the way to go for you
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:15.140]   Lisa took it it said statistics you should learn are you're a you're a number and it was absolutely right
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:20.660]   It was absolutely right so code Academy can point you in the right direction get your coding fast
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:25.660]   You choose what you want to learn from basic websites to artificial intelligence
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:31.260]   Everything in between and no matter what your experience level you'll be writing real working code in minutes
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.220]   In fact if you've never written any code, I kind of envy you
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:39.260]   This is the you know really the best right cannot really recommend learning basic first
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:46.020]   This is the best way to get started not typing in code from a magazine. We were talking about that earlier today
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:51.260]   You'll learn how to code right with an interactive platform that helps you learn by doing
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.620]   You'll get a certificate of completion
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:59.820]   Which is a really handy thing to have to get that first job web development programming computer science data science
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.300]   If you want to learn a new skill if you want to just have some fun
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:10.060]   If you want to troubleshoot tech issues if you want to transition into a new career code Academy is a great place to do it
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:17.220]   Join over 50 million people learning to code. That's kind of amazing. What a number at code Academy
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:21.660]   See where coding can take you get 15% off your code Academy Pro membership
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.420]   When you go to code Academy calm use a promo code twig
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.980]   TWIG code
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:34.660]   Academy calm 15% off code Academy broke the best way to learn to code of course you could start it for free as well
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.660]   C O D E C A D E

[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:46.700]   code Academy actually I'm going backwards in time
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.100]   Kevin I
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.620]   Wish I wish 40 years. What is the there's the old Japanese?
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.780]   Proverb that the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago the next best time is today
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.900]   And I feel like the best time for me to have learned emacs and Lisp was 40 years ago
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:09.740]   But I love it now and that's what I put and I figure this is a lifelong for the rest of my life
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.060]   I'll be learning emacs because it's you never stop, but I really I love it
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:18.860]   I almost just want to not use a GUI at all anymore. Just do it. I know it's crazy. That's nuts
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.780]   but
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:26.060]   So be it. I'm a geek. What can I say? I never quite went into the whole emacs thing, right?
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.900]   No, I know you're smart not to because it's a it's kind of a
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:34.460]   It's a simple thing. Yeah, it's a steep learning curve
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:38.380]   Kevin V I or emacs, which would you pick?
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:43.300]   I'd pick the eye because I can actually use that one. Yeah, but I wouldn't pick it on purpose
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.620]   I'd use be a BB a bit or or VS code is very good VS code VS code
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:54.940]   VS code I use VS code of the time, but I use I still use BB as well because it does it does a bunch of things well
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:59.620]   I love BB edit actually the really good act like deep dipping. You know, like yeah
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:06.000]   Dipping is very good and grep I use their grep all the time if I have a large text file that I need a massage
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.940]   It's really great, but I but I bet I could do it in emacs if I only knew the chords
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.980]   Yeah, or you can use grep. Yeah, you can use grep there was a
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:24.380]   nasty advent of code problem last year where
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:30.900]   It was just a massive I solved it with a massive grep problem smarter people did it a little bit better
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:35.400]   But man, it was it's kind of fun to get deep back into grep. Grep is such a
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:42.380]   inscrutable language that you probably shouldn't ever use it, but if you can it's fun I
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:50.060]   Actually, I feel like the next question is and what is your favorite shell? I use fish. What do you use?
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:57.340]   Me I don't know I think I was yeah, I think I was
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:04.340]   But it's been even apples and bash and apples of passion uses as each shell now is the default
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:09.020]   Yeah, I'm using these people switch to know me. Yeah, I like Z shell use the shell for a long time
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:14.620]   But fish is a little I don't know. It's a little more modern. I like the way fish works. Nothing's modern
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:21.340]   Fish I think fish is mono is something like shell programming the way it's supposed to be like the eight in the eighties or something
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.340]   I can't remember there. It's ridiculous
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:29.980]   All right enough geeking out back to the news v. Con we were talking about this before
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.020]   The show began Gary Vee
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.060]   Gary Vaynerchuk who has been on this show as a friend of the show
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:43.580]   He he started as an early podcaster with wine club TV where he would make wine
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:49.140]   Recommendations because his family owned a wine store. I go to that store to this day. Yeah, I get my my sins
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.140]   Met what's it called?
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.420]   Wine library. That's it. So wine library TV was his show and then he
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:02.100]   Somehow turned himself into some sort of marketing
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:09.020]   Guru everybody loved him because of the show and he did a daily show 40 minutes a day doing wines
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:14.220]   Of course everybody loved and then they kind of came to him and he ended up showing up at all these conferences
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.660]   Like look who's going to in this neat thing who understands the internet. Yeah, that was kind of what it was
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:23.620]   Yeah, yeah passed into if I know that I must know everything on earth. Yeah, and people say
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.060]   You bring wine to the conference
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.660]   True the conference was like several cases of wine and
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.140]   Organized tastings for you. So that made him to his credit
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:41.740]   He took his notoriety as a podcaster and became he created an agency that does big stuff now big advertising agency
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:47.220]   He created a restaurant reservation app called resi sold that to American Express
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:51.420]   So he's done he's done quite well and of late
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:59.260]   He has become I'm sad to say like so many of my friends. He's fallen down the NFT rabbit hole
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:05.100]   Oh, no, no big time. He is he is Alice in Wonderland
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.380]   of NFTs
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:15.500]   Conference four days in Minneapolis was called V con V double econ. I mean he's become I mean he's now
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.740]   V he's V he's V con at the US Bank Stadium
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.580]   Our French hero Lazar was one of the moderators there
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:28.420]   Kevin Rose who has done very well Senate selling
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.940]   NFTs
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.940]   so it's really interesting
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:38.260]   Kevin bought in early into the zombie series. These are just little cartoons you buy and
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:43.940]   You know you kind of have some sort of weird digital ownership of this of this zombie and
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:47.580]   You know he bought it early when it was one of the very first
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:53.180]   I think was the first NFT collection. He bought it early for you know 500 bucks at last count
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.180]   It was worth like four hundred thousand dollars
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:00.140]   So then there was the board apes yacht club similar idea
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:04.380]   They hire I feel bad for the artist because they fire some artists
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:11.700]   For hire pay him a flat fee to draw you know a thousand board apes and then there were millions
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:19.980]   Kevin got together with people who's a well-known NFT artist and a few other and I think Gary was involved in this
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.380]   Created a group they created owls
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.940]   Right cartoon owls
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.380]   Kevin had to post a video on YouTube a couple of weeks ago saying yeah
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:36.860]   I know we made 50 million dollars notice he mentions it in dollars not ethereum not Bitcoin
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:41.580]   50 million dollars, but we're gonna do good things with it. I promise you
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:46.860]   I at this point I'm the other thing it gets me Leo is they also say like Gary says
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:53.940]   We're gonna have cartoons with this character like like just thinking of the coal the funny snail character is sufficient
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.940]   Wait, will you hear the Seth Green story?
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.780]   Wait, this is gonna end with a great story
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:03.780]   So at this conference vcon Minneapolis last weekend to educate
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.560]   I'm using from the Iraq at Minnesota
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.100]   calm educate
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:14.660]   Evangelize chill and convert people into true believers of NFTs
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:18.740]   Spike Lee for rel Williams Kevin Smith
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.780]   Mila Kunis evil angoria
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.180]   Seth Green
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.180]   Deepak Chopra
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.180]   Steven Ioki
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:35.780]   DJ Logan Paul video v YouTube star Liam Payne don't know who he is and Snoop Dogg
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:44.420]   6,000 token holders from around the world came to the 73,000 seat us bank stadium
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:49.540]   Tickets to the event
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:58.020]   You had to buy a V friends token crypto token which gets you into three years of V cons the average
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:03.500]   Still around average token price 7.76 ETH which is
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.420]   1496
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.580]   $1,490
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:13.460]   Is that is that now about $40 or well you never know that's the that's the problem
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:19.100]   Here's so let's talk about Seth Green as a
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.900]   poster child
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:28.460]   I really am gonna need to say something because the camera can't pick up me rolling my eyes okay, yeah just
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.260]   rolling eyes rolling eyes rolling eyes
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.540]   so Seth Green
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.540]   bought a board ape
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.940]   and
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:44.460]   Now that he is the owner of the board ape decided that he would like to make a board ape
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.860]   cartoon show
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.860]   Developed the show
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.860]   You know it was gonna I think premiere on
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:58.700]   Where was it some big network in a few months until
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:02.300]   His board ape got stolen
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:10.860]   Uh his forthcoming series white horse tabern incorporates actors characters from the actors extensive nft collection
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.740]   but a fishing scam
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:17.580]   Got him and the scammers stole his board ape
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.500]   Which means he lost his license to commercially adapt the monkey
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:26.780]   Though one actually could debate that as to whether or not owning the f at he was in fact
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:32.300]   Well, here's the fear because it was then sold on to somebody else board ape 83 98
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:37.740]   Purchased from the anonymous scanner by scammer by somebody called dark wing 84
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:40.940]   for $200,000
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:44.780]   Then transferred it to a collection called gbe vault
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:47.580]   Which happened like that
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.740]   Green has located dark wing 84 on twitter but has failed to make contact according to buzzfeed
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:55.580]   uh
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.220]   Here's the problem if the cartoon goes ahead
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.220]   board
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:05.900]   Dark wing 84 could sue Seth Green because technically he owns the copyright
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.740]   Well, but
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.820]   But counselor is that the case or not
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:14.940]   I rolls I rolls I rolls I rolls I rolls like
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:19.260]   There's so much going wrong here because this is not how it works
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:25.340]   And I know that like okay, obviously nft is a technology that didn't really exist and there's questions of how does existing law apply to it
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:30.540]   But a lot of people who have no particular expertise in how law normally work
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:35.500]   Are throwing it around and applying it in ways that I don't think it works
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:41.420]   You don't believe the Australian surgeon who goes by the name mr. Cheese
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.220]   You don't believe him
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.900]   Okay, I also didn't believe so Seth Green had a tweet that like for 18 years
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.780]   I've been studying copyright law in the business of law and entertainment. I'm like oh boy
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:59.420]   I mean, you know, I can't throw stones at all, you know non-lawyer
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.540]   Some people actually do develop very sophisticated understanding
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.780]   I look to Mike Masnick as somebody who's not aware but understands it really really well
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:12.940]   But one of the things you understand is like it depends is fundamentally very often the correct answer
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.700]   And if you think it actually comes out to very strongly one way or the other
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:23.660]   That is kind of a sign that you might be wrong because there's gonna be a countervailing argument for any argument you want to make
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:28.060]   I mean, but then again, some of them are just so specious that yeah, they are garbage
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:32.380]   Okay, so I'm looking at the board ap yacht club terms and conditions
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:38.620]   I mean, I don't know how I mean it's league is this legally binding? This is a contract under which you own
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.780]   your board ape
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.780]   Does it give you a venue? Does it get?
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.460]   a venue?
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.460]   Law, clause and that
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.700]   No, that's first I can tell
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:57.500]   I mean you have a mess anyway like this is a law school exam because you've got some contract which may or may not be binding
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.260]   You've got copyright
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.900]   You've got state law which tends to apply to contracts
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.660]   You have federal law that pre-em stuff which tends to apply to copyright
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:09.820]   And these parts don't even under the best days interact with each other very well
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.020]   And now all of a sudden you have an awful lot of people with some nefarious activity
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:20.300]   Possible theft but theft in a way that we might not actually be able to describe a stuff legally because it's ephemeral and not necessarily physical
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:26.620]   And which jurisdictions laws are going to be doing that describing and like the issue spotting is amusing like you know
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:32.940]   Me and my law friends could geek out on this and and you know have some you know lengthy conversations that are very interesting
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:37.100]   But to pretend that there's any sort of clear path of how this would all get resolved
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:42.220]   This is a that's not clear and that seems like a bad idea. So mr. Cheese
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.020]   the mr. Cheese the
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.060]   eponymous anonymous
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.340]   something miss
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.140]   Australian surgeon who owns the board ape
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.260]   now
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:52:00.620]   That particular board ape or yeah or ape or all the board a board a board a board a board a
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.980]   Looks like about four others. Yeah, well
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:11.260]   Make him a cartoon out of it. He says I have no plans for the ape. I have no plans for the ape mr. Cheese added
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.060]   As you can see I've been collecting for a while
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:21.180]   I bought it because I liked it. It wasn't achieved by either and it was not marked as suspicious. So I bought it in good faith
[00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:25.180]   I'm happy to be in contact with Seth to chat about this
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:32.940]   He spent $200,000. I think it'd be fair to give him a reasonable profit on his purchase
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.660]   Although he has been ignoring
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:40.620]   Seth's twitter appeals on treaties on treaties
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.460]   um
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:49.580]   I mean the concept of ownership is something that everyone just sort of relying on when it's not even clear what source of law would even
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:56.860]   Define ownership whose source of law would define ownership and what is the effect if somebody has purchased it who?
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:03.260]   Wasn't good faith was good faith. Um, you know, even the United States if you you know, you didn't know the thing was stolen
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:08.700]   But you bought it anyway, you may not be um criminally liable, but you might still have to give up the thing
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:15.580]   But that's less true in some other countries like it's not even clear whose law applies here. What law would apply here?
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:21.020]   I think this is basically just so lawless. This is just a very strange way to have
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:29.900]   Some sort of really significant economic activity writing on because most of the time economic activity is protected by just having some sort of rules of the road
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.780]   And it is not entirely clear what rules of the road are guiding every contract says where where were you?
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:38.140]   If we come to sue each other where in what jurisdiction will that be?
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:42.860]   And and and and so on the other thing gets me about this is that and I see there
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.860]   I forget some time ago
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:51.020]   Somebody wrote a post about how this is the ownership economy as if this is the the where it all goes
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:55.660]   I think it's the opposite. I think it's the last gasp of stupid copyright of the
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.860]   metaphor of property for creativity
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:04.060]   I think that's that's that's from statute of an until today and then I think it starts to die off
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:09.420]   Into something else. I've written about credit right about about chains of creativity
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.420]   There's a lot of ways we could talk about this, but this whole idea that everything gets owned
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.980]   Uh, and what you own is this?
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:22.940]   Creativity as a thing rather than an act and a product. I think is outmoded. I don't think this is gonna last
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.540]   Here is the uh, board ape in question
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:30.220]   Well, I can see why he is
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.980]   described as an ape in a skeleton t-shirt smoking a
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.620]   cigarette with a halo
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:40.860]   And that's not a cigarette leo. That's a funny cigarette. Don't know
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:48.540]   Background purple clothes bone teas eyes sad fur brown hat halo board on shaven
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:51.500]   Uh, here's the whole
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.220]   Because it's the blockchain. We know the entire
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:55:02.140]   You know history of the purchases and so forth. Uh, we know who owns it currently gbe vault, which is reported for suspicious activity
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:07.260]   Yeah, well, so open sea then if if there is something like this and this was not on it when he bought it
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.780]   But open sea once they heard about all this has has then
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.780]   Disabled purchase and selling of it and uh and has this
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:19.100]   Thing on it, which as you know now makes it all on the up and up
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:25.580]   So, uh, anyway, uh, you know, honestly it's hilarious. It's hilarious. I feel bad
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:31.420]   This is a dumb way of doing creativity. It's a dumb way to do economics and it's a dumb way of doing creativity
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:36.700]   This doesn't vindicate like this actually makes copyright look good and I would say that
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:43.180]   Yeah, you're you got a cafe. You're right. Yeah, this makes copyright look good
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:48.860]   Again, thanks to the blockchain. We know exactly who owns it
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:53.820]   We know exactly who transferred it. We know what they paid all of this is a is public
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:59.020]   Who is they you see stave ioke had it he get he sold it to seth green
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:01.980]   Seth green then was it was stolen from seth
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:07.580]   This is the knows the red exclamation mark. This account may be compromised to see a
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:11.580]   A0 9 o who then sold it to dark wing
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:15.420]   immediately by the way
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:19.980]   And dark wing immediately transferred it into the gbe vault
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.100]   Uh, that's where that's dr. Cheese
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:27.020]   That's dr. Cheese by the way, she is not like
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:33.100]   Some new age chai energy coming up your spine is cheese. It's from agus
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.780]   It's a nice piece of of monster
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:42.700]   So i'll be disappointed if somebody doesn't write a book about this and call it the apes of wrath apes of rath
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.260]   Oh
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:46.780]   Oh
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:48.940]   So what is how much is 106?
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:53.740]   Uh, eth i guess yes, i guess it's 200 000
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:57:00.300]   At some point i guess at the point of sale and then don't forget the gas fees which also have to be added on
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:06.780]   But the look here 41 maybe should have bought 4175 i could buy it now for 150 eth
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:11.180]   You know what's sad is somebody somebody drew this
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.540]   They're getting no money for it. They got paid, you know 50 bucks in a or whatever and that's that
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.500]   Uh
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.500]   It's just so stupid
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:24.300]   So we are hit we have hit the i mean there's
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.500]   Brian is who has sort of
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:33.100]   Looked into some of the artistic merits of the zen of t-thing and he's written some very
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.540]   Interesting defenses of how this might actually further
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:42.380]   artistic creativity and funding and sort of actually put copyright law to shame as it deserves
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:43.740]   regularly
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:47.900]   But and i can accept a lot of the arguments that he has but that's not what's happening
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:54.300]   That's not what's getting vindicated. This is a weird gold rush mentality rent seeking pyramids games griff
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.900]   This is this isn't vindicating anything of value
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:03.580]   Um, and it's just neither an economic nor a legal construct that solves an existing problem
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:09.900]   It just seems to create a whole bunch of new ones. So i'm never a fan of my attitude is if you want to support artists give them some money
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:12.940]   You don't have to do you don't have to do this all bs
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.820]   thing
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:20.540]   Um, oh, hey, by the way, this is going to be interesting
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:24.860]   Uh, this is just in from the san francisco chronicle right after the
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.860]   horrific
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:31.420]   Events in of all the texas yesterday the california senate passed a gun control bill
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:33.820]   Modeled on the texas abortion law
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:40.140]   So now mike maznik already said not a good idea private citizens can file suit
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:44.140]   That's not a way to do policy is my said no, it's terrible
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:47.820]   It's bad in texas. It's bad in california
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:50.540]   But you know it's kind of hard to resist
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:58.220]   Right. Well the only thing so since I have no control over this and it's on its own trajectory
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:05.340]   This points this helps illustrate the tremendous damage that the shadow docket on sb8
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:10.140]   Had because it it puts states in a position where they can do this sort of thing
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:15.500]   Which isn't the way our federal union was supposed to work and that one thing of like yeah go ahead
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:20.700]   Let sb8 go ahead. There's no problems here. This is exactly the sort of problem attempted and
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.620]   You know way as a single example. I don't necessarily mind it as
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:30.540]   Something hopefully salient enough that can nip this trend in a bond because otherwise I think we have
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:38.700]   Fundamental problems about how we're going to stay together as a country because this really is so corrosive on the bonds that hold the states together. Yes
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:46.540]   Uh, I presume this will immediately be I mean, it's you know, it's obviously unconstitutional just the texas law is oh, but wait
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:51.020]   There you go
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.660]   Never mind
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:59.740]   Let's let's however if I can jump in with other stupid that's come from the california legislature or that's working
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:02.300]   It's way through the california legislature like we've already
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:08.380]   Spurned the red states and they're stupid ideas of how they want to regulate the internet, but california's got some too
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:14.940]   Um, they're floating a bill about creating a private rate of action against platforms for
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:21.820]   Something alleged to be called like that kids get addicted to social media, which is a highly highly
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.180]   Spacious thing not supported by social science
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:32.460]   So it's questionable that there's actually a legitimate problem to solve and the way that there is a pending bill to solve it is
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:42.380]   Rather game over for a lot of platforms because it would really just sort of just open them up to unending litigation from everybody who who has
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:49.180]   Really just no particular claim at all but can float a lawsuit to go try to extract settlement money from it
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.940]   This has gone through the legislature, but it's now at the senate
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.820]   And I want to highlight that because the senate really needs to put the brakes on this
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.940]   This is not something that's good and it's just because we've got but think of the children attached to it
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:08.780]   Nobody's putting the appropriate thought into what the full implications of this policy proposal is a
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:13.980]   24-8 the social media platform that my new day to children act
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.580]   Introduced by democrat buffie wicks of oakland
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.780]   With republican jordan cunning hamapassel roblestone support believe it or not from the uc
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:27.580]   San diego school of law children's advocacy institute
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:34.300]   Uh, and it allows and it's a tricky one to fight. This isn't something that children
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.940]   Have it the social science does not support the claim that there is a problem
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.060]   Or that this would be the solution to any problem that there might actually be
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:42.540]   um
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:48.060]   This is kind of the the moral panics that come up every so often that the rock lyrics are too violent
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.660]   The video games are too violent. It's as untethered to
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:55.340]   social science as any of those things
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:01.580]   Snap
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.660]   Oh snap the do's oh snap
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.380]   snap sends shiver
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:11.420]   Through ad stocks we're talking about you said a singular shiver a single shiver
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.380]   Has been said this is martin piers writing in the
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.860]   single
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.860]   Shiver
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.300]   single shiver
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.300]   uh snap stock down
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.500]   um
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:29.820]   It says 30 percent. I think it was even more than that initially it was 40. Yeah, it was it was almost half of its value gone
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.460]   uh because it said oh, yeah
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:33.580]   uh
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:39.340]   adds adds her second quarter revenue and profits will be below what we projected a few weeks ago
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.900]   Thanks to a faster than expected
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:46.220]   Deterioration in macro economic conditions
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:49.340]   Nobody was buying ads
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:56.860]   They allude to supply chain problems and a friend of mine tweeted like
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:02.140]   What's what's the breakdown in a supply chain or eyeballs? No, what is it? What is it?
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.780]   No, I can I can I can address that stupid glasses
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:10.620]   We see the same thing which companies are reluctant to buy ads if they can't sell products that are being advertised
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.700]   And so if there's a supply chain
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:18.060]   Problem those it's a it's it's a add a follow-on effect from supply chain. Oh
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:25.340]   Okay, well their their message was not clear that they were they were having ancillary effects to other people supply chain problem
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:31.420]   Problems the way they articulated it sounded like they had a supply chain there is no lack of ads on snap if you need one
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.780]   We've got a glut apparently
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.860]   Okay, okay, so
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:44.140]   Yeah, I know you know I pay attention to this stuff when I see something like that
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:48.220]   It sends a shiver down my spine because of course we also sell ads
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.780]   But we haven't seen the same drop off
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.740]   by knock knock on
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:59.900]   Wood but that's why we have club twit, you know to kind of smooth out the the shiver
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:05.180]   Uh, effect why don't I do an ad right now? We got a great panel. Kathy gellis is with us
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:09.260]   She writes at tech dirt also has a law practice at cg

[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:40.300]   indyweb.org is the site he likes to promote because we all want an independent

[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:49.580]   You know, it's really been interesting kevin to watch mastodon take off after all of this twitter upset

[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:33.580]   You're stuck with him insulting your shirt no matter what it's so white shirt. I'm wearing actually it's a bit of history
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.580]   This is a zd television
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.300]   shirt, which goes back to the early 90s
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:43.420]   when zif davis who is no longer but was at one time a well-known publisher of
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:47.820]   magazine, especially computer magazines pc magazine computer shopper
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:51.580]   and the like uh said we should be in television
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.500]   and uh
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.460]   And they they they gave me a polo shirt and said
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.140]   You're in it. You're in you're on right now go
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.260]   Uh polo shirt that by the way, you cannot wear
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:07.260]   On tv oddly enough, but they were new to it. They didn't know
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.740]   They didn't know it's too bright
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:12.140]   Our show today bro. Hey, let me tell you i'm feeling good today
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:17.020]   I am feeling really good today and I can credit it to my eight sleep fact even this morning lisa said
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:22.460]   Wow, you were out last night went to bed early stayed in bed till eight 30. I said yep
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.820]   It was just too comfortable to leave eight sleep
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:30.300]   Make something we we have on our mattress called the pod
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.060]   pro
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.340]   cover
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:39.820]   That has really transformed the quality of my sleep, you know 30 percent american struggle with sleep
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:44.140]   Uh, and one of the main reasons is temperature too hot too cold
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:50.380]   Good sleep is so important for health so important for state of mind your heart your blood pressure
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:53.980]   Even good sleep can even reduce the risk of alzheimer's
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.180]   Why are we having such trouble sleeping? Well, I think
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:03.820]   Especially, you know in the summertime it's too hot winter time. It's too cold eight sleep is an amazing
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.660]   cover
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:06.700]   that
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.700]   checks your uh
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:15.900]   Biometrics while you're sleeping and the temperature of the room and then adjust the temperature of the bed and man when I say adjust
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:21.020]   It can adjust it as low as 55 degrees or as hot as 110
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.220]   That's that's pretty warm and that's pretty cold
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:28.300]   What's nice and it doesn't actually it doesn't swing that much most of the time
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:32.700]   What I do is I set it to be a little toasty when I get in bed it cools off at night
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:35.100]   Which helps me get into that deep sleep cycle
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.980]   Your body really wants it to be cool for that
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:41.020]   And then I uh to wake me up instead of an alarm clock
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:46.220]   I just have it go up a little bit and i'm toasty and I wake up and I go ready for the day
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:51.980]   eight sleep users fall asleep 32 percent faster and reduce sleep interruptions
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.620]   by 40 percent
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:57.180]   And overall get a more restful sleep and they know that
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.140]   Because they've got the biometrics to prove it
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:03.660]   Good sleep is the ultimate game changer natures
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:11.180]   Gentle nurse and I love mike pod cover you got to get at the pod pro cover from eight sleep

[01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:58.940]   Lisa
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.300]   See there is a out of you know, there's an automatic kind of sleep doctor thing
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:07.100]   And she turned it off and she said no i'm gonna do it and she said it too cool last night
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.300]   And she was she woke up. She said I was freezing
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:15.260]   So she did not have a good night's sleep. Let the eight sleep choose
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:21.580]   Don't don't override it, but you do have different sides. It didn't bother me at all. You have two two different people
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:27.340]   Uh each side of the bed based on based on your sleep stages your biometrics and the bedroom

[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.660]   Probably
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.340]   I mean, it's pretty old
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:53.820]   No, I don't think it's moths. I think it's the mic eclipse kind of poked it in there. I don't know
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:58.380]   Somebody says the mic lips. You're right. It does have holes, but I still want to know where it just is
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:03.260]   You know a bit of memorabilia. Yeah, and then i'm gonna send it to christina christina warren
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:06.540]   Gilex failed companies t-shirts
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.860]   *laughter*
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:12.860]   All right, let's let's move along
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:22.380]   Big tech is getting clobbered on wall street and the new york times is on it the new york time says it's good for them
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.860]   I'm sorry. It's a good time for them
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:27.020]   what?
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:30.940]   flush with cash facebook facebook apple amazon microsoft and ghoul
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:37.180]   Are positioned to emerge from a downturn stronger and more powerful trip muckle
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:39.340]   writing this
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:43.900]   For the new york times. He's of course the guy wrote after steve. I interviewed him a couple of weeks ago about that book
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.580]   He said they've lost 2.7 trillion dollars
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:51.500]   In value my eff you money is saying eff you
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:55.020]   Now I didn't invest directly in these companies
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.380]   I invested in the scp 500 which I have since learned
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.900]   Is heavily invested in apple amazon microsoft facebook and google so
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:07.740]   They lost
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:10.940]   What would be the equivalent of the annual gross domestic product of britain?
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:14.780]   This year since january
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:17.740]   Um
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:21.500]   But but it's lost about 10 percent of that as well. Yeah, that's right. Yeah
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:25.740]   So but trip says it's a good thing
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.700]   He says and he's quoting actually analysts who say
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:41.100]   Large companies drops in prices 58 for peloton uber down 45
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.380]   Job cuts layoffs
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:47.100]   um, but
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:50.620]   A little belt tightening is good during the great recession
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:56.140]   Facebook amazon google apple and microsoft required more than 100 companies because they were
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:01.020]   cheap but now they're not going to be allowed to buy companies because of antitrust. Oh
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:05.020]   Mmm
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.620]   Um, I guess that's the the
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.900]   Total upshot of it, right?
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:15.180]   They can buy stuff now. I guess it's cheap
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:18.780]   Anyway, uh, let's see what else
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:22.540]   Jack dorsey has now officially left the building
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.060]   You knew that when he's not alone. Oh
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.020]   Others who stepped down
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:31.020]   That's the next line
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.020]   Uh, very interesting
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.820]   Twitter shareholders vote to kick
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.340]   silver lake off the board
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:43.100]   Uh, and what's interesting is he gone durbin
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.620]   Who is now resigning from the board is a long time musk
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.420]   backer a business associate
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:52.700]   Who uh supported musk's acquisition of twitter
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.500]   So the shareholders that's an interesting
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.460]   Signal from the shareholders. They have to approve any deal from musk. Why are they kicking?
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.500]   Silver lake off
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.900]   The shareholders don't like musk. You think it really is a vote against musk
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:13.340]   That's what I thought is. Mm. I don't know. Mm. Mm
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:16.140]   Uh
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:21.260]   Is it showers being taken that way? Well, this has happened. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Uh, yeah, so
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.340]   It's durbin through silver lake
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:30.220]   Uh, poured a hundred million dollars into solar city before it was acquired by tesla
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:37.900]   Uh, when musk remember famously said that tesla is going to go private. He was working with silver lake as a financial advisor
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:45.500]   both men uh serve on a entertainment board of an entertainment company called endeavor aria manuals company
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:49.100]   So yeah, maybe this is a little
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.700]   Little sub tweet signal. Yeah a little sub tweet from the
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.620]   Shareholders
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:14:00.300]   We don't like this deal. Although what is twitter's stock at? I mean at this point you're getting a hell of a deal
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:05.180]   Elon offered 50 240. I'm sorry 5420
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:12.540]   The stock is at 37 16 some things are more important than stock like the democracy, but it's back up because
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.260]   musk is getting more money
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:17.100]   Oh
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:22.060]   Yeah, I think some of this some of this was a vote that musk would not get his bid would not be
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:27.500]   Uh, supported and so they weren't going to get the 5420 in other words stock market didn't believe it
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:30.460]   But now and there has been a little bump today
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:36.140]   Um musk says he's got to get 44 million total
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:40.220]   Uh, he's got 33 and a half million
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:44.700]   He should put you know he should do his put a little thermometer on the lawn at tesla
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:49.820]   That just shows how close he is to raising next to it is the stock price
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:59.900]   Uh, this team is odd because he's very extended in terms of his tesla stock and the tesla stock is dropping
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:04.860]   So his ability to convert what he owns in tesla seems I don't know this
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:13.340]   It it doesn't seem like it makes sense to follow each little like jump because I don't think we know enough to know how this is happening
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:18.460]   But I I feel like I've seen more stuff saying to suggest that this is going to fall apart
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:25.020]   Then I've seen stuff to say that everything is fine and it's going to the deal is going to be consummated the way it was articulated originally
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.820]   Uh
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:33.420]   Are you sad jeff because I know uh, you really think twitter is all that and obviously
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:38.940]   This is not good for twitter whatever happens and if musk gets a hold of it it'd probably even be worse
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:41.500]   Are you sad? Is that a loss?
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.660]   Yeah, it really is
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:48.060]   But I think it you know, I go back to jack's tweet
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:54.860]   Uh a few weeks ago where he said that the centralizing discovery and identity in corporations was wrong
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:59.180]   And I I think that's what we're seeing here and in fact
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:06.060]   And so i'm gonna i'm trying to reach out to to blue sky because i'm i remain fascinated in that and there's two other interesting things
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.940]   This is where this is my stories for kevin discussion too
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.060]   um, adam usari
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.860]   from
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:18.460]   Head of instagram did a ted talk and normally I don't quote ted talks
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:22.940]   But which he was arguing and it's a fairly obvious that he was arguing that that
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.580]   blockchain will enable
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.100]   creators
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:33.100]   On any platform to have a direct relationship. This is what he's advocating direct relationship with their fans
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:36.380]   They're subscribers their purchasers. They're called them what you will they're people
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.060]   and
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.140]   Um, so what he's talking about there is a shift protocol what?
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.820]   um
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:47.660]   Blue sky is a shift from company to protocol even open sea
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.900]   uh, which was
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:56.300]   Criticized for still being a centralized point in the supposedly distributed world of nft's is distributing now
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:03.740]   Talking about a protocol and so I wonder whether we are potentially entering a new phase of the net where twitter may be
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:06.380]   a sacrificial lamb
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:07.980]   to the ills
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.980]   Of centralized ownership
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:16.860]   Uh and showing this why we really don't want that and we really want to return to a world of hctps and email protocols and so on
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:21.740]   So forth where we have a more open world now
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:24.940]   I'm sure kevin can poke holes in that little bit of optimism of mine
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:30.140]   But i'm hoping that this is this is what we see coming so yes, i'm very sad about twitter
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:35.500]   I think it it's part of the public conversation. It's a place where I have tons of friends get tons of information
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:41.020]   I spend a lot of time and I enjoy it and I fear maybe it's not going to go down and and
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:47.500]   Andre Brock the the great author of distributed blackness has said we're going to stay and we're going to fight and other people are too
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:52.780]   And maybe we could still do that, but it just feels like we got kudy's even being around musk
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:57.260]   Okay, there's a couple things there so um
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:03.020]   Yes, but it goes the right thing. I'm a big fan of protocols. I you know, I'm I'm advocate for those
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:07.660]   but there's a pernicious thing now which is been pushed by um
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:11.100]   um a 16z and
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:15.180]   A bunch of other people where they're saying we're gonna make new protocols and there's gonna be money in them
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.100]   And that's gonna be better and actually that's gonna make them worse
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.220]   We spent a long time getting money out of protocols
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:25.660]   The patterns that were blocking us are actually doing interrupt in audio and video for 20 years
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:31.260]   But we basically had to wait for them to expire before we could do interop again because the the thickets were so thick in that
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.020]   rules and we spent a long time actually reconstructing the sort of
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:41.180]   Social order of technology so that we we work on an open source basis on a different protocol basis
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:48.620]   Now most of the time and they're trying to turn the clock back to the kind of patent pool nonsense that dog does in the in the 90s
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.060]   so
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.060]   That's that's I think that's antithesis of
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:57.980]   What you want when you're trying to how does talk explain to me a little more Kevin if you were the money in protocol
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:02.300]   But he out of protocol. What is this? This is the the Chris Dixon web three thesis
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:06.460]   Um, so Chris Dixon is he's going around saying web three, which is not the web
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:11.580]   And the web does his version numbers, but he's saying we can have this great idea where you have a protocol and you and
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:16.460]   Um, it's lucrative to create protocols because you will get paid every time and someone uses your protocol
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:23.180]   We should mention that be a huge a huge mark for protocols and is is a venture capitalist at
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:30.060]   Andresen Horowitz and and they are in fact the owners in effect web three go ahead
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.780]   Yes, yeah
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:35.820]   Well, web three was made up by um Gavin what's his face?
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:45.180]   but um in 2014 but yeah Chris Dixon has been has been hyping it strongly and but his his his supposed investment thesis is we can create protocols that
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:50.460]   That flow value by attaching tokens to protocols, which means they don't end up into a program at all
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:54.540]   You end up having a bunch of protocols that uh each got separate tokens
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:59.500]   And then he can he can sort of pump and dump those and push them out to coinbase and then make another one
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:04.940]   So it's you know, it's a non-starter. It's not a good way to do protocols the way you do protocols is very hard and complicated
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:07.420]   Where you actually sit down and have to agree with people how to do things
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:12.540]   This is the opposite. I don't agree with you. I'll just make a token and do what I want
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.420]   Yeah, so it's you know having spent
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:22.140]   A large chunk of my time doing protocol stuff. It's it's not about we've had a brilliant idea and we've written it down
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:26.700]   Everyone adopted there people seem to think that it's like basically I've said it's a protocol
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:32.140]   It's not legislation protocols documentation. They say um here's how to do things
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:35.740]   If you want to work on the set if you want to move data between these two things
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:39.660]   Here's how you do it and his his rules the trouble is we write it like legislation
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:43.580]   So if you actually read them they say you must do this and you shall do that and
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.140]   you may do the other and
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.380]   It's written in that form. Um, and so
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:54.860]   After people have done that a bit they think oh, so if I can change the protocol that everyone will then change the world and that would that would do things
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:59.500]   And that's when your standards body gets bogged down in politics. You have to throw it away and start a new standards body
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:04.140]   Um, what do you think about a blue sky in that in that context? Um
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:09.980]   Blue sky. I mean blue sky. I like some of the people involved. I talked to them
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:12.380]   um, but
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:17.500]   They seem to they've they've they've been valuing originality over utility
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:21.740]   They said we want to do something new and different and we said well here's how you do it with existing protocols look
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:24.540]   We've been doing for 10 years and they're oh, but that's not new enough. It's like
[01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:29.020]   Yes, that's the point the point is that we know how to do interop
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:31.820]   Twitter like interop with existing protocols
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:37.340]   That's what example indy web is about we've we've we've built six or seven different protocols
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:39.100]   and we've
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:43.820]   Simplified some existing ones. We've got them through w3c. We know a whole bunch of work on this
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.060]   You're getting people to adopt them and so on
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:51.500]   Um, but they're saying well, we really don't want to use dns. We wouldn't we don't want to use
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:57.420]   dns and url so we're gonna make up some new signature thing that's that's based on um
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:02.540]   Cryptography, which you know, you can sort of argue for that, but actually it's really annoying
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:07.580]   Um, you you end up with things that aren't names you end up with things that are like long strings of hex digits
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:10.220]   which is one of the sort of nightmares of all the
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:12.780]   uh
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:16.300]   NFTs and bick coinery is your you've got two magic long hex strings
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:19.900]   And you're supposed to give someone one or not the other and if you're giving the other one then they take your you apes
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.220]   you know, there's there's a there's a
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:28.460]   We have a way to do distributed namespaces across the internet. It's called dns. It's works very well
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:35.260]   There was a time where we had to put some political structure in place to deal with it, which is iCan we have that now
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.860]   Um, and making new ones is not actually enormously helpful
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:46.140]   Twitter twitter got away with it very new namespace, but basically their namespaces put twitter.com before this and then you've got the name
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.220]   um
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:53.180]   And they've hit the problem that they're running out of them now so all the new names have got six digits half of them as well
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:54.860]   um, so
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:58.060]   We you know, but they dress very nicely all of those people. Yes
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:05.020]   Yeah, but you know you you you remember jeff we we we linked to each other on blogs. It isn't actually harder. Link someone's blog
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:09.260]   Yeah, um, or even their post but you can link to their name into the blog and that works
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:12.060]   And we've got protocols now that when I link to your blog
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:15.740]   It can I can it my blog can tell you i've linked to it and you can
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:19.340]   Um, take what i've done and add it onto the end. You know how to do that
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:22.380]   We're working with different groups to adopt more of it
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:29.340]   But it's you know, the challenge is not the protocols the challenge is people trying not to interoperate
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:33.100]   You know, I had this is this is exactly the problem I had with open social
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:38.780]   14 years ago over it was where we we did the work to get things to work interoperate
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.980]   And then everyone said actually we'd rather not interoperate. We want to own everything
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:48.060]   Um, you know facebook did it first and then google said, yeah, no, we want to do that too, which is why i didn't work there afterwards
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:49.260]   um
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.260]   And you know, now nobody owns anything
[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:58.700]   Well, so you agree with chris's second point which is that the current web is is basically run by corporations and the value
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.180]   No, I think we're that at all. I think the web is fine
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.300]   I think the the structure of corporations is a problem
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:08.140]   But the way you you don't fix that by more financialization and nonsense, right?
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:14.860]   Right, we already have systems that are democrat democratized that work perfectly well
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:21.580]   You fix it by finding a group of people who actually want to interoperate again and working with them and talking to them and it's in its
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:28.540]   Trying web.org so that system you talked about is web mention, right? Yes, so that
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:32.780]   That's one of the pieces of it. Yeah, but the the specific one of
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:37.260]   Um to build a sort of distributed to like at reply thing is web mention
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:41.980]   So if I if um jeff writes a post and I reply to it
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:47.020]   I can web mention him and it can appear under his his post if he has web mentions supporting software
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:52.140]   Right and and vice-versa he can reply to me and we've got we got the infrastructure for doing that
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:54.780]   How do we get people to use this?
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:58.140]   Um, do you get them to?
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.580]   well
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.980]   Use something that supports it micro blog supports it
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.500]   Um
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:07.340]   We're working on getting other people's food. We've taught having an interesting conversation in tumblr this week
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:08.380]   Um
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:14.060]   Where we're trying to get tumblr to support indie web stuff and we're getting strong support from matt running wag and the c oo of
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:20.860]   Tumblr to do some work to matt's fantastic. I have to say there's a there's a guy who's a champion of open
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:22.620]   No, yeah matt
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:26.140]   That's great and if we can get on tumblr great and then we can maybe get on WordPress too
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:32.060]   And then we've got like half the web. Yeah, literally matt mala wig is the creator of uh word pro
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:36.140]   Oh, tumblr. Yeah, that's well
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:40.300]   You've definitely sent me off it here. Um, good. Keep going
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:45.180]   You're probably twitter is exactly the problem you said it's like it's the place where your your news buddies are
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:50.620]   Um, which is why it's great. It's one of why I like it. There's there's there's a bunch of other parallel tours that go on
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:54.460]   But the the global journalist twitter is an important part of twitter
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:56.060]   um
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:56.940]   and
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:59.500]   the challenge is it's the same challenge that um
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:03.660]   We had they what we had with google reader
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:08.700]   And with facebook's news products is the problem is news is news and ad businesses
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:15.100]   Don't really go very well together, especially all made of that business is because running ads against news is
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:19.740]   Is a tricky business at the best of times but also people don't want the
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:22.380]   The classic thing of you don't want
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:23.820]   um
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:28.220]   Plain and plain to get adverts next to plane crashes, but the machine will provide that for you if you're not very careful
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:33.820]   Um, so the um, it sort of gets naturally rejected by these ad supported businesses
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:40.540]   Um, so you know the reason reader didn't last was they're like well, this there's there's google was like there aren't enough people using it
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:44.300]   It's like the people who are using it are using it like 1600 times a day
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:48.140]   Um, and they're the people who actually want use it because they're the ones who were writing about your
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.020]   About your products, but they didn't quite get that
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:55.260]   Um, and it's not quite a little conversation. It's fairly close to the conversation
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:59.340]   Um, and twitter has the same problem. It's like the journalists love it
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:03.980]   And they like the attraction of that part of it, but in terms of ads that isn't
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:08.300]   That isn't the where they they're making the money out. Yeah, and technorati was that too
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.220]   We had that same problem as we built that tool for
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:15.180]   That was primarily for journalists in news and we had the continuous problem of like how do we make money from this?
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:19.580]   Because that doesn't correlate well with advertising. There was a wonderful tool. Oh, it was great
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:25.500]   I miss technorati. I really do. Yeah, but you know, but yeah, we can build a distributed technorati with this stuff
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:29.900]   If we want to yeah, or but it's centralized well if we really want to again, but i'm not sure i want to take that on again
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:32.940]   But the other half is you spend a lot of time dealing with spam
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:34.620]   um
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:39.260]   Anyway, so that's a problem everywhere. Isn't it? Yeah, so so the so the
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.300]   there's the sort of
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.820]   the problem of
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:48.860]   Do we have interrupting protocols? Yes, we do we've got only videotropping protocols and we've got layers of them
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:51.500]   And we've got choices at lots of the different layers
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:56.540]   Um, we can we can do this stuff, but it takes some will to actually want to interoperate
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:59.340]   Um, and then the other problem is
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:05.900]   There is a tension between ads supported and news and it's not something that's that's that's trivially solvable
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:08.220]   And you see, you know, it's a problem for new sites as well. The other the
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:11.980]   Cororif that is that the the the
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:19.180]   News that's good and has had time spent on it is now behind paywalls and the propaganda isn't
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.660]   And that's that's the other thing that eats weird as well
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.700]   exactly
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:26.700]   So yeah, there's a there's a
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:28.700]   one thing that gets back
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.700]   So sorry heavy
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:37.100]   Oh, well, so one thing that gets back to the 11th circuit and the first amendment down in the florida social media law is
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.460]   Stuff having to do with we talked a little bit about like well if
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:48.220]   Why is the rule different that the bar could kick out the person that they didn't want to serve but not the platform and the argument being thrown into that?
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.780]   Is that these platforms are so integral to how?
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.780]   um society
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:57.740]   You know you need to be there because everybody else is there so if you want to have your life function you better be on facebook
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:02.460]   Which I think is a species notion, but they're obviously big and have very heavy presences
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:05.580]   And so that's been the argument for
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:10.620]   Lutir ability to parse out who they let on their platforms or not
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:16.620]   But the thing is you could in theory get another you could get another facebook
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:25.260]   You can get a www.not facebook.com you can get a www.not twitter.com that in theory you can get an infinite number of other
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:33.740]   platforms to either facilitate messages or if you want roll your own so you can have your own website and you can point out your own message
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:36.060]   And the more that we rely on protocols
[01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:41.500]   Instead of the companies then when you put your message up so it's on the web in a certain way
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:46.700]   Other people will be able to interact with it and we don't need the proprietary methods to be able to do that
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:53.820]   But then to back up the concern that I have a little bit is what are the obstacles to being able to roll your own?
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:57.180]   Have your own web server have your own mail server have your own
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:00.300]   You know and email server
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:03.180]   What are the regulatory obstacles?
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:08.540]   So for instance, we better keep section 230 because that keeps the regulatory obstacles at a minimum
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.060]   But then we have privacy regulation sprouting up all over the place
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:16.940]   So, you know, if you want to start your own fan forum for instance, it's a much harder
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:21.820]   Decision to make a more expensive decision to make than it used to be but it's still
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:25.500]   Makeable and then what are the practical considerations?
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:31.180]   It's going to need some technical support. It's going to be some maintenance now cyber security is a big thing
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:33.580]   So how do we support it so that?
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:35.660]   Functionally
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:41.900]   Provide their own independent outlets and then the protocols can make sure that we get the functionality and interconnectivity between the internet outlets
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:49.100]   Um, so you know as a lawyer, I want to care about do we have the regulatory space that is making it so we can get another
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:54.940]   We can get another facebook or we can even just get your own platform where you're put out your own message that other people can interact with
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.940]   And you don't even need another
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:00.780]   Platform necessarily and certainly not run one run by a corporation
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:09.500]   So from my perspective I on the ball of what does it take to diminish the barriers so that we don't need to use these companies because
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:12.940]   We can get what we need there's something we get from them
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:18.060]   But we could probably get all those benefits in another way that does not require giving
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.900]   You know up our privacy and that's not the other thing in order to have accounts on facebook
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:26.460]   There's other ways that we can speak to each other online. We were doing that before facebook
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:29.020]   Let's figure out if we can do that after facebook as well
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.620]   Yeah, and they do so the exact regulation
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.580]   Yeah, but the regulation is really a factor
[01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:37.660]   Yeah
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:41.020]   But you know, but we're pressed all studies is WordPress is still a very large portion of the web
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:43.900]   You know blog is still exists. You can go and use that and and
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:48.860]   You know tumblr too. There's there's a whole bunch of places you can go and publish your stuff online and talk about things and
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:53.100]   There are many master instances and so on as well. Um, it's more that
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:56.860]   The challenge is is the group of people I want to talk to there
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:02.780]   And then you have to do the work to to cross post things to to publish on one place and then say and then share it somewhere else
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:04.140]   Defeat stuff back and again
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.580]   We've got tools to help do that and things to make that a little easier
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.420]   But it's still work and still takes them setting up
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:13.100]   And and then the other half of that is you necessarily want to make them all together
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:17.740]   You know, you don't necessarily want every twitter reply to show up on your blog post like that could be annoying too
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:20.780]   Because the way twitter replies have with you know
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:25.580]   Both thundering heard problems and pylons and things you necessarily want them all turning up
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:32.140]   On your own site. You want not want to keep that cleaner. So there's there's some there's some tensions. There's always intentions between
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:34.220]   um
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:41.340]   My post has taken off. Oh great. Oh, my post has taken off now. I've got a go and move house. You know, there's um, which which is a which is a real problem
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:46.700]   Uh, let's see
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:51.420]   You want you want a happy tiktok moment? No, but okay. I'll do it
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:59.100]   Yes a happy tiktok moment you defling crypto boy is so much. Yeah, which one of the uh of the list
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.820]   Well, there's just two moments
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:09.020]   So at a lap would who i've talked about before is a young woman who is at kambridge. She heads the organ one of the colleges there
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.260]   She she directs a chorus
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.900]   Uh, and she goes and she's a
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:16.300]   Stat kind of a staff organist at royal labard hall
[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:21.740]   So she goes in and she she has to go in the middle of the night to practice and she's there and
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:25.820]   You play this one. I don't know why it's other than you
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:29.100]   Oh, shit. How come I can't play it?
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:35.180]   There we go. I really don't give you play a concert feels tricky really like oh, that's right. That was a one with her. All right, so so
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:37.020]   Keep going
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:40.300]   This was a concert for bonobo. Did I say that right? Yes
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:45.340]   They saw they heard her she was playing a couple hours notice and they heard her and they said oh
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:50.700]   We have to have you they wrote apart for her and he did she did a five-day engagement with him
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:54.140]   Wowing the audience when this organ just
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:58.860]   People didn't know there was an organ in royal helpard hall was there, but they know
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:02.860]   He can't miss it
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:06.700]   But it was kind of a wonderful woman and I think she's the greatest
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:11.340]   She's she's a young woman who's who's in the all best senses are a sense of the word of nerd
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:14.620]   She's a pipe organ nerd, but she just has this
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:20.460]   Enthusiasm about it that's infectious. So I thought it was a nice happy moment. That's one
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:26.940]   The other one is Ukrainian soldiers singing a tribute to their drones. They love their drones
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:30.460]   And here they are singing a tribute
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:37.580]   With full orchestra apparently
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:43.020]   The vaters have come to mother Ukraine with new ammunition and
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:45.980]   But all the nice gears now burning like tar
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:49.980]   Biractar, which is the Turkish drone
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:55.660]   That they love
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:00.460]   Russians have parked their tanks in the bushes to munch on killbasa they stole from babushka
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:05.340]   Before they could say suka bla at they're hit hard by biractar
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:12.620]   I don't know if I should really we should be really celebrating this, but I kind of understand their
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:14.620]   Joy
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:17.900]   They're dragging us back to their evil empire bad move on their part
[01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:21.900]   We won't let them bring back the USSR by that thought
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:26.460]   Why is victor orban selling
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:34.300]   Birek tar to the Ukrainians is my question nadon. Yeah, I thought it was
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:42.140]   I feel like turkey is kind of I don't know on the fence. No are they yet? No wait orban or erdogem
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:46.700]   Erdogem. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's what could be okay, right? Um
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:52.940]   Well good market. I confuse hungry and turkey. Sorry
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:58.460]   Uh, yeah, um
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:01.660]   Yeah
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:04.700]   That's hysterical. Okay. Thank you tiktok
[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:09.500]   I guess I could play that there's not the Ukrainian army is not going to come after me with a
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:16.300]   Strike on youtube they might come out after you with a drone not with a takedown order. Yeah, they do strikes in a different way
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:19.740]   It's a different kind of copyright strike
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:25.020]   I think the Ukrainian government is very happy to have this their content share at the moment
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.420]   Maybe they've been a line with this stuff. Yeah
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:33.260]   They're they're they're wonderful young guy who's their their head of digital transition
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:34.700]   Left
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:39.020]   Keve and went to Davos and scolded companies like sas
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:41.660]   To get the heck out of russia
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:46.460]   And say your companies are not doing enough which I like seeing when they go to to Davos, especially since i'm not invited
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:51.660]   You didn't get to go. I'm sorry. Oh, and Thomas protocol will join us on sunday to give us the Davos
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:56.380]   Report which used to be used to have from jeff. Yeah, sorry
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:00.620]   Um
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:09.420]   I this was actually I thought kind of an upbeat story. Let me see if I can find it they uh
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:12.620]   They uh have created
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:14.780]   students
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:18.780]   At the researchers at the university of texas at austin
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:24.140]   Have created a gel film that can pull gallons of drinking water
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:27.260]   per day from the air
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:29.900]   Even the very dry desert air
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:34.780]   It's cheap to make it's uh, it's basically cellulose
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:39.740]   with a common food additive couple of bucks to make per kilogram
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:41.900]   and uh
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:43.020]   the
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:49.820]   At 30 humility humidity it can produce 3.4 gallons of water per day per kilogram of gel
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:53.580]   Even at the very low desert humidity of 15
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:57.580]   It can produce 1.6 gallons of fresh water a day
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:04.860]   Per kilogram so the gel absorbs the moisture from the air and then if it's heated mildly releases it
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:09.180]   It's really I thought was a great story. Isn't that amazing?
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.460]   It's a cellulose and conjiac gum
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.340]   Which is widely used in food additives?
[01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:20.780]   So it is uh, yeah, I don't know. I just thought I saw that I thought nice
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:23.580]   nice story
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:25.900]   Please don't use the duck duck go browser
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:33.180]   Because they made a deal with them. They made a deal with microsoft to nobody's perfect
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:35.660]   He's perfect to allow microsoft trackers
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:38.460]   uh on third party sites
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:41.260]   Uh duck duck go I guess uses being
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:47.420]   A duck duck go does not store any personal identifiers with your search queries, but microsoft advertising
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:50.460]   May track your ip address and other information
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:53.500]   for accounting purposes
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:39:01.660]   Like we're gonna make money accounting purposes. Anyway, the duck duck go guys. It's not it's not the search
[01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:03.420]   It's just the browser
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:07.020]   He posted on uh on reddit doing a little
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:10.860]   Reclamation point put a show well
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:16.860]   I realized we were trying to go upbeat and now i'm about to talk about the dystopia, but the um the degree to which
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:19.420]   Tracking intimate medical details
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:26.540]   Is so easy. Yeah, um it was kind of something I was like i'm aware of this and I kind of thought okay
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:29.100]   But that's not a problem that would affect me and then
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:36.940]   A phone call I made seemed to have been reflected in an ad I saw on my twitter app and that just um
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:40.380]   No, that's the tether. Do you see vfkc cafe?
[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:43.820]   Uh, I see a variety of things. Um
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:46.380]   What would impor- oh
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:51.420]   That they well I think tecturn said they're just politely asking not to track kids, but
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:58.220]   No, they're using uh, uh f2a phone data to sell to advertisers. Oh twitter. Yeah
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:01.660]   $150 million twitter got a big fine some but this was
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:05.980]   Probably not related to a phone call you made kathy twitter is going to pay $150 million
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:12.300]   Because just like facebook a couple of years ago remember they they get your your number so they can send you a uh
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:16.220]   Two-factor code, but they've been using it to target ads
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:21.180]   Now that's the phone number. Yeah, but I don't I don't think kathy's phone call
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:25.180]   Well, maybe so I was trying to figure out what the vector was
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:30.940]   Um, and i'm actually less upset by twitter at this because twitter is sort of like what's some data
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:35.260]   That's reusable for us to give us ads and if that was the extent of my relationship where
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:41.100]   I wouldn't have been as bothered, but twitter didn't know about the phone call that I made and yet somehow
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:44.860]   It had information about me that suggested I had made this phone call
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:52.860]   So I'm more worried about who scooped up information about my phone call to then pass it on to somebody for whom that information would be useful
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:55.500]   I'm more worried about the initial scooping up
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:02.460]   Uh, i'm trying to figure out what the vector was and the only thing I can think about is it was the phone call
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:09.260]   Um, but this is why people think like facebook is listening to you because there's certain things where it's like the topic you are interacting with
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:13.420]   Was so esoteric and yet some somehow there's a very direct correlation
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:17.820]   It could not have been an acquaintance later like in an ad you're sure it's not a coincidence
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.500]   It doesn't feel like it was a coincidence. Yeah
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:24.060]   Because I hear all of this on and then I realize no, this is not normal
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:31.980]   Yeah, I hear this all the time my amlexa or my google assistant was listening in or instagram was listening and it's giving me ads
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:34.380]   based on something I said
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:36.780]   Um, and I can't say for sure it's not
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:39.260]   but
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:41.100]   There I mean, you know, I
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:43.100]   Take back that is twitter
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:47.980]   Yeah, because it wasn't just twitter it was um, I was watching to be on roku
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:52.140]   And I got an ad and a part of me is like, oh, this is the normal ad I would have seen at this
[01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:55.100]   And then i'm like, hang on a second. These are not ads that everybody else sees
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:57.580]   These are ads that are somehow being tailored to me
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:03.180]   And it thought I would want to see this ad and the only reason I could think of why it thought
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:05.740]   I might want to see that ad was because of this phone call I had made
[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:08.060]   So I'm trying to figure out what the vector was of
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:14.700]   Why did I think that was appropriate and something that I would want because it was the type of thing that in this day and age would be very very very
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:16.540]   concerning for
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:20.940]   People to be able to have that insight into what I might what might be going on in my life, right?
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:28.620]   Doj says it's not going to prosecute white hat security
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:33.980]   Researchers, which will relieve I think quite a few security researchers who have been very nervous
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:38.300]   About the computer fraud and abuse act, which has been used to harass
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:41.340]   Many people including of course the late erin Schwartz
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:44.860]   Um, we'll see
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:48.700]   I'd still be nervous. We'll see
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:53.900]   The department's goals for cfa enforcement are to promote privacy and cyber security
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:59.180]   By upholding the legal right of individuals network owners and operators to ensure their confidentiality
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:02.620]   Uh, the eff has of course
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:08.940]   You know lobbied to let white hat hackers, you know, do their job
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:11.020]   We need that
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:15.580]   And but it's always been risky and we have there are many stories of
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:20.940]   White hats being at least investigated under the cfa. So let's see. Let's hope
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:23.340]   Here's another happy story
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:31.340]   Electrify america, which is the big charging network that vw is installing across the united states after their diesel gate
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:36.620]   This is part of their reparations will be 100 solar powered by 2023
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:39.420]   Yeah
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:43.260]   Already it's 100 renewable electricity as of april
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:49.580]   So when you get your electric car and you drive by the gas station charging seven bucks a gallon
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:53.180]   And you go down to electrify america know that the sun is powering
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:59.580]   Where do you charge yours at home? And this is you know, a lot of electric car people
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:03.820]   Uh, uh, uh, perspective buyers of electric vehicles worry
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:10.380]   About this because they with a gas vehicle you can't fill it up at home. So they're always worried. Well, where am I going to charge it
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:15.820]   The truth is most of us never drive more than you know 50 or 60 miles a day
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:20.940]   And most cars have 100 or 200 or three minus 250 miles per charge
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:25.100]   I charge it every night at home using solar power from our solar panels
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:27.660]   And we're going to drive
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:32.220]   Longer if then you would use electrify america your or something similar i've used electrify america
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:33.820]   Can you use teslas?
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:37.180]   No, well, not as of now someday tesla says maybe
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:41.340]   Um, any in the uk, I think there's one tesla supercharger you can use
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:43.980]   And the old country
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:48.620]   But uh, but but bear electrify america, which is this is the good news about diesel gate
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:52.300]   They're going to be all over the country. They're putting in thousands of them. So
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:56.460]   Uh, and they're fast chargers. They're good fast chargers, but again, if you go to
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.060]   Go ahead a big power wall thing as well then I do have two power walls
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:04.940]   Yeah, okay, 60 panels if you were charging for seven a power at nine. I was like, that's a good trick. It's a good trick
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:09.900]   And at tech. I mean, honestly, it's technically probably not, you know, because it's
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:15.900]   We sell it back to the utility company, etc, etc, but yeah, we're generating more electricity than we use
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:22.620]   Which is good. Yeah, uh, so yeah, if you're worried about it if you want to buy an electric vehicle buy one
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:27.340]   What's uh, what's the price of petrol per liter in the uk these days?
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:31.740]   I don't know. I haven't you have an electric vehicle also obviously
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:36.700]   I have an electric buy school. Yeah, I love my electric bicycles if we could just get rid of all the cars
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:41.900]   I'd be happy to ride my electric bicycle everywhere, but I don't i'm terrified of getting creamed
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:45.100]   So i'm out of step with
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:52.060]   I'm out of step with everyone because I have a petroleum powered car and a non electrified bicycle
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:59.260]   Well, that's okay. It's better to pedal muscle. Yeah, muscle power is always better. Yeah, are you south bay?
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:00.780]   I mean, it's not far down there
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:05.980]   No, um, i'm north bay. Um, the biking is good here or oh, please speaking
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:09.980]   No, I mean actually the south bay is also very good. Where are you located? Kathy
[01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:12.540]   north bay
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:14.540]   We're in petal Loma. Where are you?
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:19.740]   Northern meringue. Uh, you're like five miles away. We should just get together and do this
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:24.140]   You can you wouldn't have to worry about your mic up here. You better off in the parking lot
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:26.940]   With wi-fi than where she is now
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:33.580]   No, run out of ethernet cord. I could plug directly. Oh, I need to i need a dongle, but yeah, I understand. Oh
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:37.740]   Okay, no, I mean I used to I used to cycle everywhere in the bay area too
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:43.260]   Um, but I didn't have an electric bike there because they would they went really straightforward then because yeah, they are now man
[01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:48.780]   I mean they're and they're wonderful Kathy ever is it an assistant? Yeah, it's pet
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:51.580]   They're all pet by law. They are petal assist. Although
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:54.620]   If you get one with a throttle
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:58.460]   Yeah, you can well you need you need to spend a lot of time pedaling
[01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:05.660]   Well, I mean the well, there's different grades. I mean there's there's ones that are basically motorbikes that are electric
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:11.340]   Um, but the the primary thing is petal assist and it just means that um when you hit a hill you're not
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:17.260]   Um gonna be swimming and getting down because you actually get up the hill more. It's lovely. That's what I need
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:19.820]   I have we have one two three
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:23.580]   Four five electric bicycles one of them is a trike
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:29.660]   Uh, which I keep driving into a ditch because unlike a bicycle where you lean this deer
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:35.660]   A trike you turn the handles to steer and I keep forgetting that and i'm leaning and the bike continues
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:40.060]   In the direction of the ditch. It's okay. It's okay
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:43.980]   Why do you why do you have a trike to pull a groceries back home or what?
[01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:49.980]   Well, I could do that with my other bike too because I have lots of panniers and baskets and things but uh, uh,
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:54.220]   Uh, well, it was my theory because I again, I don't want to get groomed
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:58.380]   That if I an old man was driving a tricycle
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:01.500]   People would go around me
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:06.060]   You know, but now i'm still not convinced of that we have a ghost bike on the way to work
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:11.100]   There's a bridge I'd have to go over that is a very has a bike lane this wide. That's tiny
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:16.060]   And and there's a ghost bike there where a guy last year got killed by a
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:20.540]   An elderly motorist who had taken too much of his meds and just kind of
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:24.780]   And uh, and I realized you know in a battle against a vehicle
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:29.260]   I don't care how many helmets i'm wearing. I'm not going to win. So
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:33.820]   Yeah, I have been I have had a close encounter with a car
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:39.260]   And I was I was a kid but sort of been there done that don't need to yeah, so so
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:41.500]   unfortunately the
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.500]   There are lots of streets here with no
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:50.860]   sidewalk no bike lanes and very fast vehicles. We just this like everywhere else in the country. We are not I
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:52.940]   I'm thinking of moving to amsterdam
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:49:01.420]   I just lost school in german. Yeah, yeah, there are more bikes per capita
[01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:07.100]   In amsterdam in uh hall and netherlitz i think they would they would look down upon you for an electric assisted bike wouldn't they?
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:09.260]   Just
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:11.260]   I'm not against it. I'm no
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:19.820]   I do because I do it myself. That's what granny gears are for. I do it both ways uphill in the snow whatever like um
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:22.700]   It's fun and I do it a lot. It's it's good for you
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:28.540]   I well when I grew up in new jersey, I did in the snow but um but less of an issue out here
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:32.700]   It's good for you. I know I but I I'm old
[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:39.100]   Does it yeah bike lanes honestly really ought to have uh concrete
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:41.980]   Partitions, but yes, they should have separate barriers. That's absolutely true
[01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:48.700]   Yeah, because it's just too easy to veer into or turn into i'd well I'd and not annoying one today where I was um cycling along
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:53.900]   Um and somebody come like pulled in the bike mountain parks. He was waiting for his kids to happen all the time
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:57.420]   And I worried about being
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:02.780]   This was a separated bike lane. There was a grass verge and a red bike lane and he still parked into it
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:05.420]   Jesus
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:07.500]   Well, I guess i'm not moving to the moors
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:16.860]   You can you can you can ride up like nice roads like the one behind me here. No, I know I know I would I would bicycle there like crazy
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.740]   But there's that you can see you can see my bike behind me
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:22.940]   Um, then he gets the fence there because then I just plan that the stone road
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:28.540]   Oh bike to the bottom of that hill. Oh a little black little black dot. So this is your own uh your own image
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:34.860]   Your own picture. Yeah, I took this very very good. He's good. He's good. He's good. Beautiful. Yeah, so this is just just a
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:37.420]   Miles from your home
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:40.300]   Yeah, there's a there's a hill called roseberry topping which um
[01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:44.540]   Looks like it looks like a volcano. That's roseberry topping
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:46.300]   Of course it is. Yes
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:51.660]   It's kind of it's a slightly weird shape because a chunk fell off it in the 19th century because they were mining a stone
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:54.220]   It fell off so it looks it looks they've volcano shaped
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:58.140]   But then you can you can bike all the way around to the bottom of it and then the last bit is this weird
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:01.740]   Not quite a path not quite a staircase thing that you woke up. It looks yeah
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:07.340]   It looks a little difficult, but uh, it'd be worth the challenge and then are there druid graves or something is it a
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.740]   is it a uh
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:16.540]   Druid no, no, no, not this one. No, this is there's a bunch of stone and then um, a thing you put a um field light on so you can
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:18.780]   a trick point um
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:21.580]   But yeah, there's there's the whole there's the whole cleaver in way and there's a lot
[01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:25.260]   There's lots of like nice walking paths and cycling paths around here
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.580]   So we played a little bit or talked on any way about dolly
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:35.900]   And dolly too, which is from open ai the kind of fun little image generation
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:41.900]   program where you write a text and then uh, here's a bowl of soup
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:45.740]   That looks like a monster spray painted on a wall
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:52.620]   And you see it's it's you know generating that I haven't yet to get permission to to go into well google
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.260]   Says hold my beer
[01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:57.260]   And they've created something called
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.740]   Imagine
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:02.540]   at ima ima gen research
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:09.420]   That research that imaging imaging. But it's like imagining right? Yeah, same idea and
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:11.980]   Images too. It's a fun
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:14.140]   Yeah image gen imagine
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:19.980]   Three spheres made of glass falling into the ocean. So these are not these have never existed before
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:25.340]   Here's a bald eagle made of chocolate powder mango and whipped cream. These are this is not just looking up
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:27.980]   Stuff on the internet
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:32.300]   This is these are gennory basket made from bamboo. I'm really angry
[01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:35.020]   One of them basically to me is a corgi on a bike
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:40.380]   Uh, I can't get back to it. Yeah, I had it and I can't get back to it
[01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:47.500]   Um, anyway, that's kind of cool. It's pretty amazing. I I wish you could play with it. Can you?
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:52.860]   Oh, here's the corgiana bike. No, well you have to get access to it. Yeah
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:57.660]   Have you access to it?
[01:52:57.660 --> 01:52:59.820]   No, no
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:02.620]   I'll ask for it. There was there. Did you see the the vara one
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:06.380]   A centaur except the man parts a jumbo shrimp. Do you see that one this week?
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:08.300]   No
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.700]   I don't be fine. Let me find that for you again. Sintar
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:13.980]   shrimp
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:19.500]   And vital parts jumbo shrimp vital parts should be enough to narrow it down
[01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:23.580]   Nope images for centaur shrimp vital parts gives me
[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:26.220]   Centaur jumbo shrimp
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:27.580]   Centaur
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:30.700]   Jumbo maybe the word jumbo shrimp
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:36.060]   Well, there is a man part was a shrimp not the
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:39.900]   Oh, this is disgusting
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:43.020]   This is this is really loathsome
[01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:47.740]   This is quite a thing. Oh, yeah, that's the one. Yeah, here's the tweet. This isn't
[01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:54.620]   This isn't either of these two. This is another image generation thing that is in prototype
[01:53:54.620 --> 01:54:03.180]   Uh, it says so Jenny and Liz screaming Jenny badge limp shrimp bologna on twitter. Also known as horse was
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:07.420]   Uh says, okay, the ai refuses to give me a normal cat
[01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:12.860]   But when I ask for a centaur except the man part is a jumbo shrimp it nails it
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:19.980]   So I asked someone who had access to darly to try the same thing and it wasn't as good
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.540]   uh, wow
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.540]   Wow
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:29.820]   So I want to see the image I put the link in the um chat
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:33.500]   Uh, okay
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:35.980]   Let's look at the chat
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:39.020]   Uh, which chat did you put that link into?
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:42.060]   Uh, irc, okay. We have so many
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:47.180]   That's true. Yes, not these here it is from a think think vert think word
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:53.420]   Not as good as the viral tweet a centaur except the man part is a jumbo jumbo shrimp
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:58.940]   It's just a system. It's not as nice as the other one. Well, not as scary. This is from image n
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:03.740]   This is this is from darly darly. Okay. So it thing works that i've got
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:07.100]   It remembers what it produced and it won't produce it again because it's learned
[01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:11.020]   It's sort of like I got that out of my system and now i've sort of interacted in some way
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:15.740]   Well, they do tend to give you it does tend to give you model versions. You're supposed to pick the good one. Yeah
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:19.660]   Um, so i want i want to see what image it does with this prompt
[01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:22.540]   Do you think uh
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:25.340]   Can't let you do it. Do you think um
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:28.540]   Right now these are just silly toys
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:34.220]   But yes, we are close do you think to being able to actually say, you know
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:37.820]   President biden falling down the stairs
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:41.740]   And getting an image that is indistinguishable from real
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:48.700]   Um, I think the challenge is that's actually harder than you do you would think I think these these things
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:55.900]   um, they show them with these sort of slightly dardorous things because that that works works better but
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:00.380]   Um, and they're also trying very hard to not generate images of people at the moment
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:03.580]   They're they're all like writing. Oh, we shouldn't do that type of stuff
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:06.140]   But they they will you know, it's it's the casting parents problem again
[01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:08.780]   They're gonna generate images of people then they've got to deal with it
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:12.060]   And then you'll find that using people's faces. They shouldn't be using in trouble
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:15.180]   How effective though in the long run are they gonna be doing stuff like that?
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:20.060]   I mean, you know, you can't only keep have you ever seen a pull up. Sorry pandora's box closed so long
[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:23.820]   Well, I mean, that's you know, we've we've had this with the face generators
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:29.340]   We know that those are those have been a rather than right and those are right right in plausible faces
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:30.700]   um
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:35.820]   You know, if you look very closely you can well if you cherry pick them a bit because they will it also generates like weird
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:41.980]   Extra heads next you sometimes. Yeah. Well, that's also what you have to do with the text. You know, you you'll have uh
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:46.460]   Gpt generate five different versions of text and pick the one that's
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:51.740]   And then you should then you should cherry pick the good ones cherry pick. Um, and and this you know, this was the pretty critique we had of
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:57.740]   Google's um new model when they were showing that off and they were doing it again last week whenever when they did
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:03.580]   Um, was it IO last week? Yeah, I was last week and they were doing the same thing of like well, it makes stuff up sometimes
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:08.940]   And that's but it's still cool. It's like no making stuff up. It's not cool. It's not cool. It is not cool
[01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:14.780]   You will suppose your your entire job was all guys was information making the person accessible and useful
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:17.900]   Instead that's not actually very helpful
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:20.540]   It's the opposite of what you want to be doing
[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:25.260]   And if you're cutting out the middle of man of the spammers who have been doing that to fit it into your search engine
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:29.180]   But and i'm not sure that's actually a helpful sort of disintermediation. Thank you
[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:36.060]   It's kind of the way computer science is that the first 80 percent is easy, but the last one percent is intractable
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:43.420]   Whether it's self-driving vehicles or face recognition or handwriting recognition or generating images or text
[01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:47.100]   It's always that I think some of them converge a bit better than others
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:50.220]   I mean the stuff they've been doing with audio processing is actually very impressive
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:53.260]   But but yeah, you've got the translator things
[01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:55.660]   um
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:58:01.340]   That sort of mostly work, but they work with the language they've got they're trying to scale them to other languages and that's not as
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:04.940]   Somebody has an amazing simulation of an actual phone ringing
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:07.660]   Okay, it's jeff
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:13.500]   I know it's a simulation because no one actually has a phone that rings anymore
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:16.220]   so
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:18.860]   tough to forge digital drivers license
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:24.380]   Is actually pretty easy to forge a litany of security flaws
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:30.460]   This is the government of new south whales in australia rolling out digital drivers licenses
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:37.180]   They said would provide additional levels of security and protection against identity fraud compared to plastic
[01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:39.100]   drivers licenses
[01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:41.100]   Well, no, not
[01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:47.900]   You know, this is doomed from the whole way that they decided that what they were trying to do was even better because they were
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:52.380]   They were ignoring all the security problems. You don't put your digital ID on your phone
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:55.340]   You don't put it on something that you might hand to a cop
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:59.420]   And no
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:05.260]   This wasn't something that was broken like the whole bit with like RFID chips in in your passports
[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:09.980]   Like oh, this will make us safer in some way. No, it just provided another vector for
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:12.220]   attackers to suck up
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:17.820]   identities from like it was just this idea that like oh, we're just gonna add this
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:24.700]   This latest buzzword and everything will be miraculously wonderful and this magical thinking is just absolutely terrible when it comes to
[01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:33.100]   Particularly changing any system that worked in an offline analog into something digital like it's so under the rights
[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:35.100]   it's so undercooked and
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:40.380]   Making something digital does not make it better it tends to introduce a thousand more problems
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:45.260]   That you never bothered to anticipate, which is why I thank god. We're not voting on the internet yet
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:51.580]   Exactly like that is a system where um, no, this is not a thing
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:56.220]   That will help uh the pixel watch is gonna have a
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:58.620]   like
[01:59:58.620 --> 02:00:03.100]   Bitcoin like oh, we're just gonna add the blockchain that'll make blockchain makes everything better
[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:05.500]   like bacon
[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:07.500]   pixel watch will have
[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:11.500]   a two-year-old exenos 91 10 processor, but
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:14.220]   We'll also have a physical
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:16.860]   USB seaport what
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:23.580]   Um charge it somehow. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, but usually they charge it with some sort of
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:26.540]   You know wireless charging thing
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:31.740]   I I don't really credit this it'll have 32 gigs of storage. Is there this is rumors
[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:35.260]   Even if you've announced something apparently it's possible to have rumors
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:37.820]   Uh 32 gigs of storage is a lot
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:40.060]   it'll have
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:42.060]   a lot of ram as well
[02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:43.980]   uh
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:47.660]   More ram than any existing smartwatch today according to nine to five google
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:50.220]   and apparently
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:51.820]   It will have
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:57.900]   A usb seaport. I maybe that's just a diagnostic port early apple watches. I think had something like that
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:02.540]   So maybe that's how how is it they still haven't managed to integrate fit bit
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:07.660]   Google. I mean, yeah, so fringy is their employee and why is it still a third party?
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:13.820]   Up to fit that moves between the two you own it. I guess it may it's a hard computer science problem Kevin
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:21.020]   I could see it being a regulatory compliance problem that you've got to integrate these things and they may not be easily
[02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:26.380]   Integratable like even just from the privacy policy standpoint that that's gonna take a lot of lawyer hours to do
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:31.580]   Is that deal actually closed? I think that was oh, yeah, they own fit bit. Yeah, yeah, they are
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:33.580]   Yeah, they are fit. Yeah, it's like
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:39.260]   But they bet they may have made some new instead. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:42.540]   Uh, let's see
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:44.300]   Make you think compatible. That's the problem
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:47.020]   Facebook is paying if you are a resident of illinois
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:50.780]   Facebook is paying each and every one of you three hundred ninety seven dollars
[02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:56.380]   Because illinois is one of the few states in the union that has a good
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:59.260]   biometric
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:01.260]   anti biometric
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:04.380]   Law
[02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:11.820]   It was a class action suit started in 2015 a lawsuit of face against facebook because of a facial recognition feature the social
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.540]   media network used
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:17.900]   Would recognize your face and tag you in photos you may remember that
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:22.140]   However, it is a violation of the illinois state privacy law
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:27.500]   Which forbids any company from collecting biometric data from its users without consent
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:30.540]   Uh
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:31.900]   Big victory
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:33.260]   $97
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:36.540]   I'll take it or who gets it and who doesn't think everybody. I don't know
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:40.780]   Everybody you probably have to be an illinois resident. You're in the class. You have to be an illinois resident
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:43.100]   You have to have used facebook. I guess
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:47.740]   Uh, if you oh you have to sign up and you know file your claim and all that
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:53.740]   But you'll be getting a check in the next few days look for a an email illinois residents
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:56.860]   Uh
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:03:02.380]   Kelly and Conway my husband George abandoned me for twitter. That's all
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:08.620]   Co responded in the divorce
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:17.020]   No, well, that's the straight. It's the strangest thing. I mean she's been her book is apparently fairly vicious about George
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:20.460]   But they're still married so I don't know you know
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:25.020]   No one knows what really goes on your thorough marriage to each their own
[02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:39.500]   Uh, I am not gonna do a change luck. Sorry. Nope. Not gonna do it. I'm just scanning through looking for fun
[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:45.180]   In what is the grub hub fiasco? That was that we talked about last week where they stood a $15
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:51.180]   Thousands of orders came in. Oh, yeah has more reporting about that. Oh god what a mess what an incredible
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:53.740]   Uh, uh screw up. It was
[02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:58.940]   You know, especially since it costs grub hub nothing and it cost the restaurants
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:03.100]   Well now they're gonna offer further coupons to people who didn't get their food and all that
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:06.460]   But the whole restaurant's just suffered terribly. Yeah terribly. Yeah
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:11.660]   Uh, I'm taking it that you pasted these in like the introduction
[02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:19.100]   I know I didn't paste in the introduction of microsoft excel in 1992. Have you seen this one? No, but all of us let's play it
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:21.580]   All right
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:24.620]   1992
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:32.540]   It's on youtube. This is uh, apparently when excel came out it was on the mag first wasn't it
[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:37.660]   I feel like it was tough woman goes by clearly the boss very nervous employee
[02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:41.820]   Can't wait for somebody else to come in the guy finally comes in look at all too casual
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:47.420]   I just saw wilson you're showing other projections for the new vacation packages this morning. I am
[02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:50.780]   Thank god. I have microsoft excel
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:53.340]   Well, just wait
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:55.740]   Is this the greed is good era?
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:59.980]   Yeah, it's just one little spread shade
[02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:06.700]   This could make a break the deal her exact words were 9 a.m. Or never come down
[02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:10.860]   Did you feel bad for these guys who were apparently real actors? Oh, yeah
[02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:17.740]   I've got a gig. I got a gig. I'm gonna be in an ad for microsoft excel
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:20.460]   not even an ad it's a four-minute
[02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:26.860]   I don't want to watch you in full-person. All right. Yeah, um recording obsolete sounds
[02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:33.020]   I found this one interesting. I like this we're going by the way in case you didn't notice we're going through jeff's
[02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:35.260]   submissions
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:37.820]   Jeff's weirdness, but I do like this one
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:43.820]   Because there are what are obsolete sounds what would you what would be the sound of a vcr?
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:46.460]   Yeah, uh, rewinding
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:48.620]   um
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:50.620]   Strong
[02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:55.660]   300 bob modem. Yeah, uh, they want people to record these sounds so we have them so we hold on to them
[02:05:55.660 --> 02:06:03.100]   Um, they can't they'll soon be the sound of a dial tone no doubt or rotary phone or all these things
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:05.660]   So they just want people to record. Uh, they don't have them yet
[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:09.660]   But it's a pro you know one of those open projects when they want everybody record sounds
[02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:15.500]   So so go find all of your right there a twit you could do a hundred of these we have a lot of obsolete sounds here
[02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:21.660]   Oh, do you ever sit it cities and memory calm cities and memory calm?
[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:25.500]   Which is it loves sounds? I guess it's the world's
[02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:32.060]   Biggest sound project global collaborative sound art and field recording program with the aim of remixing the world
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:36.300]   One sound at a time. This is my you want to hear today's featured sound
[02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:40.460]   Sure it is an early morning bird song
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:44.380]   It's st. Leonard's gardens st. Leonard's on c england
[02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:47.100]   It sounds like
[02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:49.100]   Kevin mark's house
[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:57.100]   My California. Yeah. Yeah, we used to get birds. Yes. Yeah, you'd be out of my errands tree. We could also get some birds
[02:06:57.100 --> 02:07:03.820]   Well, the bus was sleep now because it's closed time clock. This is boring. Why is this why is this bird sound obsolete? That makes me
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:13.020]   No, no, no, that's something new cities and they they did they you know the obsolete sounds is a new project. Right. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:15.580]   I mean the BBC
[02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:22.460]   Sound archive the sound effects archive. That's an amazing amazing. They have they will have lots of obsolete weird stuff in there
[02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:25.420]   Yeah, that's that's that's there. That's very good. It's very useful
[02:07:25.420 --> 02:07:32.140]   I have actually browsed the BBC sounds archive. That's amazing. That was created for the radio
[02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:35.820]   Division, I guess to for radio plays and things like that
[02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:42.540]   Yeah, yeah, and yeah, and was there and they just gathered it over time and they used to these to distribute it on record and cd
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:48.300]   I I've I've ever getting what a sound effects went out of the library when I was about 14 and playing at home
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:51.180]   Scaring the crap out of my mother because it was a huge explosion
[02:07:51.180 --> 02:08:00.700]   Now you've come up with a good use for these though. That's good. Yeah, let's take a little break
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:07.420]   We are going to get some pics and ideas and stuff like that. I love you guys. Kathy gellis is always great to have you

[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:16.220]   Jeff Jarvis
[02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:21.660]   You know, Frank Sinatra called him a bum. He is a nickel millionaire according to ray crock
[02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:27.260]   And an unbeloved member of our team the only one who showed up today. Kevin
[02:08:27.260 --> 02:08:31.980]   Yeah, Kevin marks also always a glad I have Kevin on
[02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:36.780]   indyweb.org or show today brought to you by policy genius
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:39.980]   policy genius
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:46.380]   I um, you know when you have kids first thing that goes to your mind is I'm I got some responsibilities
[02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:47.980]   now
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:52.220]   Uh, and that first very first thing I did is went out and got life insurance
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:54.860]   life insurance is
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:59.420]   I think one of those things it's like being a grown-up gives you peace of mind
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:03.740]   If something happens to you your loved ones would have a financial cushion
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:09.020]   Uh, you may have some life insurance for your job. I know we we have some but it's not a lot
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:12.140]   Most people need up to 10 times more coverage
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:17.980]   To properly provide for their families and of course life insurance gets more expensive as you get older
[02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:21.260]   So it's always a good idea to get your policy as young as you can
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:24.620]   and if you're going to do it, you should shop around because
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:31.260]   Not all policies are created equal. That's how policy genius works policy genius is one place to go

[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:04.780]   Now because you're going to you know end up buying life insurance
[02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:06.780]   They have to be licensed agents

[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:55.020]   You can also get coverage that does not have medical exams. That's nice. If you want it
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:11:00.940]   Uh, it just depends on the policy obviously since 2014 policy genius has helped over 30
[02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:03.980]   Million people shop for insurance
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:08.220]   They've placed over 150 billion dollars in coverage. It's not a fly-by-night
[02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:14.140]   They've been around since 2014 and a lot of people have used them now. It's not just for life insurance
[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:21.580]   They have home auto disability renters all the insurance, but I just want to I just kind of want to hit the life insurance thing
[02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:25.180]   I've been thinking about that lately, you know, and and it's so important
[02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:29.260]   Especially when you have a young family policy genius
[02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:35.740]   Dot com slash twig and I have to say my daughter's 30 my son's 27

[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:54.860]   Does tick tock count as a job? I guess it does he makes money in
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:12:01.420]   Policy genius dot com slash twig we thank you policy genius for supporting this week in
[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:03.580]   Google
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:07.740]   Now, uh, Kathy and kevin i'm not going to put you on the spot unless you want to participate
[02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:13.580]   But uh, here's your opportunity. I know you're a hui louis fan. Kathy gellis
[02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:16.300]   So go ahead
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:21.740]   Give us your hui louis pick of the week well, you should um, there's two tweets there
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:25.260]   You should click on them because this is about the picture. So click on the hui one first
[02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:29.900]   I got it here. He is at the anti now he can he speak? I know he can't sing
[02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:35.980]   Can he speak? Yeah, he can speak. Yeah, yeah, okay, right. So he was out on pittsburgh because he
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:41.420]   Uh participated in some way with a film about um
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:47.580]   Endangered birds and bird conservation and that film debuted at the car niggy center in pittsburgh
[02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:52.540]   So he was out there and while he was in pittsburgh he apparently toured the andi warhol
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:59.660]   Museum and this I decided meant that he was trolling me because if you click on the other tweet the one that from me
[02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:01.020]   Yes
[02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:04.140]   Okay, click on that and look at the picture. Okay. Yes. Oh
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:06.860]   You did that was my birthday cake
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:09.980]   Campbell soup can on your birthday cake
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:16.140]   Right because my birthday happens to be world intellectual property day according to white bow
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:21.740]   And I've decided well, they could see me coming so they made my birthday the day that we are going to celebrate
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:24.140]   intellectual property and
[02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:28.940]   um, so every year for the last couple years I've tried to come up with a thematically appropriate cake
[02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:35.820]   And in this particular instance because of the terrible decision from the second circuit involving Andy warhol
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:40.540]   Which kind of ruined fair use which is now going to be heard by the supreme court
[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:45.900]   Um, I decided that to celebrate world intellectual property. I had an Andy warhol themed cake
[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:49.260]   And I had to figure out how to do it and I got you know my campbell soup can
[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:56.860]   So I did that that was like a month ago and then Huey shows up, you know at the Andy warhol museum while Andy warhol is so relevant to my life
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:59.420]   So, you know, this is just the synergy I have with you
[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:02.060]   I was that like he plugs into the legal issues
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:05.900]   I'm thinking about and just you know makes his own derivative works consistent
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:10.220]   You're gonna better watch out. You're gonna start getting ads for Huey Lewis merchandise in your twitter feed
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:15.180]   This would be bad. I really don't understand that would be fine. That would be fine for everyone
[02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:19.740]   What is the terrible decision? I didn't hear this about warhol
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:23.180]   And his is it about his Campbell soup can
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:29.660]   Not the Campbell soup can it was about his prince pictures where he had the prince prince
[02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:33.500]   grinc p ri nts and um
[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:39.100]   He they were famous pictures where he had taken a photo and then he had kind of stylized them
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:44.700]   And in the way that he stylized them they became quite famous because they captured a certain essence of the artist prince
[02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:48.460]   In a way that the original picture hadn't and so these were you know
[02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:54.700]   prototypical warhol works that existed for a long long time and then the original photographer
[02:14:54.700 --> 02:15:00.700]   Eventually discovered this that it was her picture that had been used and so she's booed
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:08.220]   And somehow the second circuit decided that she had a leg to stand on and that um it wasn't fair use and she
[02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:11.420]   Had a claim against his estate now
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:19.500]   Um, there's some irony because the warhol estate I believe has also sort of gone after other people further potentially fair uses of warhol works
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:21.740]   But in this case it really
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:26.860]   Broke a lot and it also ended up a decision that was inconsistent with google versus
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:30.460]   With oracle v google which also addressed fair use
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:34.940]   So um, there was a cert petition the supreme court and they agreed to hear this case
[02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:41.500]   So um, hopefully it will straighten this case out and the one that actually concerned me more was one from the ninth circuit
[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:45.420]   Which I think was even worse which had to do with the mashup of um
[02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:49.500]   the oh the places you'll go which was the star trek and dr
[02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:58.540]   Su smash up and there was a and the it was defended successfully at the district court and then the ninth circuit court of appeals just sort of
[02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:05.180]   Tor up so much fair use wasn't fair use you'd be liable and uh that case ended up settling
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:11.260]   But after this terrible decision that would have kept it going and I think that one was even worse because at least in the second
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:13.580]   circuit case you had a living
[02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:15.660]   uh copyright
[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:23.500]   The the original artist was at least still alive and then going after art produced by somebody who no longer was whereas in the ninth circuit
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:27.500]   You had the estate of a dead person shutting down future
[02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:34.460]   Creative expression of a live person and this is an awful lot of power that the dead would have over our lives
[02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:36.380]   If this is the way that fair use works
[02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:42.620]   So I'm really hoping that we'll get some clarity from the supreme court to sort of make fair use be usable
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:48.140]   Because if it's chilling other works that bring new ideas and new thoughts together
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:57.580]   But are built on the shoulders you stand on the shoulders of giants you use the works that came before to inform your creativity now because that's how art works
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:01.420]   Um, this has to be something that you have a safe space to do
[02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:05.900]   And if you don't have a reliable fair use defense, then you're not going to be able to do it
[02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:09.020]   And that's an awful lot of new expression. We're not going to get to experience
[02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:11.500]   It's kind of a weird case because the photographer
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:13.260]   Uh
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:17.660]   Did light it was licensed to uh, vanity fair. He used it then he continued to use it
[02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:23.260]   She was unaware of it until she saw a vanny fair article in 2016 after
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:28.380]   Uh prince's death. They the warhol estate preemptively sued her
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:34.700]   So she didn't even bring suit. They sued her preemptively and uh, and one
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:39.980]   And then now she says well, I don't think that's fair either the judge said
[02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:41.820]   Uh
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:48.620]   The transformation was sufficient that uh, the prince series works can reasonably perceive to have transferred prince
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:54.220]   So, um, you know, none of the pieces none of the parts of the original photo
[02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:59.580]   Uh are still there even though it is recognizable as a as an altered worker the original
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:04.780]   She is she is now countersuit not countersuing. She's now appealing to the supreme court
[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:10.860]   She appealed and she won. Um, and now that boy get reviewed. Oh, so they're a parent. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so
[02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:14.940]   Uh, so, uh, so yeah, I think the warhol estate probably did a declaratory judgment
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:21.260]   They won for a finding of fair use she appealed that the second circuit undid it and now that's being reviewed by the supreme court
[02:18:21.260 --> 02:18:27.820]   But the one of the biggest formative right that's your your position is this is a trans sufficiently transformative
[02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:30.860]   That it doesn't have to they didn't have to
[02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:36.460]   License so the problem the problem with the second circuit decision is it really conflated two things
[02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:40.700]   Where if this conflation could happen then fair all a lot of transform of works are in trouble
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:46.540]   Which is you you do have the exclusive right as the copyright owner to control derivative works
[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:54.700]   And but at the same time fair use is it is found to be fair use when it's sufficiently transformative
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:58.380]   So what does it mean if you've transformed something into something new?
[02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:05.020]   Have you now changed it and that's fair use or have you essentially made a derivative work and the way the second circuit decision reads is
[02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:09.500]   You made a derivative work of the original but that would just obviate
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:14.780]   All sorts of transformative uses because in theory they're inherently derivative
[02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:19.580]   So there's got to be some other delineator to make that the the new things that people are building
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:22.060]   Not something that the original
[02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:29.180]   Us the original create copyright owner would have been able to control because if they can control everything then there's an awful
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:36.300]   Lot of new stuff that can't be developed and this is particularly onerous as copyright terms are just enormous and you know generations
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:38.620]   internet that's built on collaborative
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:40.860]   Building upon
[02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:42.860]   All creations been built on prior creation
[02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:49.740]   Exactly on the net. Yeah, it's especially yeah, so both cases from the ninth and the second circuit are really troubling because
[02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:51.260]   um
[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:54.620]   You can't do anything new the original person who may be dead
[02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:58.780]   Um gets veto power and that's that's no way to run a railroad
[02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:02.220]   Like you the whole point of copyright laws because we want to keep getting new stuff
[02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:09.260]   And so these these these decisions are standing in the way of getting new stuff because they're making it legally unsafe to make the new stuff
[02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:12.940]   interesting
[02:20:12.940 --> 02:20:18.700]   Uh very interesting little did he we know that that's the issue he wanted into maybe he maybe he did
[02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:21.100]   No, I should give him credit because he's you elo us. He's wonderful
[02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:22.940]   Uh
[02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:26.220]   Kevin Marks you got a couple of things this week
[02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:30.620]   Oops, he's muted said us or you

[02:20:38.940 --> 02:20:41.180]   You can boot wait a minute. Let's boot up a mac
[02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:46.300]   Running macos 8. So in other words, javascript is fast enough to do
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:49.100]   systemate
[02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:51.100]   Is to make in the browser in the browser
[02:20:51.100 --> 02:20:53.820]   Amazing and it's got a bunch of software in there
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:58.780]   But also the thing you can do with it is you can drag in i i so images the cds
[02:20:58.780 --> 02:21:04.300]   So I can actually play the old cd romms that I made no oh wow and does it work
[02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:08.140]   Yeah, have you taken your old cd romms and put them in there?
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:14.780]   Let me give it go. Hang on. That's hysterical. I've got to play dark castle though while you're doing that. Oh
[02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:17.420]   I'm I can't screenshot
[02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:26.700]   That's okay. So you're what are you're these are the old cds you did for uh the beb or what yeah, well multi-media corporation. Um, uh
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:30.860]   This was your first like your your first job practically
[02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:34.700]   But you can you could download cd romms off mid-net archive
[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:40.460]   Um, and if you and you can drag you can drag them basically, but yeah, this is this is like retro max
[02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:44.220]   It's hysterical. Look at that. It might get is there sound
[02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:48.700]   John is is my yeah, there should be sound on this is is uh
[02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:51.820]   Oh, okay
[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:53.580]   Turn it up
[02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:56.060]   There we go. Oh, this was such a fun game
[02:21:56.060 --> 02:22:03.980]   Wow, all right here was this likely
[02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:06.780]   Oh, I don't know
[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:09.260]   90 this is which one wasn't it
[02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:13.100]   It late 80s early 90s. I think
[02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:16.300]   That's one now another
[02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:19.580]   You don't care about crypto boy
[02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:23.900]   Okay. Yeah, I don't this is this is a tick tock one for Jeff
[02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:25.900]   Yeah
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:53.820]   She's lip-syncing this is this somebody else's original
[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:58.140]   It's this her original, but she did a really recording and then she's she left it out for people to sing along
[02:22:58.140 --> 02:23:02.060]   Salem ilease on tick tock s-a-l-e-m
[02:23:02.060 --> 02:23:04.780]   I l-e-s-e she's also on
[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:12.140]   On the youtube so so this broke out enough that she actually performed it live at GaryVee's. No, did she really
[02:23:12.140 --> 02:23:15.260]   And how did they they laughed right?
[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:19.900]   I think so. Yeah
[02:23:19.900 --> 02:23:24.700]   He's defending he's a he's got an open-sea thing behind him. He's defending it, right
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:30.540]   That's a great song that could be a hit
[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:36.860]   It's actually very catchy. It's a great song. Well done bravo. Salem. I lease s-a-l-e-m
[02:23:36.860 --> 02:23:40.540]   I l-e-s-e. I'm just saying it over and over so she wants to me
[02:23:40.540 --> 02:23:43.100]   uh and now
[02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:44.620]   Jeff's
[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:46.460]   Jeff's stuff of the week jeff
[02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:50.300]   You know how I love technology how its ability to solve problems
[02:23:50.300 --> 02:23:55.420]   I was in doz toros which is a knock-off of of uh je pote lei
[02:23:55.420 --> 02:23:58.780]   In New York where I get to get my lunches when i'm in the city
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:04.300]   And I watched the on the take on on the delivery line woman doing a phone order
[02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:11.020]   Online order putting on absolutely everything on this burrito right? I think there's no way
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:16.780]   She's gonna get that folded under burrito and she mushes it over and mushes it on and mushes it over
[02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:22.620]   And rolls it up tight as can be and then gets the foil around and quickly tightens it up before it explodes
[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:29.020]   Right so there's a problem here that needs technology because as soon as you unwrap that foil it is gonna explode
[02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:35.340]   It's gonna explode. It's gonna explode. So students at uh, oh god. Where is it?
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:41.980]   The uh john's john's hopkins j you undergrads have created an edible burrito tape
[02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:46.700]   To hold your burrito together
[02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:51.900]   Uh, it's actually clear they put some blue dye on the one on the right, but it's actually clear
[02:24:51.900 --> 02:24:55.180]   And it's edible. You know you're eating that's no it's edible. Yeah
[02:24:55.180 --> 02:24:58.220]   So uh, uh erin wash
[02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:05.660]   Uh told uh nbc washington. I'm a student athlete. So i'm not looking to make a skimpy burrito
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:14.940]   They are applying for a patent. So they have not disclosed their formula
[02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:18.140]   And you know what? I hope that uh erin wash
[02:25:18.140 --> 02:25:24.540]   marie eric and rachel nye become crypto billionaires by inventing burrito tape
[02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:31.820]   All they can say is the ingredients are safe to consume our food grade and our common food and dietary additives
[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:37.020]   You know you could actually probably use seaweed strips to do this, but then would add a little
[02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:42.620]   Is it adhesive? Yeah, if you yeah, it's gluey. It's what they hold sushi together. Yeah
[02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:45.820]   Well, but that's the the rice, right?
[02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:50.780]   I don't know the glue. She asked that. I don't know. You started it.
[02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:54.460]   I just gave you a nice burrito tape, but you've got to say
[02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:57.740]   You see we need to do it. Geez
[02:25:57.740 --> 02:26:02.860]   Do you want to do any of these other wonderful ones, but uh, no, that's good off
[02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:06.780]   Not only is crypto going down, but role lectures are going down people are panicked about that
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:08.860]   I found that I felt a little bit of shot and fright ever
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:12.220]   Yeah
[02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:16.220]   Wear your Rolex if you're busy wearing your google watch apple watch
[02:26:16.220 --> 02:26:21.100]   That's right. That's common like how many hands do you have probably why?
[02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:27.820]   The Rolex apparently there is an index the Rolex mark watch market price index
[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:33.820]   Uh and over oh I have to buy it to give five years of historical data
[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:36.700]   But it's been down down down last month
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:42.460]   Plumbening plummeting since its peak back in april
[02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:47.260]   This was the nft before there are nft. Yeah, that's really true. See overpriced watches
[02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:53.740]   The average market index of the 30 most popular Rolex models over time
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:57.020]   Wow
[02:26:57.020 --> 02:26:59.260]   Well, that concludes this edition of
[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:02.140]   This week in whatever the hell we want to talk about
[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:06.540]   Kathy Kathy great to have you as always Kathy gillis

[02:27:16.380 --> 02:27:18.140]   CG council

[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:24.700]   Really appreciate it. Kevin marks
[02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:28.220]   Always a pleasure to see you indy web.org
[02:27:28.220 --> 02:27:32.940]   Uh indy web camp regular meetings. I guess they're all virtual these days
[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:37.100]   So you can go there's one in about an hour and a half. Nice. Yeah
[02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:40.060]   And it doesn't matter where it is
[02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:42.220]   How will a tender those
[02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:45.020]   um, you we get like a
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:47.420]   Half dozen to a dozen people
[02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:53.100]   I really want I you know I have a week to things. I have a static Hugo blog
[02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:56.620]   Uh, I recently added the ability to comment on it
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:28:00.620]   But you have to comment on mastodon, which is nice, but I want to add web mentions to it
[02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:05.260]   So that's gonna be my project for the weekend. Yeah, come well come to chat or indy web
[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:06.940]   Orgham people have already done it
[02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:11.340]   So you'll find people to talk to it about it. Yeah, the channel you can see there's two ways to do it with a static one
[02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:15.900]   You can have a javascript thing that all loads of comments like like which I do on mine
[02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:21.500]   Right, um or you can or you can make them into it at rebuild time, but then you've got to rebuild it
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:25.340]   Each show you get a comment or something. Yeah, yeah, which makes it all tricky
[02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:28.940]   You know the nice thing about Hugo takes nothing no time to rebuild it
[02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:33.500]   I might just make a cron job. I just do that. Yeah. Yeah, but people have done that
[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:40.860]   But I but um I on my side I do it. I have the comments coming dynamically from an external server nice
[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:44.540]   The only bad thing is I know no one's commenting about what
[02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:53.420]   It'll just be depressing, but I still want to do it in spirit if you are at your bridge you get tweets as well, so
[02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:57.260]   Yeah, that's nice. Yeah, I yeah, I'll use bridge II. Yeah
[02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:04.060]   There's some really cool technologies and I wish more people would do you feel like there is more awareness or is it just kind of
[02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:07.500]   It's a group of people. It's happening. Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying
[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:13.980]   We were having a conversation with tumbler about integrating with them, which would be great if we'd be that's huge. Yeah, that's really huge
[02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:17.980]   So that's good. It all starts at indyweb.org
[02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:22.460]   Anything else you'd like to say you can
[02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:26.140]   Use this I think that's this moment in front of the microphone
[02:29:26.140 --> 02:29:32.780]   And then of course there's jeff javis the director of the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism at the

[02:29:54.940 --> 02:29:58.140]   And on that note
[02:29:58.140 --> 02:30:00.060]   That was a fruitcake
