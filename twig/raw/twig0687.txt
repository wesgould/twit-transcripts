[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, kind of a special Twig this week.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.320]   Stacey and Anne have the week off.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.280]   Jeff Jarvis and I get to talk to Rabel, who is putting together something very, very interesting.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.960]   We've talked before about his app, Planetary, but he's going to talk about Scuttlebutt.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.360]   Rabel was the lead developer at ODO.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.000]   Later worked at Twitter, has a lot of thoughts about the social space and a way to make it
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.040]   better for all of us.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.040]   Stay tuned.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.640]   A great conversation is coming up next.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.640]   A lot of history too on Twig.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.120]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.040]   Podcasts you love.

[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.720]   This is Twig.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.080]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.280]   This week in Google, Episode 687, recorded Wednesday, October 26th, 2022, Rabel Rousing.

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.880]   Show we cover the latest news from Google.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.200]   In this case, the latest news from the Fediverse.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.400]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.400]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.400]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.400]   I was so excited about today's show.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.400]   I am too.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400]   I am a special guest.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.800]   Jeff is the Leonard Taill Professor for journalistic innovation at the Cray.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   [MUSIC]
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.840]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.320]   It has the day off.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.040]   So does Stacy.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.360]   So we thought Jeff and I thought, let's bring in somebody.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.480]   Who has something to say about this space.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.640]   I'd like to introduce Rabel.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.640]   Rabel.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.640]   Hello, Rabel.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.120]   Rabel has a lot to say about this space most recently.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120]   I have lots of opinions.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.600]   Most recently, he started a new app called Planetary, which I joined immediately.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.760]   Jeff, you found out about Planetary from Mike Masnick, right?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.480]   Mike Masnick and Daphne Keller, I was at a conference on Freedom of Expression, and we
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.280]   were bemoaning the latest news on Twitter and Musk.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.200]   And they said, and we said, what are the alternatives?
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   What are the alternatives?
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.960]   And the one we came up with, the one they came up with, because they knew was Planetary
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.120]   and Rabel.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.680]   So I signed up.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.360]   It's actually a beautiful app, not surprising, because Rabel has a lot of experience in app
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   design.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.880]   You've been here before.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.640]   I like the choice of purple as the dominant color theme as well.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.640]   Anyway, welcome, Rabel.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.400]   Yeah, thank you so much.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.960]   I've been a fan of Twit forever.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.720]   Well, we kind of intersected because you were the lead at a little company.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.280]   Some will remember called ODO.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   What was ODO?
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   Yep.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   ODO was the first attempt at building a venture-backed funded company in the podcasting space.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.920]   We were going to build tools for discovering podcasts, apps for listening to it, tools for
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.520]   making podcasts.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.640]   And yeah, podcasts was going to be a thing.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.040]   We started in 2004.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.320]   Yeah, when podcasting started, that was literally, you know, I guess they started in
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   the fall of 2004.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   My first podcast was October 2004.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.240]   So yeah, so Rabel, tell me about the moment of the pivot when you went away from podcasting.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.560]   Yeah, so we were doing a podcasting thing.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.880]   We went down to Apple and said, let's do a partnership and put the audio directory inside
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:00.240]   iTunes and build creator tools and optimize the interface on the iPod because the iPhone
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.440]   didn't exist then.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.560]   And Apple said, oh, thank you very much.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.600]   Those are great ideas.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.680]   And they turned around and did something without us whatsoever.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680]   Jesus.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.360]   You introduced them to the idea.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.920]   Audio was great.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.840]   We were, you know, immediately, as soon as audio started, we got in the directory.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.640]   It was creation of Evan Williams, whose name you may remember and know a glass.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.560]   Evan had come off of Blogger and founded an audio blog at Pyralabs.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.640]   Actually, audio blog was Noah's thing.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.680]   Yeah, audio blog was Noah's thing.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   Which everyone made fun of him for.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.600]   And that was the beginning of the obvious corporation.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.400]   Yep.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.880]   I loved audio, but it turned out that there wasn't much future given Apple's interest
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.480]   in the space.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.160]   And Evan did something quite famous.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.080]   He gave the money back to the investors.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.560]   So although I think that most people a couple years later realized he gave the money back
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   to the investors and therefore they didn't have shares in Twitter.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.960]   So I'm not sure people were excited in the long run about having them.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.760]   Their money being returned.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   Here's your cash card.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.360]   That's just redeeming with Walmart.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.360]   I could have had presealed shares in Twitter.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.000]   I think I would have preferred that.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.920]   But at the time it was like an incredibly impressive thing to do.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.920]   Like it was high integrity.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   It was very generous at the time.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.920]   Although maybe Evan had in the back was my new list.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.440]   This stock might be worth more than I'm giving back.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.440]   I don't know.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.720]   What was the time gap between that act and the Eureka for starting Twitter?
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.880]   Oh, the stock got given back after Twitter was started.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.880]   Oh, it did.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.120]   So Charles River had a pretty big stake then in Twitter.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.360]   I think I've ever had a pretty big stake.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.720]   Although my recollection is that Charles River was the investor that pushed to be given
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.720]   back their money.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   Right.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.160]   Everybody else was like, we'll let the bet ride.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.840]   And Charles River is like, actually, I think you're doing a crazy thing.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.120]   Give me my money back.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.760]   In hindsight, that seems so wrong.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.840]   They were allowed to come back in at later rounds of Twitter and made money, but not
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.720]   nearly as much money as they had originally.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.960]   So what were you doing before ODEO?
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.640]   How did you get into this space?
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.280]   So what I was doing before ODEO was I was building a bunch of tools around text messaging.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.040]   I built a social network called TextMob that we were using to do social network updates
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.480]   over text messages specifically for protests and political organizing.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.480]   Oh, interesting.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.160]   We used it in New York at the Republican National Convention in 2004.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.760]   So you even then, you saw the potential for organizing and protests of this kind of messaging
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   system.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   Absolutely.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.600]   I was trying to figure out how do we use emerging technology for social change.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.840]   And what happened was at ODEO when the, like, when we just got crushed by Apple, we were
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.040]   saying, okay, well, what do we do?
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.080]   What do we want to do next?
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.640]   And myself and one of the other developers at ODEO, Blaine Cook, had been hacking on
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.480]   this side project to build a social network stuff over text messaging.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.640]   We're like, well, why don't we do something with this, like this thing called TextMob.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.960]   And TextMob wasn't right.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:47.000]   It wasn't like it was more small groups and it, you know, you had to use an email gateway.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.960]   It was, you know, it was funky, but it was a model.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.120]   And so the whole company spent a week using TextMob and we used a couple other text message
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.320]   systems and we explored what would be the future of email and other things.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:03.400]   And that was the basis that then went into the hackathons that created Twitter.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   Wow.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   So that was a lot of the inspiration then for Twitter.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   Wow.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.120]   I mean, I would say that the internet inspiration refrigerator was TextMob, like, oh, we can
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.840]   do this thing where we have like lightweight social networks over text messages.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.760]   And then we looked at past networks we'd used and what we liked and we looked at blogger
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.600]   and the way it had, you know, maybe there should be something that reads and writes
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.240]   at the same time as a feed reader and a publishing tool.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.240]   And then we, you know, looked at Jack's stuff with bicycle messenger dispatch and status
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.720]   updates and Twitter was really all of these ideas thrown into a blender.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.320]   What did you learn at TextMob that you brought to Twitter?
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   What didn't work at TextMob?
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.320]   Because it's very similar.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.920]   It was text messaging, right?
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.760]   It was SMS.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.640]   So the, the, the follower relationship that Twitter has, you know, a TextMob was a bidirectional
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.280]   thing and it had formal groups.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.320]   So you would either join a large group or a small group and you could send out to everybody
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.760]   in the group.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.600]   There were broadcasts but I couldn't just follow other specific people in TextMob.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.280]   And TextMob was the, it was really hard to sign up.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:28.880]   Like we, you know, what Noah did was he actually got an old Nokia phone and had some, you know,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.000]   pirated Windows software and plugged in a USB cable.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.600]   And that's how Twitter started sending SMSs.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:43.880]   TextMob actually used a Java applet that ran an email gateway for SMS delivery and we would
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.440]   just hide it in other web pages.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.760]   And so in the background it'd be, you know, running this peer to peer network sending it
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.200]   because we didn't want to spend any money.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.400]   But Twitter's use of, you know, an actual phone worked better.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:08.720]   And then eventually, you know, we actually got relationships with carriers and legitimately
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.880]   delivered the SMSs.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.840]   I remember in the early days Twitter had a short code which made it a lot easier.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   What was the short code?
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.840]   It was good.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   Yep, 404.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   That's it, 404.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.040]   That's another good joke, yeah.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.640]   Were you, so at this time Twitter was in San Francisco.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.760]   Were you in that famous South Park gathering where they're on the swings and playing on
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.720]   the playground and coming up with this whole idea?
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.080]   I mean, there were lots of these conversations.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.640]   Yes, I spent a bunch of time on the swings.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.640]   I don't think, like, they went to play around there.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.440]   It's kind of legendary, you know.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.720]   Yeah, there's a playground in South Park.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.440]   You know, we went and got the burritos at the burrito place and sat down.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.520]   It's since been, I think, remodeled.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.520]   Oh.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.840]   But so I don't remember that specific conversation.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.400]   I remember that we had lots of conversations.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:06.720]   I do remember that we had a video of Twitter being demoed when it was six hours old.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   Wow.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:13.920]   And because YouTube wasn't around, we just shared it on the local file system, on the
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.280]   local network, because we had no other way to share a video.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.320]   And we've all lost that video.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.320]   Oh.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.160]   Like the demo video of Twitter at six hours old.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.280]   It's probably sitting on someone's laptop and someone's garage.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.800]   And, you know, there's an email from Eb saying, download the demo video.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.840]   It's here, you know, here's the, here it is on my file system.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.520]   Make a copy.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:43.720]   Here from the Wayback Machine is a flicker image of Twitter back when it was TWTTR.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.560]   There was no, there were no vowels.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.440]   And the question was, what are you doing?
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.160]   That stayed for a long time.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.080]   And then there's the field.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.400]   And then these are quote your people, the people you're, you're following here, you
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.160]   know, including a lot of the names we all know.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.480]   Um, is it.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.280]   Of course, I was meant to replace your message every time in the earliest iteration.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:13.480]   This iteration were those messages archived or did they in fact disappear?
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.680]   They were always archived.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680]   Okay.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.360]   You could, you could always see a history of it, you know, because we saw it as microblogging.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.800]   We saw it as, you know, lighter and easier and faster than normal blogging, you know,
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:34.840]   making posts that people wouldn't, wouldn't care about like writing something more substantial.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.560]   So you were there at the birth of Twitter.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560]   Really?
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.560]   Absolutely.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.760]   Um, was there a sense as you're, as you're doing this that this is going to be?
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.520]   Because I remember, you know, at this time there was a lot of stuff going on.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.440]   People were trying a lot of different things in this social idea.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   There was dodge ball.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:03.600]   Remember dodge ball and, uh, you know, I think right around then, uh, we started posting
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.720]   our location everywhere we went.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.960]   Uh, who's the mayor?
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   I was the mayor of a lot of places.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   What's the name of that program now?
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.160]   I'm drawing a blank.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.160]   It's amazing.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   This wasn't that long ago.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160]   For sure.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.720]   So dodge ball went.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:25.080]   So I liked it was acquired by Google and then they quit and founded for square.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   Yep.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.080]   For horse.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   Square.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.160]   I really liked dodge ball and then I when four square came along was it was at South
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.400]   by that everybody started using that and, uh, and that was very exciting.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.280]   And for many years, I now in hindsight, it looks incredibly stupid and naive.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.320]   I would automatically post my location as I went everywhere.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.480]   Oh, it's sweet.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   It's nice.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.200]   I remember Robert that we were having a nice lunch somewhere.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.480]   Robert Scoble shows up.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.080]   I said, Robert, how do you do that?
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   Well, that's scary.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   I said, what are you doing here?
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.480]   I was following you on dodge ball and here I am.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.040]   Uh, it was naive.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   It was very naive.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.880]   That was, uh, that was a different time.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.560]   There was also Jaikou and Pounce and Gawala and there was a ton of others.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.920]   You know, Scoble was the first Twitter influencer.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.560]   He actually at one point he had 3000 followers and it broke the site when he tweeted.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.480]   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.480]   He was so proud.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   He was so proud.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.200]   I got to, uh, I got to, uh, I was at 5000 followers at one point, which was the most
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.960]   at that time and then, uh, Kevin Rose and I got in a battle over who could have be number
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:40.120]   one and then some guy named Ashton Kutcher came along and I can only imagine what that
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.480]   did to the servers.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:50.200]   Now at, at one point, you know, now years later and over time custom database servers and
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.840]   a ton of code was written to schedule, you know, bake it work in a real time and some
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.880]   of the features were dropped.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:03.360]   But there was at one point where if the servers crashed during the day San Francisco time,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:10.160]   there was no way to get the caches hot again until the night.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:18.720]   So it was just like, if it was down midday, it was going to stay down until everybody
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.120]   went to sleep.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.760]   So how long were you at Twitter?
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.080]   How long did you stay there?
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.800]   So I was there from 2004 when we started ODO through the middle of 2006.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.280]   You know, we started the first prototypes of Twitter from February 2006 and the version
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.880]   we have now launched in March.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:43.640]   And I didn't think it was going anywhere and Caterina fake and Stuart Butterfield recruited
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.880]   me to go over to work at Yahoo.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:56.080]   They were purchased by Yahoo and they were building a team and Yahoo seemed like a more
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.600]   stable, better funded thing.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.120]   And I like the flicker folks.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.640]   Who was CEO Yahoo though?
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.600]   I don't even remember.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   There was so many.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.040]   Was Jerry still or was he gone by then?
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:18.400]   No, he was he was still there because we went in and pitched Yahoo to buy Twitter.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.640]   It was Terry Semel.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   Wow.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.640]   Terry Semel.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.880]   And so Terry Semel.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:33.120]   Yeah, offered $25 million to buy Twitter and Jack countered saying I want $100 million.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:38.400]   And like last year I was talking to Eve about it and he was like, no way, we were never
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.000]   going to sell.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.800]   Just I thought I should do the meetings.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.200]   But was that because he really thought it was going somewhere that it was worth more
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.000]   than $100 million and we'll never sell this?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   No.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.040]   I think he just didn't want to be acquired again.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   He'd been through it.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   Yeah, he'd been through it.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.880]   He'd been through it.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.480]   And the the blogger team hated being at Google.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.800]   Google didn't get blogger.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.440]   They didn't get social.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.120]   Social folks didn't like the Google.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.000]   It's a miracle still alive.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.960]   Yeah, I'm I'm amazed that Google hasn't shut it down because.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.960]   Let's not tell them.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.800]   They forgot about it.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.840]   It really looks like the land that time forgot.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.840]   It looks ancient.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840]   It is.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:28.240]   The Google engineers that were assigned a blogger hated it.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:35.520]   They wanted to work on like big data and Google search and all these like hard engineering
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.160]   problems and the blogger team is like, let's make people connect.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.600]   In a way, that's still the problem at Google, right?
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.800]   It's not if it's not sexy.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   It's still there.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   No, the blogger is I know.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800]   The blogger still there.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.760]   It's kind of the generic problem with Google, which is if it ain't sexy, we don't you know,
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.160]   we're not going to maintain an old product.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.160]   That's the last thing I want to do.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.120]   I'm a Googler, man.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.320]   So you you went to.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   I, you know, I was a friend of your GX.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.560]   They started Jiku.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.920]   I love Jiku.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.640]   I was always looking for the next thing.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.360]   I remember when was it Ariel who started Pounce?
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.880]   I remember when Pounce started.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.280]   There were so many interests.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.960]   This was a very vital space and it was all inspired by Twitter, but it was trying different
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   stuff.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:29.000]   Jiku had threaded conversations for instance, which is something Twitter never did.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.880]   Yeah, Jiku was amazing and there was a whole sort of renaissance of it and there was this
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   idea that maybe this Web 2.0 thing should be based on these open APIs and we should
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.080]   collaborate and we should make these standards.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:51.040]   And now we're 15 years later having the same conversations.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.960]   We're more siloed than we were back then, I think, really.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.960]   Was Jiku.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.960]   You were very open.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.960]   Was Jiku XMPP?
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.960]   I think it was, wasn't it?
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.200]   So Jiku was XMPP, but Twitter was also XMPP.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   Oh, really?
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:11.240]   So you could like the first Twitter API was both REST and XMPP.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:18.160]   So we gave a talk at the O'Reilly open source conference about how to build APIs over XMPP
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:25.240]   and we got Federation just like Masterdong works now between Jiku and Twitter going and
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.800]   on this API.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:33.080]   But XMPP didn't scale well for his API, not the way REST does.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:40.240]   And so when Twitter started having scaling problems, the XMPP API was dropped.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.480]   Scaling was of course the big issue on Twitter for a long time, the fail whale and all of
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.480]   that.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.160]   It was originally Ruby on Rails project.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.480]   Which was great for the first version.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.480]   Sure.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.200]   In fact, that's what Rails is great, right?
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   MVP.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   Get it out the door.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.880]   It's, you know, you first line a code.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.280]   It's running code.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   It's running.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.800]   You know, so it really feels good.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.240]   But obviously it's not an ideal solution for scaling.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.520]   Were you there in the attempts to scale?
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.200]   I was there in the attempts to scale.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:17.120]   At some point I, you know, moved across the street, but, you know, over to Yahoo Brick
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.120]   House.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.720]   But I think I had root on all the servers and was doing code commits for until 2008.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.720]   What?
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   Wow.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.080]   See, mud was right.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.840]   Holy cow.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   Oh.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.120]   Twitter security was really good by the time mud showed up.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   Oh, compared to the previous.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.320]   The root password on all the servers was the company name in the year it was found.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.800]   Oh my God.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   Jeez.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:52.640]   So you can remote SSH in to root with the password, ODO 2005.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.640]   What?
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.640]   And get in.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:00.800]   And that was also the password for subversion so you can commit code.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:08.080]   And there were commit hooks on subversion that would auto deploy anything in the, in
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.760]   subversion to production tests and things.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:17.880]   So like at one point I was at a conference in Dublin and I'm like, I can't see at replies.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.760]   Like I can't see mentions in the mobile thing.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:27.880]   And I just like open up the code and added it and pushed it and it just auto deploys.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.080]   You weren't working there at the time.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.880]   This was, this was like two years after I quit.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   Oh my God.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   Oh my God.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   Was that a naive?
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.560]   Hey, was it, I don't understand why they didn't have better sec ops.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.800]   I mean, this is not important.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.480]   I don't even use passwords from my SSH.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.400]   I can't believe they did.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.040]   Let alone Twitter, 2004.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.720]   Our chief engineer says, be right back.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   I'm changing to its passwords right now.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720]   That's right.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.840]   I don't even know what to say.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.320]   Like I was not on the operations server side of things.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.840]   I was not one of the admins, but.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.840]   That's amazing.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.520]   You know, that's amazing.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.320]   Obviously this is great for you because this is a, this is part of the learning curve.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.360]   You, you in on somebody else's time, you really get to see what works, what doesn't
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.360]   work.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.800]   And I'm sure you're sitting there as a talented engineer thinking, you know, this could be
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.280]   done a little bit better.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.520]   Were you feeling that way?
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:43.640]   Well, so at one point, there was a very heated argument between the engineering team at early
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.800]   Twitter and the ops team.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.680]   And you know, rumor has it that chairs were thrown in the meeting room.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.680]   Oh my God.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.800]   Everybody insists no chairs were thrown.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.760]   They were just kicked over.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:05.400]   But there, there was some very heated debates about this stuff because, you know, the servers
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   were going down.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.320]   Everyone was blaming each other.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.520]   Everyone was trying to keep it up.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:16.600]   And you know, frankly, the security in the ops system wasn't up to the task of what,
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   what was needed.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:27.120]   So how long did you stay at Flickr that I stayed at I stayed at Flickr for Yahoo for for two
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.240]   years until Valley WAG wrote an article saying I was working remotely from Uruguay and Yahoo
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.240]   fired me.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.240]   Oh, man.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.000]   Oh, man.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.840]   You were so much ahead of your time.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.840]   All right.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.840]   We're you're not are you in Uruguay?
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.040]   No, you're in New Zealand now.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   Yes.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   I'm in New Zealand now.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   Nice.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   So you've always been a little parapetetic.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   Yeah, must be late at night, right?
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   No, it's 10 30 in the morning.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   Oh, it's early morning.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040]   Okay.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.040]   Well, that's right.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   That's right.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   But it's my, it's my Thursday.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040]   But it's tomorrow.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   Yeah, it's morning tomorrow.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   All right.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   Let's let's keep going through the press.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.040]   Why did you work on it?
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   I'm from Uruguay.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.040]   So I worked on this.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.360]   Well, one, we got Yahoo to adopt OAuth because, you know, I don't know if people remember
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.320]   OAuth, the ability to like log in with Twitter, Yahoo, everything else.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:20.240]   That came out of Twitter, actually, and Flickr not wanting to share people's passwords.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   Right.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.400]   So I got Yahoo to the security auto, and then we launched this thing called Fire Eagle,
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.240]   which was a location sharing brokerage.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   Totally remember that.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   Yes.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.240]   I remember that.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   Yes.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   Wonderful.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:40.400]   So was that inspired by Dodgeball and Four Square or was it?
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   Absolutely.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.340]   It was like Dodgeball and Four Square is one thing, but like, what if we could work more
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.640]   on the phone level, get your location, and then share it out, but fuzzed for different
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   applications?
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.160]   So one would just be like, this is where I am, you know, show me what city I'm in and
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.960]   another application could know your exact location, and rather than each application
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.840]   directly acting the phone where you are, you could ask a privacy layer that would let
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.600]   you see what data you were passing out.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:17.640]   It actually was a good idea, but probably needed to be on the phone OS level, not a Yahoo
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.640]   service.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.320]   But it used OAuths and it was in Iraq.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.320]   Yep.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.280]   And it was secure in Iraq.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   So it was really ahead.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.920]   I mean, it was actually a little bit ahead of its time, frankly.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.320]   And we did some neat privacy things where the, though, if you weren't logged in or you didn't
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.200]   have an active session, you couldn't match a user's location with their identity.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.560]   So we had some like fun cryptography first, some like, Xillowar knowledge proofs and stuff
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.560]   like that.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.560]   Oh, how cool.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.800]   That meant that if someone came and got a copy of Yahoo's database of everything, they
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.280]   would know who was in the database and where people were, but not who was where.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.400]   I very much remember using Fire Eagle and thinking, this is really cool.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.880]   And you could use your location on moveable type or on another tools.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.720]   It was a really, really clever.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.720]   I remember that.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   Yes.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.720]   Uh, implementation.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.320]   And again, I'm that naive guy who has been all along posting location every five minutes
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.080]   everywhere I go.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.400]   So I didn't see any issue with location, but it sounds like, uh, Rabble, you've always
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   been kind of aware of even back then when no one else was certainly I wasn't of privacy
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.240]   and security issues.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.040]   Like, uh, did you, were you already thinking this, this could be a problem going forward?
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.040]   Of course.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.200]   You know, and, and they were, they were debates in early Twitter days.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.440]   Like, can you at reply anybody?
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:48.080]   You know, by that point, by the time that replies and that highlighting got added, I
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.600]   wasn't on the team anymore, but Blaine was there.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.280]   He built the original Twitter API.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.320]   He built, you know, added support for at replies and, you know, basically everything in early
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.240]   Twitter, Blaine built.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.440]   And he was like, no way should you be able to at reply anybody.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.720]   You should only be able to at reply people that you have a social connection with already.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   Interesting.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.160]   And Twitter is finally coming back around to that, by the way, which is interesting.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.040]   Other folks on the team were like, Oh, no, we need.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:23.800]   We need this thing because we need to be able to get that kind of viral growth and open
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.640]   and what, what bad thing could happen with someone at replying you.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.680]   Uh, ask me, uh, ask me all about that.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.440]   I have a lot to say about that replies.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.240]   Um, actually I haven't read an at reply in ages.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.400]   I come to think of it for that reason.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.920]   It's, uh, it's a way you can, you can, you know, throw poop out of your monkey cage at
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.320]   anybody as they go by.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.920]   Um, so you, so that's interesting because that was not the focus of Twitter.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.720]   The focus of Twitter at the time was growth more than anything else.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:00.920]   Well, the focus of the Twitter was not even trying to drive growth.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.680]   The growth focus of Twitter in those early days was just keep up surviving it.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.680]   Surviving it.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.640]   Um, and then, you know, a business model will come in the future.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.800]   Everything, you know, it was just keep the lights on.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   Right.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.120]   Don't, don't repeat the mistake of Friendster.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   Yes.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.080]   And what would you, what would you mark as the core mistake of Friendster?
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.320]   The Friendster was having trouble scaling.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.320]   They couldn't scale.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   Right.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.320]   They couldn't scale.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.440]   And instead of slowly working on iterating this, I ended up actually working with the
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.160]   lead engineer Ian McFarland from Friendster a few years later.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:46.360]   Instead of taking parts of Friendster and replacing it, they did a monolithic rewrite
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.880]   for two years and rewrote the whole thing in Java and finally got a version of the scale.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.400]   But by then their users were gone.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   Right.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400]   Right.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   Right.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   Right.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400]   Right.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   Right.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   Right.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.400]   Right.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.720]   So, uh, have said, said to me once, um, that when Twitter started, there was no vision of
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:09.680]   it being this, uh, um, axle for news, the people to report news that there was a moment
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.720]   kind of when they said, Oh, hell, everybody's going to say what's going on around them.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.680]   Geez, this is the new wire service, the new news.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.120]   When did that kind of realization come of the Twitter was more than saying I'm in the
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.120]   bar?
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.440]   That was a few years in, like it was definitely after I left.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:32.360]   Um, and it was, you know, there was an idea that Twitter should be used by celebrities
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.200]   and that it would be good for people who had an audience.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.520]   And we sent Adam, Adam Rugel, who was our sort of biz dev guy down to Los Angeles to
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.420]   find a celebrity used Twitter.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.800]   And the only person he could find to join Twitter was the assistant script writer for
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.360]   my name is Earl.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   That, that was Twitter's first celebrity from Hollywood.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:03.200]   Oh, how far they come.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:09.440]   And there was even an attempt in the early years to sponsor the MTV music video words,
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.840]   which also didn't get any engagement.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.520]   Like people didn't get it.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:22.000]   I do remember though, at some point seeing at signs in the credits of shows and into lower
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.080]   thirds at us, it really did start to gain currency.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.880]   And that I think probably more than anything else brought Twitter to the mainstream.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.600]   South by was 2007, right?
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.760]   What it would have took a South by was South by was 2007.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.160]   And it wasn't accidental.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.880]   Like Twitter rented screens and put them throughout the hallways at South by and built
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.320]   a custom app to display tweets from South by really at the event.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:55.720]   So, you know, here on Twitch, we have this IRC back channel, but what, what the point
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:04.280]   of Twitter at South by was was to basically move that back channel into Twitter and make
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   it visible.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.280]   Yeah, it was great.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.280]   It was great.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   Do you have an adult, adult session?
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.160]   Who's in a good one?
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   Right?
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.480]   So you're unemployed in Uruguay.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   What then?
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.320]   Drinking a lot of urban mite no doubt.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:25.640]   So I'm unemployed in Uruguay and a, you know, I hang out there.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.880]   I open a co-working space from a Ruby conference, do things like that.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:40.840]   And eventually, Joe Ito reaches out and I join a project to build a sort of a pivotal
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:49.160]   labs lean startup type studio with, with Joe Ito and Eric Reese and Ian McFarland,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.680]   who had been CTO of Friendster and then went over to Pivotal.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.440]   And you know, we tried to build a new product innovation lab.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.160]   So I did that for a couple of years.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.800]   Was it was a joy at a media lab, MIT's media lab at the time or was this pre pre that?
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.320]   Now this was before he was at media.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.760]   Then I followed him to the media lab.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.760]   Okay.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   And you were a media lab.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   Cool.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:16.120]   And I was at the center for civic media group at the media lab because by this point, Twitter
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.280]   had become a big deal.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.600]   Social media had become a big deal.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:26.880]   And I went and tried to understand what had happened and how to do it better.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.880]   Yes.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:32.720]   And also Twitter, by this point, had shut down its open API ecosystem.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.760]   And that was a huge thing.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.400]   And that was the thing that inspired me to try and do something new because as long as
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:45.280]   Twitter had its API ecosystem, it wasn't a protocol, but it worked like that.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.480]   You could go build your own thing.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.880]   So that's interesting.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.080]   So what's the distinction between a protocol and an API?
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.360]   An API is hosted, right?
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   So I have the API, a protocol everybody can use.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.320]   Is that the chief difference?
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.320]   That's the main difference.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.360]   I mean, if you were developing a Twitter app, you would just connect to the Twitter servers.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.360]   And originally--
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.360]   There was all those--
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.600]   The Twitter-ific apps.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.600]   Yep.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   Yep.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.840]   You would just put your Twitter username and password in there.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:23.040]   And we thought that that was terrible because people were using passwords and you didn't
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.760]   have to trust these apps.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.960]   So that's where OAuth comes from.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.960]   Okay.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   Which let you register the apps.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   Right.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.920]   And then your authentication stuff stays in Twitter.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:41.880]   The thing we didn't realize was that we're using OAuth protected users, but it also shifted
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.160]   the power from the app developers who were originally just--
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.440]   They needed users consent because you just username, password, and you access the Twitter
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:56.640]   servers to Twitter and Facebook and others being able to control the apps that are in
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.200]   their ecosystem.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.640]   Right.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.640]   So I still--
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.680]   Which is how Twitter shut it down.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.000]   How do-- doing what?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Turning off the API.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.320]   Or limiting it.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.160]   You can only have 100,000 API keys.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   Right.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   Yep.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   So remember--
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   So we all remember that.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.320]   Some of our favorite clients, you know, they couldn't add new members because they'd
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.440]   used up all their keys and so forth.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.720]   And it was really the beginning of then.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.400]   And of course, you've talked about this before, Jeff, because you were friends with Bill Gross.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.080]   And that really put the kibosh on Bill's ambitions.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   Yes, exactly.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   Well, he tried to--
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   --buy every one of them.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.600]   The Bill Gross story is super fascinating.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.880]   He's the first billionaire-- or I don't know if he's actually a billionaire.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.960]   But it's first, like, person who said, "Twitter's a show.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.840]   I'm going to do something about it."
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.800]   And he had this thing, Uber Media.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   And--
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.400]   I bet you'll just go drive to the investor at Uber Media.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.000]   And I don't know what happened to Uber Media recently.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:05.880]   But the idea was to buy up the Twitter clients and then be able to have people cross post
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:12.960]   and have a site that didn't crash and then maybe had a business model and Dick Costello
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.440]   and the Twitter, you know, Ryan Sarver, who was running their platform, stuff, they all
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:24.120]   freaked out and shut down their open ecosystem, bought TweetDeck, like basically--
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.120]   Underbilled stuff.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   --land to war against--
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.960]   Right.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:38.200]   They went to war against Bill Gross and kept the ecosystem, but they, you know, they killed
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.880]   the-- they destroyed the village to save it.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   Absolutely.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:48.520]   And you know what's interesting, Rebel, is that Bill didn't do it because he was rapacious.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.480]   He did it because he loved Twitter.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:55.520]   He saw that Twitter had such potential and it killed him every time the veil wheel went
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:01.120]   up and it killed him that you couldn't expand enough.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.720]   So he was going to show the way and create-- his main goal was to create monetization.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   But yeah, then it got brought-- the rug got pulled up underneath him.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.920]   And you know, this was my argument with Ryan Sarver.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.880]   He's a VC now, but he was running platform at Twitter time.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:24.280]   Like I thought what Twitter should do was make the app developers revenue partners in
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   this.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:30.720]   And the Twitter team was like, oh no, we can't run ads through third parties because we don't
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.240]   know if they will cheat the system or everything else.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.840]   And it was like, instead of making these third party developers people who could make money
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:44.680]   with Twitter off of the ads that were consumed on their apps, Twitter saw them as an antagonistic
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.440]   thing and fought against them.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.880]   And a tremendous amount of goodwill was burned there.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.880]   Amen.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.880]   Two questions.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.120]   Two questions related to that.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.520]   And I'll list two possible errors in those days.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.400]   One was, Jack said it shouldn't have been a company.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.440]   It should have been a protocol.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.440]   He said that recently.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   He said it recently, right?
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.840]   Or the other one is Twitter should have kept the APIs open and done what you just said.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.480]   Once your should have would have could have for Twitter, both four to have succeeded then
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.280]   and four to be safer now.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.400]   I mean, I think those are both true.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:30.360]   I think that Twitter, by the time Evan Jack had left everybody at Twitter forgot where
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.120]   Twitter's innovation came from.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.680]   And so they thought that Twitter, the company had done it.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.520]   But Twitter, the phrase was always, Twitter is too important for Twitter to the company
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.760]   to run.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.680]   And Twitter never did any of its innovation.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:50.120]   The app replies in search and hashtags and inline links and images and video and tweet
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:57.800]   streams and Twitter space, everything came from third party developers in the community.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:05.560]   And so what, the biggest problem was Twitter lost its open API, it lost its protocol, and
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:10.640]   it lost the idea that innovation is coming from the edges.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:17.520]   So let's fast forward to today because that's, I take it kind of the inspiration for Scuttle
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.960]   Butt, which is a protocol.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.760]   You written or your team has written?
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   I work on it.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   Okay.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.680]   So it's an open protocol, others are working on it as well.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:38.600]   And your planetary, which is your currently iOS only, I don't want to say Twitter clone,
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:45.760]   instantiation of Scuttle Butt, aka Twitter clone, is based on Scuttle Butt.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:52.000]   And as a result, confederate with other Scuttle Butt services.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.160]   Is that how it works?
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:01.360]   So Scuttle Butt's actually appeared, appeared, it doesn't use federated servers as intermediaries.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:06.800]   So what, what I and a bunch of the other people, you know, this is myself.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:13.440]   This is your learnings though from all these years of turmoil with social media.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:21.880]   Basically, all of the early engineers at Twitter and for the first couple of generations, like
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.440]   the idea of it being more protocol and more platform waste and looked at how to, how to
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.680]   build this.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:32.280]   And I and, and playing cook and a bunch of other people were looking at emerging technologies
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:38.160]   and we tried to build it on top of BitTorrent and zero net and IPFS and kept playing with
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.160]   it.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:45.040]   And I came to a conference here in New Zealand and met this hacker who lives off the grid
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:50.280]   on a sailboat, Dominic Tarr, and he had built this social protocol called Scuttle Butt.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.520]   And I'm like, Hey, this is super interesting except that you have to compile your own clients.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:01.320]   What if we added a really great product person and made this more accessible?
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:09.480]   So I went back to Tom Coates who I worked with on Fire Eagle and was the person that Ev desperately
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:15.760]   wanted to be the lead designer at ODO and, and Twitter, but wasn't able to recruit.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.600]   And I told Tom and like, Tom, what do you think we do?
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:24.000]   We start this company where we, we, we create this and we, we design it.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.040]   And the community said, yes, they want us to commercialize their protocol.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.400]   And some of the investors said, yes, you know, I believe in this original vision.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:39.400]   And, you know, what, what I didn't realize is how hard the tech would be to build it.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.640]   Cause it's, you know, I'm now four years into it.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.240]   And, and finally we have an app that feels decent.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   So this is interesting.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:52.520]   So I run a street, for instance, a mastodon server, which is essentially based on activity
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:41:00.840]   pub via GNU social and identical and Evan prodromo and, you know, there's a long history.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.480]   But the idea is you run a server, you could run a server just for yourself, but that's
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.880]   kind of a heavyweight thing to do.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:10.960]   But you can run a server and then you can put stuff up on the, on the, you know, you,
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   you can tune it as we say in, in mastodon ease.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.840]   And, and others can follow you from any other server.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.960]   It's federated.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.000]   So that's kind of the, I understand the federated notion.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.280]   In fact, my first question to you when we started emailing is, well, why didn't you,
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.320]   why didn't you do something on activity pub?
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.800]   As activity pub and activity streams are super interesting.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:39.960]   They were an attempt to open up Twitter and attempt to sort of revive that vision of Twitter,
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.440]   which had been federated briefly and make it real.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.080]   But activity pub has a, of a few problems.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.560]   One, they never really addressed the issue of verifying content.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.840]   Like who did this thing?
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.880]   You have to trust the federated nodes.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.280]   There's no way to move between one federated node and another.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:03.800]   So if I want to, you know, say, oh, I, you know, if mastodon dot social gets deleted and
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.880]   disappears, then everyone who knows that I'm rabble at mastodon dot social loses track
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.880]   of me.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.480]   I lose track of them.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:17.400]   And there's no way for me to have private messages either individually or in a group
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.040]   between people between servers.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.440]   So you have to completely trust whoever's running your server there.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:31.040]   And so there's a privacy problem with that, but also it means that you can't just do new
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.600]   message types very easily.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.000]   You can't build new kinds of applications.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.080]   So on schedule, but you can play a game of chess or we have a clone of GitHub or, you
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.440]   know, there's a, a recipe share.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.920]   It's, you know, you can build any kind of social app on top of it.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:50.840]   Now what planetary does is a pretty traditional social feed type thing where you can link
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.240]   between data and collaborate, but there are a lot of different ones.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:03.040]   And you know, planetary is a iOS app, but there are Firefox plugins and there's miniverse,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.800]   which is an Android app and iOS app.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:10.960]   So and you can take your account, your crypto, you have a keys and go from the planetary app
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.160]   and put it in any of those other apps.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.960]   And then you get different algorithms and different feeds and that's structure of what
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.400]   kind of data you're playing.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.800]   So right now, so when that's critical, that's great.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.760]   Because when Mastodon that technology is shutting down is a big massive on server.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.160]   A lot of people are migrating and you can migrate, but you have to tell everybody, this
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.400]   is my new fully qualified address.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.840]   I now live here.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.840]   It's a complicated process.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.880]   And you really, you're right.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.480]   You're not really taking everything with you.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.920]   All I take now is my key is a public private key system.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:42.920]   Is that what it is?
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.280]   Yeah, it's an ED 25519 key.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.040]   It's the same, you know, you know, you're laughing, but that's the best key.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.800]   That's the key I use for my SSH, by the way, instead of.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:44:00.240]   You know, you know, you know, you know, 2004 I use an ED to two one nine five nine.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.000]   So okay, so you have a key and by the way, you don't know.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you don't care.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:12.800]   It's super small and you know, you have, you know, you can, we have these identity servers.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.760]   So like you can go to rabble.nz and it'll take you to find me.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.560]   But my actual identity is this key that exists on this peer to peer network.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.560]   It works offline.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.280]   I don't even have to have an internet connection.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:29.280]   If two phones that have the app or laptop and a phone are in the same place, they'll
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.200]   start sinking directly without any internet connection at all.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   Wow.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:40.040]   We've done experiments with a Scuttlebutt nodes that sit on the back of trucks that work
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.720]   by NGOs that drive between villages in Brazil and in Africa.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.760]   Oh, that's really important.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.400]   Oh, sync to people's phones.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.400]   There's no Wi-Fi.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.960]   There's no cell phone service.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   Huge.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.400]   Everything you go down, the protocol keeps working.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.880]   So it's fully distributed.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:00.200]   You know, I for a long time, I use a key base account to kind of as a proof of identity.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.400]   Same kind of the idea, but they had to host it.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.840]   People had to know I was there.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.160]   This way, I can keep my own keys.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:15.240]   Do you run something locally or do you choose a server or does it matter?
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.280]   You run something locally.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.640]   So in Planetaries case, either on the Mac because we're desktop app to or in your phone
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:26.280]   or your iPad, it stores your keys in your Apple key chain and it gets backed up on the
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.280]   iPad.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.280]   Okay.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   Okay.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.360]   And then it's a, you know, speaking of key base, did you know that there's a keys.com
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:38.880]   pub, which is one of the key base guys who's gone and rewritten key base, but based on
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.880]   modern technology.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.880]   Oh, hello.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.880]   Two, five, five, one, nine keys.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:47.320]   Key base was a sad story of a wonderful site that got bought by Yahoo.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.320]   Zoom, rather.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.600]   It's almost as bad as Yahoo.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.320]   And it's still there.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.320]   So this is though.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.640]   So he kept it alive.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.640]   Okay.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.680]   So this is, I'm not sure exactly who it is, but some of the key base people have gone off
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.840]   and built this thing, keys.pub, which is a rewrite of key base, which it needed because
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.040]   it has legacy.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.040]   It's fantastic.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.880]   There's not a large ecosystem around it yet, but I'm super excited about it because, because
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.800]   it lets us do that thing we could do with key base.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.480]   So can this interoperate with scuttlebutt somehow?
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.760]   It's on our to do list.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.280]   Cause that would be the goal.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.280]   Right.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.760]   I mean, we've talked about this a lot.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:36.200]   Stacy used to call it the blob where you have a proof of your identity and you can use that
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.200]   everywhere.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.880]   I mean, it's this kind of past keys is sort of trying to do that.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:46.480]   You can use that everywhere, but more importantly, you use that to control your personal information
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.520]   and data and I guess content and anything else you want and keep it.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.520]   It's yours.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:56.480]   You share it in any way you want with anybody else, but it's yours.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.160]   And this really is a solution.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.960]   I don't know if this is what Tim Berners-Lee is thinking about with his ideas, but this
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.760]   is really the solution is for you to own your data.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   Your vault.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   Your vault.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   And, and solid, which is Tim Berners, the new thing is one of the ways that we're working
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.760]   on it.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:20.200]   The other thing that the other major insight that I got working on this is that the data
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.400]   isn't the most important thing.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.560]   Like the reason Instagram and Twitter, you know, even Tinder lets you download all of
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.280]   your data is because that's fine.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.120]   The data isn't the valuable thing.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.000]   The connection between people and the ability to connect to them, address them and find
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.280]   them is the important thing.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:45.040]   And so that's the thing we need to protect and also make sure are in the hands of users.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.400]   So, so rebel, Leo, it's Theo show this is not a democracy.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.400]   No, no, no, no, I want you to ask your questions.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.960]   I want to put something out here.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:56.080]   I want to jump ahead to come back where I want to end up with this conversation.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.920]   There's so much to go here, but, but it's two things.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:05.080]   One, I'm eager to hear your views of blue sky and what they've just announced and how
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:10.120]   that fits into the ecosystem where does not point one and then point two with whatever
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:15.040]   the ecosystem, scuttlebutt planetary blue sky at all.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:20.480]   If, if Elon Musk with his sink that he took into the lobby today, flushes all of Twitter
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:26.000]   down the drain and there's kind of disaster disaster bat signal.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.320]   And that's, that's, that's what that was with the discussion was with Mike Masnick and
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.200]   Daphne Keller was, Oh my God, what do we do?
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.800]   Who's in a position to do something bat signal?
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   Rebel.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:44.360]   So I'm eager to hear you, whatever order your vision for what could be an alternative
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.440]   and what that looks like and what does it mean to interoperate and what does it mean
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.640]   to get our social graphs, what does it mean to hold on to those connections and so on.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.640]   And then how these things fit together or don't.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.640]   So absolutely.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:03.560]   So for folks that don't know, blue sky is a independent public benefit corporation that
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:09.960]   was funded a couple years ago, or proposed a couple years ago and funded last year.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:17.400]   It's got $13 million of investment from Twitter, but it's, uh, Jack is the chair of the board
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.400]   of blue sky.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.000]   It's an independent organization.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.560]   And the goal is basically to follow through with Mike Masnick's article of, of protocols
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.560]   not platform.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   Right.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.240]   That Twitter should be a protocol.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.360]   We should make something less like Twitter as a protocol.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.920]   And then people could build on top of it.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.280]   That's something that I've advocated.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:44.200]   It's something that Jack advocated early on that didn't end up happening.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:51.480]   I, you know, I went into to, to Jack and Biz and pitched planetary before we were announced
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:56.040]   to raise before blue sky existed and say, look, we need to do this protocol thing.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.360]   And there was this giant debate with Twitter lawyers about whether or not, uh, they were
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.280]   allowed to invest and whether or not Twitter was allowed to invest and Biz ended up investing,
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.200]   but Jack didn't.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.600]   And but the idea stuck and it's a good idea.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.400]   And, and first it's, you know, blue sky is small.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.080]   They're a three person team.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.080]   Right.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:25.080]   It's, you know, Dan, Paul and Jay, uh, Jay and Paul were both scuttlebutt developers.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:30.000]   Uh, Paul also worked on the DAT protocol and worked on the beaker browser.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.920]   Um, Dan was working on IPFS stuff with this company called fission codes.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:42.520]   Like they're all great folks and they're doing great work, but it's a teeny team.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.760]   And I'm super excited about where that protocol is going.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:52.640]   Now there's some design differences that are between scuttlebutt and planet, you know,
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.160]   and the app protocol, which are a little different.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:02.560]   The app protocol is uses keys and sign logs and a lot of the tech is the same, but it
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.480]   uses relay servers.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:09.200]   But unlike the FETI versus relay servers, you have a root key, which you can move your
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.040]   identity from one server to the other.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:17.720]   So you know, it, it, it inverts the control, which I think is the important thing there.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:25.000]   And it then has a space for not all of the feed algorithms and the spam stuff happening
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.600]   on device, but you can outsource it to cloud services.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.920]   Say, you know, I want to use Twitter's recommendation algorithm, or I want to use planetary's
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:39.320]   recommendation algorithm, or I want to use, you know, right, you know, open AI's recommendation
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.960]   algorithm, or I can start a whole new company to make a right, just be in the business of
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.360]   recommendations, and you can pay me for it, right?
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.360]   Exactly.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   Or, you know, and so I'm super excited about the, the app protocol that's coming out of
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   it.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:59.840]   I've been, you know, I've been involved with blue sky, not as an employee, but as a,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.520]   you know, a collaborator since before it was announced.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:10.520]   And this, you know, it's a, it's a great team of people, but it's a teeny team that's work,
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:16.320]   you know, it's based on the idea that don't get big fast, get a small group of people
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.920]   who have a long history of being able to figure this stuff out and work on it and build something
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.920]   interesting.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.920]   But we have an immersion.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   Unfortunately, for.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   Yes.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.240]   Well, I, I wish that we growing a little bit faster, but I also wish that planetary was
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.240]   going faster.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.680]   Every time something comes in the news, I'm like, why, you know, why haven't I solved
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.000]   that memory leak problem?
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:42.440]   And why, you know, you know, scuttle that has two feed encoding formats.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.600]   One doesn't let you delete.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.520]   That's terrible.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:52.280]   And like, we haven't, we haven't, you know, we've got the code for the one that lets you
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.320]   delete and the one that lets you do like scalable private groups.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.640]   So you can say everybody who follows me can read my messages, but no one else can.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.960]   But we haven't deployed that yet because this stuff is hard.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:11.680]   How much investment so would either or both of you need to scale into something significant
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:18.240]   to be able to, to, for people to export things into you and continue life?
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:24.360]   I think we need, you know, I think blue skies, $13 million is the right kind of initial investment
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.920]   to get a basic thing working.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.560]   We only raised $1.5 million at planetary.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.080]   You know, $10 million would actually get us there.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.440]   You know, we could have an Android app.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:40.240]   We could have a full web team and we can move forward a lot faster.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.160]   But you know, you, you work with what you've got.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.480]   You know, one of the, one of the tricky things is when I've gone to investors, one, everyone
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.320]   loves to talk to me because they like to hear the Twitter stories and whatnot.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:58.200]   But also they're like, I'm sure you can build the tech, but how do you get the users?
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.840]   You know, how do you get the users in a lockdown ecosystem where Apple and Google control the
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.000]   app stores and make the rules?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.760]   How do you get the users where you've got a few big players?
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.160]   And that's a hard problem.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:17.400]   But my answer is always be that the big players are going to continue to screw up and sell
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:22.800]   themselves to Elon Musk or have, you know, Instagram change it.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:26.000]   So nothing in your feed is somebody you follow.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.240]   And that's going to drive people to look for somebody else.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.160]   But the, the something else has to work.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.120]   And it, and it, and it, what's interesting and maybe who makes it hard to sell is something
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.200]   else is kind of a morphus.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.840]   It could be a variety of different instantiations.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:45.640]   I think the real selling point here is you control your identity and you own your identity.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.880]   And, and your graph.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.880]   And your graph.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.880]   Your connections.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.880]   So the, the graph one is fascinating.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:58.280]   So if we just publish in public all of our contacts and graph and like who we know, that's
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.160]   a terrible idea because it's like spam and privacy and all sorts of stuff.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:07.800]   But the answer to it actually comes out of this thing called private set intersection,
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:15.040]   which was the algorithm that Apple and Google used for their code vid contact tracing app,
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:22.200]   where you can securely check, who do I know in common with you?
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:26.720]   And now that we verified, we know these people in common, I'm going to share with you how
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:29.400]   to get ahold of them on this new network.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   Cool.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:37.760]   And that algorithm of private set intersection, one, it didn't exist when we were doing the
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.800]   original Web 2.0 companies.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:46.880]   But we need that because otherwise, if we just expose everybody's contacts, everyone
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.800]   else, it's going to be disaster.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:53.760]   Facebook is right to protect users by locking down their social graph.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:59.360]   It also gives them a wall garden and is kind of terrible, but they, they aren't wrong about
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.120]   protecting users.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:10.000]   So, so, so, so, Ravel, what can I today, um, export from Twitter?
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.840]   What should I be able to export from Twitter?
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.440]   First part of question, second part of question, what does it take for you to be able to take
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:22.200]   it and let us continue life there?
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:28.040]   So right now you can export from Twitter, you can find your stuff and you get all of
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.800]   your data, but you don't get your follow relationships.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:36.960]   Interestingly enough, the Scuttlebutt app that Jay Graber wrote for Scuttlebutt is an
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:42.040]   app that lets you cross post from Twitter and get your post from Twitter and go into
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.520]   Scuttlebutt.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:48.440]   So that was actually the app she developed, you know, while she was working as a developer
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.760]   at Zcash.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:57.440]   So at the moment, Planetarian Scuttlebutt, it's, you know, it's basically beta quality.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.400]   Like it's funky, there's rough edges.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.280]   There's things that don't sink very well.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:06.400]   You can move over, set up your thing called a room server, which is a shared identity server
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:10.200]   where you can find other people and group a community.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.280]   Think of it a little bit like a, you know, like a master done server, you set that up,
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.240]   you could use it, you could bring together a community.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.280]   That all works.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:22.880]   But, you know, and I think we're ready for early adopters.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.400]   We're ready for explorers.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.840]   We're not ready for that mass market.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:32.480]   And that's my worry is that, you know, the app protocol isn't ready for it.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:41.240]   There's a bunch of other interesting emerging protocols, Pina Panda, Noster, one forecaster
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.240]   just got funding from Anderson Horowitz.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.680]   It's not a bad protocol.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.240]   It's more cryptocurrency focused.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:54.240]   But like, and the thing is, we're all playing with the same Lego pieces.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:58:00.040]   But the question is like, how do we make the Lego piece like, we don't have any kit.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.200]   We don't have any design.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.880]   Like, there's nothing like I'm going to buy the thing that gives me the, you know, the
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.160]   house and the instructions on how to build it.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:11.520]   We're still, we're still building all these cool Lego pieces.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:16.480]   And we need more apps like planetary where you don't, you don't have to understand how
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   the keys work.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.480]   You don't have to understand.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.480]   You don't.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:22.640]   You just go to a web page and click a link and have it connect.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:25.840]   And you don't have to understand how the underlying parts work.
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:31.480]   And to go from, you know, like I can set up my own Bitcoin wallet and run it, you know,
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:37.640]   on the command line to Coinbase is a lot of work.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.720]   Are the right people, it sounds like you're in communication with Jay and company.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.200]   Are the right people talking?
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.960]   So I think a lot of the right people are talking.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:51.800]   We had the decentralized web conference in August that was organized by the Internet
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:58.760]   Archive, another group, Unfinished Live had a pretty decent conference in New York last
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   month.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.440]   They're not collaborating with everyone.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:07.240]   Like, we still lack a bunch of collaboration and we still need to learn from each other
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.720]   better.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:16.200]   And it's not clear if one or any of these emerging protocols will actually succeed.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:25.040]   But I'm, you know, I'm super excited because these protocols say that what we have is a
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.960]   digital public space.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   Yes.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   And that digital public space needs to be run as a commons and owned by various different
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.400]   participants and not run as a shopping mall.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:45.960]   What we have now with Facebook and TikTok and Twitter and Snapchat are shopping malls.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.240]   It feels like a public space.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.320]   It feels like your space, your accounts, your followers.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:57.080]   But the reality is that it's a commercially owned space with opaque rules, no ownership
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.680]   of your social connections or content or your name.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.880]   And those rules change all the time.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.320]   And the worst cases people's accounts get deleted, but usually it's algorithmic manipulation
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.160]   or just not being able to say what you want.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:20.360]   And that doesn't mean like hate speeds, just like you should own the keys to your own house.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.080]   You know, I wonder whether there's a, there's a, there's a development here.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.160]   You look at, let's say podcasts, right?
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.840]   There are pioneers like, like, like Leo there.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.920]   And then companies come in and say, we're going to, you know, Spotify says we're going
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.120]   to take over the space and we're going to love this space.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.480]   And then, and then it gets kind of ruined New York Times and blogs and so on and so on
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.520]   and so on and Twitter and Facebook and so on.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:47.240]   And I think that then it kind of cauterizes the wounds and out of the, out of that can
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.600]   grow new things that have learned the lessons.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:57.200]   And my view is it's a very long, this, this internet thing is a very long term build and
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.760]   this moral phase, yeah, went wrong and people like me were wrong about, about some of the
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.160]   companies here.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.720]   But, but out of that maybe comes a new devotion to saying we're going to make a commons and
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.720]   mean it.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.720]   Well, we've learned lessons, right?
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.920]   Yeah, we had to try these things.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:17.040]   And I think the lesson here, and we're in a way, I think what you're doing is starting
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.560]   over and saying, ah, I got it.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.160]   I get the lessons we've learned.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.600]   So if we were going to do this right, what are the fundamental things we have to solve
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:32.120]   first and then build on that instead of just, you know, it was, it was a crazy time.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.280]   And you know, just cobbling everything together on Ruby on Rails.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.320]   And I, and I, I think the problem is right now what you're doing is infrastructure and
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.800]   it's not obvious even to me, and I think I'm a little sophisticated how to use this and,
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:51.960]   and what it would mean to me and whether it could replace Twitter or Facebook or, or
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.720]   Instagram or any of that stuff.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.360]   And I have faith that it will in a can and it should and I'm, that's more, even more
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.560]   important than anything else that needs to.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.560]   It should.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.280]   This is the, this is the right way to go about doing this.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   Yes.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.080]   And so is that, is that a fair characterization?
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.440]   You're building the infrastructure at this point.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.760]   I mean, we've been building the infrastructure for a bunch of years.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.560]   There's still more infrastructure to build, but we're, you know, if you don't build the
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.000]   infrastructure at the same time that you have people using it and learn from people using
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.720]   it or adapting from it, then you're building the wrong infrastructure.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   Right.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.560]   You know, that's, that's the lesson of Google plus.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.560]   It's like they went and they spent all this time and all this money.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.920]   And then all of a sudden the users didn't use the app and the platform the way they
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.720]   wanted the users to use it.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.520]   And they got in a giant fight with their users and everybody walked away.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.520]   Right.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520]   And then it ate a platform, by the way.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.200]   Well, that's one of the great lessons, as you said from Twitter is that Twitter was best
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.680]   when it let its users forge its direction.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.680]   Absolutely.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.440]   So we're, we're building those pieces.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.040]   We're part of a larger community that's building those pieces.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:01.200]   We need users to be testing it out and playing with it and pushing it forward.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.160]   We obviously need funding in the space.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:09.080]   And, but we also need developers like people coming in and building stuff and saying, okay,
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   this is what works.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.840]   This doesn't, I'm going to build my own thing or I'm going to build on top of other stuff.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:21.000]   We're about to release what we call it ScuttleGo, which is a Go language SDK for building
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.720]   Scuttlebutt applications.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.720]   Nice.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.120]   And I like this.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120]   Is this all Go?
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.040]   The people who've heard of why go.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.280]   Is this all Go?
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.640]   So Scuttlebutt is in a bunch of different languages.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:41.840]   We have implementations in JavaScript, Go, Rust, Elixir, Java, Python, Kotlin, the stuff we
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.760]   use at Planetaries and Go.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.480]   And you know, I don't want to get into an argument about programming languages and stuff
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480]   like that.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.720]   But what we, JavaScript works great in the browser.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.840]   It doesn't work great as a native app.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:03.480]   And so that's why we built it around this open source library that we've released called
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.680]   ScuttleGo.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.280]   So that other people can build their own applications on top of that.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.360]   Once you see how ScuttleGo works, if you want to write it and list, you can.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360]   Exactly.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.280]   You're doing God's work, man.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.280]   Absolutely.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.120]   I really want to support you.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.400]   The problem is you download Planetary and it's immediately obvious what's next, you know,
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.040]   like, and I'm on Android.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.240]   Well, I got Planetary.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240]   I love it.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.040]   It's a beautiful app, by the way.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.080]   It's incredibly well crafted.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.920]   I just don't know what to do with it.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:40.080]   So the next thing we're launching are these things we call name room servers.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.120]   So that's what you need.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.560]   You could like Discord.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.920]   You can register exactly.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:51.120]   So you can register leoliport.planetary.name or whatever domain name you wanted it to be.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.000]   You can share that URL.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.320]   People can see your content.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.320]   There you go.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.200]   What you choose to publish.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.200]   Some of your discussions.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:06.480]   But also, then there's a QR code and a link that will load you up and connect you in any
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.040]   of the ScuttleGo apps.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.040]   Perfect.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.040]   So that they can engage.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.920]   And so that's the thing we're launching next week.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:17.640]   It's been a long road in the process to make that work.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:23.840]   But I'm super excited about that because, you know, if I say, you know, oh, find me on
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:28.280]   Planetarium Scuttle, but my username is at O, capital O, 473.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.760]   You know, I go on for 65 characters.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.280]   No one will ever do it.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.280]   Right.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.520]   QR codes are a good idea.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:42.320]   And I, so really, once we started this club, club twit and we, you know, kind of naively
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:46.520]   stumbled into Discord as the place where we get together.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.280]   And it's turned out this is the social network I always wanted in many respects, except that
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.840]   you don't control the server, you don't control your identity.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.040]   All of these little things that you've been talking about, but the, but the idea of these
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.360]   rooms where you get together, all of this makes a lot of sense.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:05.960]   It's actually a better space to me than Twitter or, or Facebook or anything else.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.960]   I guess it's a little like Facebook groups.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.960]   This makes a lot of that.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.960]   I can understand.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:16.000]   I get my head around, but I also really think it's super important that you own your identity.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.080]   You control your identity.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.280]   You can move around.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:23.080]   I love the idea that there are a variety of clients so you can have it look like you want
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.680]   and behave like you want.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.560]   I think you're really onto something here.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.920]   And the only thing that was missing for me is that one last piece of the, the, you know,
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.400]   the end user interface.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.400]   Like what do I do?
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.080]   Now that I'm here and I think a room is a perfect solution.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.280]   I like that idea.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:42.960]   So I was a, my son is 15 and he's a big gamer and I was talking to him about coming on this
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.880]   show this morning.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:49.720]   And we had this debate about, okay, how is it streaming, Twitch versus discord?
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.360]   This is a big discord user as a gamer.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:59.200]   And what, what we ended up coming up with is like discord is in some ways like Facebook.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.760]   You have to be too way.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.880]   You can't have a, there's no system by which you could have a follower relationship and
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.880]   a broadcast.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.880]   Right.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.160]   And that, that's what made Twitter scale.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:16.960]   And that's what made blog scale and inside the, the scuttlebutt protocol and the app protocol
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:22.560]   that, that blue sky is working on, you need to be able to have both these are the boundaries
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.800]   of the group.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.960]   So the group has these set of rules.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.600]   And also I don't have to listen to you if you want to listen to me.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.320]   I don't have to listen to you.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.320]   Right.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.240]   If you want to listen to me, that's that app reply problem right there.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.160]   I like also what Google plus was going to do right.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.160]   Circles.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.160]   Good.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.400]   Hey, I want to just take a, can we take a little, how much your timeframe, Ravel, do
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.400]   you want to get out of here?
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.400]   Are you done?
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.400]   No, it's the middle of the day.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.400]   I'm fine.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:59.240]   I don't want to keep you from more go, but just take a short break, come back.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.440]   Because I, I think anybody listening now gets a better idea of what you're, what this
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.440]   is all about.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.440]   It's really exciting.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:12.640]   Scuttlebutt.nz is where you can learn about the Scuttlebutt protocol, scuttlebutt.nz.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.320]   And there there is besides a, you know, a lot of information about it.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:21.000]   There are also a link to getting started and a number of different clients, including
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.440]   planetary that you can use in a variety of ways.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:29.480]   And I presume I could set, I have a planetary account, I'm Leo Laporton planetary, that I
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:35.280]   could, can I participate in these other clients as Leo Laporton planetary?
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   Okay.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.720]   So you're, like, you're already talking to people using all these other clients.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.720]   Oh.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:48.880]   And so like when you, when you posted stuff, I saw people from half a dozen different clients
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.880]   reply to you.
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.040]   Oh, interesting.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.800]   And so, but the, the thing with the sinking, and this is, this is part of what we're working
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:04.120]   on is sometimes you have to open the app and give it a minute for the sink.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.880]   And we need to figure out how to explain to people that it needs some time to sink.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   It's not in the box.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   No, it's pull.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880]   Okay.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.680]   Why pull not push?
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.680]   That's an hour conversation.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:18.680]   I'm sure.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:30.960]   Partially, we did pull not push because it solves some of the, the spam problems.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:39.480]   So if, you know, if you're at replying someone and bothering them a ton and you pull in,
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.160]   like, then they can push to you, then they can start spamming you and you have to deal
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.840]   with that spam.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:51.020]   But if you pull, so the way it works is you pull in the feeds of people you're following
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.200]   and then by default, one degree out further beyond that.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:02.440]   So I can see extended conversations of what's going on and then if something is further
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.040]   out, I start pulling in the feeds off in that direction.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.360]   So it's like a, I say it's like, you know, if you're like getting a big forest and you
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.600]   have a bright light, you only see the trees that are illuminated by the light at night.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.400]   And you can get a brighter light and pull in a larger section of the forest and see larger
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.560]   conversations.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:24.480]   But if someone is having some, you know, terrible rager with music you hate on the other
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.160]   end of the forest, you don't hear it.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.600]   How'd you know?
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.200]   That's what I didn't want to hear.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.200]   You have a whole, that's right.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.000]   You have a teenage son.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   Yes.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   The other thing that has to be here is that is that, hold on, scale had to be important.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   Okay.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   I want to take a break.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   I just have to take this break.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.160]   I also should point out that it looks like much like the barbarians at the gay Elon has
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.600]   taken possession of Twitter.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.320]   And that seems to have happened before we thought the deadline was Friday.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:05.040]   So we have a perfect panel to address what is happening now at Twitter.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.760]   Elon says, meaning a lot of people.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.000]   I don't think he owns it yet.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.440]   Well, he brought his own sink for reasons that nobody understands.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.440]   Therefore to flush it down the drain.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.440]   Maybe.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.600]   And a beautiful thing about Twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.800]   People are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.800]   Okay.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.440]   So anyway, we could talk about that and a few other things.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.840]   I am thrilled to have Ravel here who has deep roots in all of this and is doing something
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.480]   about it, which is not something you could say about everybody.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.920]   I'm really thrilled to have you here.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.520]   And of course, Jeff Jarvis, just a quick break.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.400]   We'll come back with more.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.680]   This week in Google brought to you today by Melissa.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:50.000]   Melissa is a leading provider of global data quality and address management solutions.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.520]   Now, if you're business, you have an address list, a client list, a customer list, you
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:12:00.400]   send your bills, you send brochures, you send catalogs, you have suppliers you work
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.920]   with, all of that is your data.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.240]   But if that data quality goes downhill, it can cost you a lot of money on average $15
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:17.560]   million a year in wasted ad spend and wasted billing, losing track of customers costs you
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.560]   money.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.000]   Don't waste your marketing dollars.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.520]   Be sure to manage your budgets effectively and smart because by the way, I got to tell
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:31.160]   you the longer poor quality data stays in your system, the losses continue to accumulate
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.320]   exponentially bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.200]   To ensure your business is successful, your customer information, these address lists
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.880]   need to be accurate.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.520]   High quality data doesn't cost you money.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.680]   It saves you money.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.040]   By the way, there's another side of this customer service.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.520]   If you've got a customer service line, somebody calls up, they says, "I didn't get my package,"
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.000]   and you say, "You live in Miami," right?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.760]   And they say, "No, I live in Portobello."
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.720]   You're going to say, "Whoops," and they're going to say, "I'm so angry.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.720]   This is awkward."
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.200]   Melissa recently partnered with ID Pal.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.280]   They've got something new.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.280]   They call Melissa ID.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.960]   This is also something you got to do accurately for a variety of reasons, seamless contact
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.000]   verification in real time.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.880]   Melissa ID, and it's a unique, fully customizable, out-of-the-box SaaS solution using a multi-layered
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.740]   approach by a metrics facial matching, liveness testing, address verification, document
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.240]   checks for automated identity verification.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.400]   There are a lot of reasons you might have to do this for compliance.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:38.400]   Any money laundering, politically exposed persons, the Bank Secrecy Act, this is a huge
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.720]   part of business these days, right?
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.720]   Melissa has been doing this for 37 plus years.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.240]   There's a standardization, correction, verification.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:53.520]   Their new app offers coverage of over 6,000 identification documents across 200 countries
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.240]   and jurisdictions.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:00.240]   It's great for any business charged with reducing costs associated with customer acquisition,
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.040]   operations, fulfillment.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.360]   It's huge for fraud, right?
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.160]   And you may even need to do it for compliance.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.920]   So you're reducing risk, you're ensuring compliance, you're keeping customers happy, and you're
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.160]   saving money.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.080]   Why wouldn't you want to do this?
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:20.520]   Protect your data from decay with 2.1 billion clean, validated records.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:24.120]   You could score and target customers with detailed demographic and firmographic data
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.120]   appends.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:31.320]   You can complete customer records adding missing names or addresses, phone numbers, email addresses.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.480]   And by the way, your data is always secure with Melissa.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:41.840]   They undergo independent security audits on a regular basis, SOC 2 HIPAA GDPR compliant.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.040]   They can do so much.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.040]   They can de-dupe, by the way.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.240]   For instance, duplicate information on your bottom line is the worst, right?
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.200]   I used to get five catalogs from Restoration Hardware.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:56.360]   All beautiful, thick, full-color catalogs, the same name and address.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.440]   They needed a little de-dupe, de-dupe-cation.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.840]   Melissa's data quality suite will eliminate clutter and duplicates, increasing the accuracy
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.040]   of your database, reducing your postage and mailing costs.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.760]   So you could do batch address, cleaning, you could do identity verification.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.000]   You've got geo-coding arrangements that will convert addresses into Latin long.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.440]   They've got email verification.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.760]   You can remove 95% of bad email addresses from your databases.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.760]   So know@thankyou.com.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.480]   You can just get rid of that.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480]   Lookups.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.440]   The Lookups app is available on iOS and Android to search addresses, verify social security
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.360]   numbers, access detailed property data, and more.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.280]   And that's all at your fingertips.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:37.960]   Make sure your customer contact data is up to date.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.840]   My Melissa's APIs in the developer portal, easy to log on, sign up, play in that API
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.280]   sandbox 24/7.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.400]   And when you get started with Melissa, right now you're going to get 1,000 records cleaned
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.400]   for free.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.880]   This is a good way to see what Melissa can do for you.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:55.840]   Get your worst, oldest, crutty-est database and send it over.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:00.560]   They even have a secure FTP so you can upload it and get it downloaded, cleaned 1,000 records
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.600]   clean for free, Melissa.com/twit.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:14.000]   Thank you, Melissa, for supporting this week in Google.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.320]   There's one thing I'm a little mad about.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.600]   Elon is calling himself the chief twit now, which is not true.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.600]   Not true.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.600]   There is only one.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.600]   There can be one.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:26.240]   Anyway, I saw him.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.240]   I saw him.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.720]   Yeah, we already been through this with Twitter.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.280]   That's the thing that's kind of irksome.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:38.920]   I'm sure somebody with any memory of history or something is going to come down the hall
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.560]   and says, "Eelon."
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.520]   Lisa suggested he take the W out.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.760]   That's fine with me.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.360]   There's lots of ways you could fix it.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.360]   Change the I to an A, but you can't be chief Twit, Elon.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.160]   We've already been over this.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.160]   Can I?
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.160]   Let me just say it that way.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.200]   We've already been over this, Elon.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:02.240]   Unless you'd like to buy us and then you own the name, I own the trademark.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.000]   You want the name, you can have it.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.880]   I don't know.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.800]   Can you trademark a handle?
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:15.520]   I'm sure he's already got the business cards printed.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:19.800]   What do you think of Elon owning a Twitter rabble?
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.800]   You must still have friends who work there, right?
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.800]   Sure.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.400]   Of course, I have friends that work there.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.200]   I use Twitter all the time and I care about it a lot.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.480]   What do I think about it?
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.600]   You have the same reaction we all do.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.680]   I don't know what to say.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.160]   I'm mixed feeling.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:44.920]   So one, I think he has lots of terrible ideas.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:54.880]   I think he, having worked with people who worked directly with him, can be quite toxic
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:02.320]   and difficult and that sucks.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:11.440]   On the other hand, the past companies that he's bought like Tesla and SpaceX and Solar
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:18.440]   City and really PayPal too because he was just the money guy for PayPal, have become
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:24.280]   successful companies and have done lots of good in the world.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:34.080]   We have a Starlink internet connection at my cabin in California and it's amazing.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:39.840]   Before Elon bought Twitter, which now seems like it's a thing, Twitter was dependent on
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:50.680]   the market and was always at risk of the management team being removed if they didn't
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.920]   do what a set of investors said.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.360]   Jack said this and some of the text messages he had to do.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.880]   He only had a few percentage of the company.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.120]   There's no super voting shares in Twitter.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.600]   Twitter was restricted.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:09.200]   I had a conversation with Jack right after Trump got elected and he said, "What should
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.880]   I do about Trump's account?"
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:14.640]   These other alt-right folks like Richard Spencer should I delete the accounts?
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.880]   He had lots of conversations with people about this.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:26.320]   My answer was if Jack as CEO with almost no shares in the company goes and deletes Trump's
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:33.680]   account, then he's going to get removed as CEO.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.240]   We all said, "Jack, why the hell don't you just do this thing?
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.600]   He's clearly violating the rules."
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.800]   The market held sway over it.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:51.600]   Elon buying Twitter means that Twitter is no longer dependent on the whims of the market
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:57.920]   and groups like Silver Lake who are going to come in and do much worse.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:02.240]   His ideas about how moderation should happen are crazy.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.160]   We have no idea if they'll implement his ideas.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:10.840]   His ideas about some of the open network stuff are good and interesting.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:18.320]   Ironically enough for something like the Blue Sky project, in theory, I don't know if he's
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:23.800]   even fully aware of it, should be a big advocate for it.
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:28.000]   I think that ideologically a lot of Twitter employees aren't going to like working for
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   him.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.840]   They aren't going to like the political decisions he's going to make.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:39.560]   Twitter employees believe deeply in Jack and where he was coming from and were very loyal
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.960]   to it, him.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.960]   There's not going to be that loyalty.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.040]   Twitter is going to lose a lot of employees.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.000]   We'll see.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.720]   I don't know that it is necessarily the worst thing that could happen.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:04.520]   I think Silver Lake coming in and splitting it up and selling off the parts or gutting
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.640]   the management team would have been worse.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.640]   I don't like his investors.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:14.160]   The most optimistic thing has been worse.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:19.160]   The other options were rough.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:24.960]   You think one of them was inevitable just because of Twitter's faltering financial
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.960]   auctions.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.200]   That's a good way to put it.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.040]   Twitter's never been a good business.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:37.080]   Twitter's always been much more important to its users and to society and the news and
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:43.800]   culture than it has been in terms of making money.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:47.480]   I'm a technologist so I don't know exactly why.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:55.480]   Instagram makes tons of money because the ads don't need to be witty tweets.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:01.680]   Twitter makes you like you have to be good at Twitter to run ads.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.840]   You're good at Twitter.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.400]   Why are you running an ad?
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.160]   You don't have to be good at Instagram to run a good ad.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.160]   That's a really good point.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   I never really thought of that.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:21.600]   I think this all underscores the fact that Twitter should really be a public institution,
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.960]   not a private business.
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:28.160]   It's not a good business but it's a great town square.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:34.240]   Obviously, no one person should own the town square, even Elon.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:40.600]   Maybe this solution is really something like Skittlebud and Planetary and something decentralized,
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.600]   something no one owns.
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.400]   Was that a discussion way back then?
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:51.320]   Was enough known in our innocent early days to say, maybe there shouldn't be a company.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:57.600]   Maybe there should be something else or maybe the API is a moral choice.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:04.080]   Was it just too early and too naive and too innocent back then?
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:09.080]   There was a debate back then because I remember Jack saying that Twitter should be a public
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.920]   utility.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:16.440]   In the early days of Twitter, he went around and told anyone who had asked, "Twitter should
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.080]   be a public utility."
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   Other people are like, "Jack, stop saying that.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:26.680]   We won't get an investment."
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.920]   The rumors are that because Twitter had acquisition talks with Facebook and Yahoo and Google and
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.120]   Microsoft everyone.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:40.240]   The rumors are that Jack's enthusiasm for Twitter as a public utility is scared away
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.200]   all these people who are acquiring it.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:50.040]   Now, Adam says he wasn't going to ever sell Twitter anyway but Jack always thought it
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:56.600]   was a public utility and always treated it that way but we had no model for funding it
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.600]   that way.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:05.640]   There's a Twitter account called @ByTwitter which is a collection of people who are trying
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.960]   to make users collect the money to buy Twitter.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.960]   Good luck.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:13.320]   God promises is of a few million dollars.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.160]   Not close to it.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.160]   I try to collect.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:23.480]   There's a whole concept called platform co-ops which says that these giant platform businesses,
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:32.680]   whether or not it's Airbnb or Twitter, should be owned in part by the participants of it.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.720]   The By Twitter project is cool.
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:35.720]   It's not...
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:43.480]   They never worked but it's a neat idea and the platform co-ops are a neat idea.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:48.440]   The problem is where do you get the capital to build these things and where do you get
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.000]   the capital to take the risks?
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.320]   We talked about Jaikou and Poundse and Gawala and all these other...
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.880]   Technorati, all these other companies that had just as much promise as ODO and Twitter
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.120]   in the early days and they're all gone.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:11.760]   Venture capital is set up to take that risk and you take the...
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:20.680]   That's the plus and minus of it.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:27.040]   The real tragedy is that we didn't know about the super voting shares that got set up with
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.040]   Facebook.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:36.800]   If Evan known about the super voting shares and realized how important it was and been
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:42.600]   able to raise money that way and demand it and be able to get through, then this whole
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.080]   conversation would be different.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.080]   Interesting.
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.040]   That's what Zuck did and that's how he's kept control of Facebook.
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.280]   You think, "If Williams would have been the right guy to keep control of Twitter, that
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.120]   he would have done a good job at being able to ignore market forces and have those super
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.120]   voting shares?"
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.120]   I don't know.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.160]   That's really hard to work for.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.760]   The board at Twitter is notoriously awful.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:09.720]   That's what everybody says.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.200]   The board has got all these people who don't even use Twitter.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:14.200]   They don't even use Twitter.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.200]   Right.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.200]   Right.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.200]   Or not publicly, maybe they use Twitter in secret accounts.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.360]   I have half a dozen Twitter accounts that I use for different purposes.
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.360]   The board should be people...
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.040]   Nor do they have much Twitter stock.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.080]   They don't have much of a dog in the hide.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.240]   The fact Jack has the largest...
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.880]   Had the largest share of Twitter stock and it was only like 2%.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:38.040]   But there was a time when the board was better.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:41.720]   Like Fred Wilson was a fantastic board member.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.720]   Yes.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.720]   Yes.
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:47.560]   And really got it.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:55.600]   I don't know the inside baseball of when he chose to walk away, but Fred signed off on
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.080]   Twitter being federated.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.680]   He said, "Make that experiment.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.760]   See what happens."
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.760]   That's very funny.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.760]   Yep.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.520]   Well, we'll find out.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:13.560]   The fact that Elon's wandering around Twitter untethered indicates not that he's succeeded
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.000]   in closing the deal, but that they're very close.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.560]   He has till Friday before the chance for a court in Delaware picks up the trial once
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.560]   again.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.560]   That's the deadline.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:30.200]   So I suspect maybe this time he will own it, which is a...
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.840]   May you live in interesting times.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.840]   We definitely...
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:33.840]   Yes.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.280]   We definitely do.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.040]   And I'm always impressed.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:45.080]   We talk all the time with Kevin Marks about the open web and indie web and Corey Doctorow,
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:51.120]   who years ago told me, "The solution to all this is for the geeks to stand up, write
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.960]   their own stuff, do their own thing.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.760]   We know how it should be.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.760]   Don't let these big money guys run everything."
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:03.000]   And you haven't taken any investment in planetary?
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.160]   So I've taken a bit of investment.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:14.240]   I did a $1.4 million pre-seed round led by Bloomberg Beta, who are, as a VC, very supportive
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.800]   of open source projects.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.360]   They've been fantastic.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:26.280]   And also got in support from a number of other very early stage VCs.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.280]   I don't know if they're investing because they think that planetary will be successful
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:36.320]   and make money, or they just want to throw rocks at Facebook's class house, or...
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.320]   They're playing 3D chess with you.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.240]   I'm surprised that you're taking money.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.640]   I guess you have to.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.360]   But don't you worry about the same thing happening to you that happened to Twitter?
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.840]   Sure, except I have super voting shares.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.840]   Oh!
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.640]   Listen learned.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.400]   I get it.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.720]   A bunch of time has passed.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:02.200]   Now super voting shares among founders for these type of companies is commonplace.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.200]   Is commonplace.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.880]   And they understand why it's important.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:05.880]   Right.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:06.880]   Good.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:07.880]   Well, I'm glad to hear that.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.000]   Dave Weiner just tweeted six minutes ago, "Dear Elon Musk, Twitter should support outbound
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.400]   and inbound RSS.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.040]   No need to wait for an open protocol.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.080]   It's already there."
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.440]   God bless him.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:19.760]   Is RSS enough?
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.720]   Is that enough of an API?
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:27.880]   God knows we've kept podcasting alive on RSS for some time.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.360]   It's not enough, but it's good.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.360]   It's a start.
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.960]   It's a start.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:38.960]   Even with podcasting, RSS is under assault by Spotify and Amazon.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.360]   And I guess I heart.
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:47.360]   A lot of companies just would prefer you to use their app and not use an RSS reader to
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.160]   get your podcasts.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:52.560]   Never dead set against that because what that does is it gives them all this information
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.920]   about you.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:59.240]   I can't collect information about you if you listen on an RSS feeder, which most podcast
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.240]   apps are.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240]   Dave's great line.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.240]   You know what?
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.240]   I saw him.
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.240]   Go ahead, Rebel.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:08.200]   Well, as you're going to say, I was having a conversation with Chris Messina who did the
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.560]   hashtag and it was around all these things.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:15.120]   And we were talking about what went wrong with Web 2.0.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:22.440]   And we realized that podcasting is the one major part of the Web 2.0 movement or world
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:29.480]   or innovation that didn't get enclosed into a centralized platform.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:33.080]   And partially it was the benign neglect of Apple.
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:38.560]   Basically, they built just enough to lock everyone else out and then ignored it that
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.640]   let this ecosystem thrive.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.640]   Yes.
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:44.600]   When Apple announced podcasting and I didn't realize it was going to kill audio, but when
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:48.040]   they announced they were going to do podcasting, I said it's simultaneously the best thing
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:51.160]   that could happen to podcasting and the worst thing.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.160]   The good news is you're right.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.720]   They had other fish to fry.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.840]   They didn't need to take it over.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.840]   Thank God.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:02.000]   But that's why it's so interesting because RSS is so simple.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.760]   But just a simple thing like that can keep something going without being beholden to the
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.800]   behemoths.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:11.800]   That's great.
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.920]   Thank you, Apple, for neglecting us.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.960]   In a sense, the same thing happened with blogs, I would say, is that as we discussed earlier,
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:24.280]   Google buying blogger and then speak of the line in the collect, it just sits there with
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:29.080]   cobwebs and blogs kept RSS and blog state independent.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:36.480]   And WordPress came in, I think, as a positive influence in the field and showed what could
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.480]   happen.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:42.080]   We had Matt Mullenweg on a few weeks ago and of course he bought Tumblr.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:48.040]   After all the blows Tumblr has taken to the head, I hope that he can resurrect it.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:51.520]   I'm thrilled to see that he's made pocket casts open source.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.840]   He's definitely dedicated to open source.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:54.840]   So...
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:00.440]   No, he's been a tremendous force for good in this whole thing where he managed to build
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:06.440]   up a large company that has a substantial force in the internet today and not have it
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:09.440]   be closed and locked down.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:16.800]   We don't express enough thanks for what Mullenweg has done and automatic.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.960]   I thanked him, but you're right.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   Yes, we did.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.960]   We were.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.400]   I think the world of Matt.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.400]   There are...
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.320]   You know, a lot of them are old timers.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.880]   People who have really made a huge difference.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:29.880]   Dave Weiner is a great example.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.880]   He really made a huge difference in the space.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:37.840]   And now I'm pleased to meet you, Ravel, because I think you're one of those guys who is still
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:45.160]   working on making the internet work for humans.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.360]   And we need to make that fight because it is such a powerful tool and it's so good,
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.240]   there's so much you can do with it.
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:51.560]   We just need to fight for it.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.360]   We can't let them just co-opt it all.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:57.720]   I'm so grateful for the work you do and for coming in and sharing it with us.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.720]   It's just a delightful conversation.
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:02.400]   Oh, this is tons of fun.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.760]   Great to have you.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.680]   Good luck with your teenager.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:12.280]   We do stream, by the way, you can tell them on Twitch and YouTube.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:18.840]   No, he texted me asking for the URL live stream and I'm like, aren't you supposed to
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.360]   be in class right now?
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:22.440]   He's like, "Oh, yeah."
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.440]   I think you should get a pass if your dad's on the Twitch.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440]   You should get a pass.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.640]   Because he's a developer too.
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:33.800]   Yeah, he's learning C# right now to do Unity.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:36.160]   So because he's into doing video games and stuff.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.160]   Very cool.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.320]   I'm not a C# developer, but I offered a pair program with him.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.320]   Fun.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.320]   So we've both game together.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.320]   Fun.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.320]   Are you going to do that?
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.320]   Are you doing that?
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320]   Yeah, yeah, we're doing that.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.920]   In VS Code or what are you using?
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.760]   Yeah, we use VS Code.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:52.760]   How fun.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.840]   Let's throw the ball around the backyard.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:55.840]   That's the modern.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.360]   That's the 21st century version of playing catch.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.160]   So how does it work?
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:04.600]   Do you'll write some code and then he'll write some code?
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.040]   I mean, I do pair programming all the time.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.880]   Oh, interesting.
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:15.240]   And where you get a single keyboard, single monitor both people sitting there.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:20.440]   One person, you can either have two keyboards or one, but with a one is just one person
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:25.640]   is driving and the other is kind of doing commentary navigating of doing stuff.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   Sometimes they have a laptop on the side so they can look stuff up.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.760]   Fun.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.960]   It's great for debugging and figuring out new stuff.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:37.120]   Sort of the mid level of like, I know what I'm doing.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.520]   And I just need to implement it.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.640]   One on one, single programming is better.
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.000]   But if it's like, oh, I have no idea how this works or I have no idea what it should
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.280]   do, that's when I really enjoy pair programming.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.920]   How fun.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.840]   I think we can wrap it up with Rabel.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.400]   I don't want to keep you too long.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.320]   It's been a great pleasure.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.280]   Thank you for doing what you're doing.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.840]   What is your recommendation for people who've listened and get it and say, yeah, I'm not
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.840]   going to leave Twitter.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.080]   I'm not going to leave Facebook.
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:12.520]   But I want to support the idea of having something that's more personally controlled.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:17.080]   Should they just download planetary and play with it or where would you start?
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.840]   So they can download planetary or one of the other Scuttlebutt apps, Miniverse Works on
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:22.840]   Android.
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.840]   There's desktop apps.
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:28.120]   They're all linked to from our site.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:33.720]   So if Jeff goes on Miniverse because he's using Android, he won't be a second class citizen
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720]   on planetary.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:39.840]   No, no, because you have no idea which apps people are using.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:45.880]   I can tell because the like buttons or the likes are slightly different and there's some
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.320]   subtle differences.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:54.120]   But you won't be able to sell like Tel and you guys can either join a room or set up
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:02.560]   a room, you can share your room account if he holds it on a device that has Miniverse.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.480]   It'll connect directly to you.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:07.320]   We have tons of different apps.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:11.080]   Some look a little more like chat, some look a little more like Instagram.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.960]   So you can pick one that kind of fits your ethos, but it's the same content all across
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:16.960]   the board.
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:17.960]   Yep.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:18.960]   Nice.
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:21.240]   Well, there's the ability to run on subnet.
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:31.120]   So we have this app called Ajo, A-H-A-U.io and it's only for Maori.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.520]   So it's here in New Zealand and they run on a separate network and it's an autonomous
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:51.040]   and the social circles in Ajo work differently because they use Maori family village tribe
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:52.040]   structures.
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:59.080]   And so you get these concentric circles of encrypted communities and then the servers
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:05.600]   that do the relaying, like do store and ford, we call them pubs, exist in each Maori Mirai.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:09.400]   So there's 770 of them across New Zealand.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:15.160]   And as your phone or laptop goes into the Mirai, these community centers, it sinks directly
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.600]   between everyone else.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:22.480]   And so it's really super amazing.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:29.920]   And we mix who's there in that photo is one of the developers and Cherise.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:35.320]   So they do development on Ajo here in New Zealand and they also work on planetary.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:47.600]   And it's just a social network and an identity system that is based on their own traditional
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.520]   ways of doing things.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:58.200]   And their next step is actually to use their Maori ways of creating identity.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.920]   So you verify who you know and who your family member is.
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:07.840]   And the Maori owned banks and credit unions will use that as your identity verification
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:11.200]   to open accounts instead of the New Zealand government.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.000]   I am getting chills.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.360]   This is this is this is what should be happening.
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:19.120]   This is a perfect proof of concept.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:24.680]   If a community with its own unique ways can have its sovereignty and still work and in
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:28.240]   a row and it's and still in a robbery, then you've solved something.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:32.560]   You've really made something that people can use.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.560]   Unbelievable.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:34.880]   That's fantastic.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.280]   And the banks are using it.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.280]   I love that.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.880]   Because because there are Maori, Ewe, Ewe's the tribal structure because there are Maori
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:48.480]   owned banks, all they have to do to comply with the banking regulation is have a verifiable
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.320]   system of verify identity.
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.160]   And they go to the New Zealand government and say, look, you know, we have sovereignty
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.320]   over this community.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:59.400]   We have sovereignty over this space.
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:02.920]   This is the way we're verifying who's who.
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:09.320]   And we're going to open bank accounts and get the unbanked bank, but not because of
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:14.320]   some, you know, post colonial government, but because of the way that the Maori have
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:17.480]   been doing identity for 800 years.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:24.360]   And like next week, I'm going to have a call with Mapuche in southern Argentina and Chile
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:32.360]   about them wanting to use the same system so that they can have an offline first way
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.640]   of doing social, but it's closed social.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:40.880]   It's based on their own traditional ways of who do you identify and how do you connect
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:41.920]   and what you want to do.
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:46.880]   And so, and the Maori in New Zealand, they're very well connected.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.000]   New Zealand has a good internet connection over the else.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.320]   But in Chile and Argentina, especially southern Chile, where the Mapuche are, they're going
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.560]   to connections are terrible.
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.720]   So that offlineness works.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:05.480]   And we also have a deployment among Brazilians in the Amazon with all these villagers and
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:10.960]   stuff where again, mostly offline communities who needed their own separate network that
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:13.600]   worked differently.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.680]   And that runs on the same protocol that planetary uses, but planetary uses it in a much more
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:22.080]   open Twitter, Tumblr, like way.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.480]   I'm just blown away.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:26.880]   This is really heartening.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.800]   This is using technology for people.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.680]   And it's just fantastic, just fantastic.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.280]   Somebody in the chatroom said, "You buried the lead."
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:39.800]   But we had to go through all that to get here.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:44.040]   And I think that's really in a way the whole story is we had to go through all of this
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.360]   to get to this point.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:51.080]   It's just very, very exciting the way that this can be used.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:57.520]   In a way, this solves the decentralized problem without, it's not blockchain, it's not crypto.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:01.040]   But it's similar in that sense that you have keys, you have privacy.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.840]   And it is decentralized, right?
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:05.440]   There's no central store of infrastructure.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:10.640]   There's no central store or registry or things like that.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.120]   You can either directly peer things.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.440]   It's local first.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:19.960]   You can run these room servers and pub servers like the Ahu runs and they're the Maori
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:23.200]   eyes that store in forward messages.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.920]   But they're not necessary for the network.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:34.480]   And so for example, kind of like that, except you don't have it all flat.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:39.440]   Apple requires us for App Store rules to be able to block and ban content.
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:45.560]   And so our app comes back, like the only centralized thing we have is Apple and their
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:51.000]   App Store rules say that users can report content and we can ban it and we ban content.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.520]   There was a bunch of pro-ISIS content that we banned.
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:03.560]   There was a user who came on and started forcing gay furry porn replies to everyone.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.920]   And we banned that.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:15.400]   There were Norwegian neo-Nazis who wanted to make, they wanted to use it and they wanted
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:23.920]   to only scan the navy and languages were the only true master.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:30.840]   So we banned that from the planetary relay servers and the planetary app.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:42.960]   But if someone wanted to set up their own nodes and their own part of the network that's
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.360]   far off on the other end of the forest, we don't know it's there.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:53.680]   And it's kind of like you can put whatever you want on your own domain name.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:57.480]   But we don't have to link to each other.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:59.880]   Yeah, Massedon kind of does that too.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:02.800]   I don't have to federate with GAB.
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.800]   Exactly.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:06.800]   But GAB does it.
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.720]   And things can be removed from the Google search engine too.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:09.720]   Like you can make it so it's...
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.720]   Oh, interesting.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:14.640]   But it's not an incomprehensible behavior doesn't need to be easily discovered.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.640]   Interesting.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:21.400]   But because there's no... there's not even a centralized DHT, like there's no distributed
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.400]   hash table.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.060]   Like there's no... there's no unifying element to this at all.
[01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:27.060]   Interesting.
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:29.920]   And so we don't know how many people are using the network.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.920]   Wow.
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:35.200]   We have got to turn you into customer service but I now have many of us installed.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:36.800]   I put a post up.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.800]   Yes.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.800]   How do I connect with Leo?
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.560]   I need to get an invitation from somewhere.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.560]   Right?
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:42.960]   So, yeah.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:51.320]   So what Leo needs to do is go into his settings and he can either get his I name or register
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:55.640]   with the room server so he can register Leo or Leo Laport.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:56.840]   Can I show him a QR code?
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.840]   I'm there.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:59.560]   Is there in the planetary app is there a way?
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:00.560]   No.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:01.560]   Because my name is...
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:02.560]   Was not here.
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:03.560]   No.
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.560]   Capital Z plus plus zero TL which is, you know, obviously it's...
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:08.560]   This reminds me of my days on CompuServe 117341.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:12.160]   Well, but the whole point is we don't have to know that, right?
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.160]   Right.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:20.120]   So what you need to do Leo is you go into your settings which is on the sidebar and
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:24.360]   it says like connect to a room.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:25.680]   There'll be a list that says room.
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:29.880]   And in there it'll say register an alias.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.640]   And if you put your name in there.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:32.640]   Okay.
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:39.320]   Then anyone and what, you know, if you put Leo Laport then anyone could go to Leo Laport.planetary.name
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:41.320]   for example.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:48.440]   Oh, so it does give me a canonical name on the planetary server.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:49.440]   All right.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.440]   So let me...
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.440]   But you could...
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:55.080]   You could like there could be many of those servers.
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.880]   So I could have many names.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:57.880]   You know, which is beautiful.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:58.880]   Yeah.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:44:59.880]   You could have many names.
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.880]   This is fantastic.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.880]   I'll get the, I'll get the remedial for Leo later.
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.880]   Well...
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:16.040]   And once that's registered, Jeff, you just go to in your browser, you know, Leo Laport.planetary.name
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:20.000]   and it'll say, oh, you have mini verse installed.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.040]   Do you want to open up Leo's profile in mini verse and it'll open it up and you start following
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.040]   him.
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:28.920]   And they'll directly connect to each other.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:32.760]   So I'm looking under settings at web services, aliases, betas.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.760]   That where I should go.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:36.760]   I can definitely beta like...
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:38.760]   Register new alias.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:39.760]   That's okay.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:41.760]   Because I can't...
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:44.240]   I don't know if that's my phone or you, but I can't type into that field.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.240]   So I'll...
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.240]   Oh.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.240]   I'll get back to you.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.240]   We will figure out.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.920]   My next show will be connected.
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.920]   But yeah.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.560]   So, but that's a perfect example.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.560]   And but the beauty of that is you can have as many names as you want.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.560]   And exactly.
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.080]   And different personas in different rooms.
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:03.800]   You can be whoever you want in every room.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:05.480]   I love this.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.480]   I love this.
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:12.440]   And the rooms act as like their persona, but they also act as a way of grouping people
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:17.840]   together so that you can see, you know, if a room is all of a particular thing.
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.320]   So like we have one in beta called queer.family.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.600]   And it's all people who are LGBTQ.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:28.840]   And so you, if you want to join that community, join that community, you register a name that's
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:35.440]   there and then you can see the posts within that community and discover people that way.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:38.680]   And anyone can set up their own room servers.
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:39.680]   So it shows...
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.440]   And if that doesn't comes in...
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.920]   Who has the right to be able to kick them out?
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.880]   At the moment the person who set up the room has the creator of the room.
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:55.760]   But we're working with the Medigov project so that the room could set rules for who are
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.000]   the admins and what are the decisions.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.640]   So everybody's a member of the room gets a vote on kicking someone out or a vote on who
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.840]   the moderators are for this month.
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:06.840]   And I think that the...
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:11.800]   I don't know if you're familiar with the Medigov project out of Harvard's Berkman Center,
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:16.560]   but they're doing lots of interesting work and saying we need to move beyond a feudal
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:22.440]   model of governing online communities and look at all these ways and say, "Okay, this
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.440]   is this group.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:24.440]   They're running a room.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:28.480]   People in the room shouldn't just be able to say whoever created the room is the admin
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:33.120]   of the room, but you should be able to either put forward a vote and have everyone in the
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:39.800]   room vote or decide who the moderators are at the moment or be able to recall a moderator
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:42.800]   who's behaving poorly."
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:48.120]   And so that's super interesting to me of saying, "Okay, how do we instead of saying
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:52.440]   this is one model for governance, how do we open up the space to say there are many
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:53.960]   models for governance?"
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:48:00.080]   And I'm super excited about the Medigov project and what they're doing with that.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:02.560]   I highly recommend folks check it out.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:03.560]   So excited.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.560]   God bless you.
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.560]   Yeah, isn't that great?
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.560]   It's great.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.560]   It's just very encouraging.
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.280]   Because a lot of times this show we get very depressed because fear is just swamped by
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.840]   all of this big tech being misused and so forth.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.960]   And Jeff, to your credit, always says, "Oh no, but this is the Internet is--"
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:22.960]   Early days.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:23.960]   "It's early days.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.840]   The Internet has huge potential.
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:26.840]   Look at all the things."
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.280]   And you know, a lot of it, by the way, Ravel is around social organizing.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.960]   I'm thinking your handle, Ravel has a little bit to do with being a Ravel rouser.
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.960]   Oh, I am definitely.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:37.200]   Yeah, I hope you keep doing that too.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.200]   You keep doing that too.
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.200]   Keep rousing now.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:43.160]   Because I've always thought it's good to be a subversive and sheep's clothing and that's
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:44.160]   what I am.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:46.400]   So, Bravo, well done.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.440]   Ravel, a real pleasure to meet you.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:56.240]   Everybody should-- I think start at either at the planetary site, which is planetary.social.
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:01.200]   Or if you're interested in Scuttlebutt, knowing about Scuttlebutt, you can go to scuttlebutt.nz.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:06.440]   Both roads lead to the same endpoint, which is getting on the network, the Scuttlebutt
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.680]   network, so we can talk.
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.640]   And at some point, I think we'll set up a twit room as a experiment.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:16.640]   Maybe actually a twig room, just for twig.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.080]   I think I'm going to be able to show shit at one's own room.
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:20.080]   How about that?
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.080]   Why not?
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.080]   We can connect.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.080]   You can have as many rooms as you want, right?
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.080]   Yep.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:26.840]   I'd love to work with the guys to set that up.
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:27.840]   Oh, good.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.680]   And by the way, I now know, because I'm following Ravel on planetary, that you went out and
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:35.120]   you got a fancy Sony camera.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.360]   You got a bookshelfy, there's a whole bunch of stuff for the show.
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:39.280]   Oh, thank you.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:46.360]   I saw you guys talk about planetary a couple of weeks ago, and I was blown away at the
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.360]   stage and the screens and everything else.
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:50.840]   And I'm like, I want that.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:53.280]   And so I went and started ordering the things.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:50:00.200]   And then we started talking and you're like, well, maybe you should come on the show.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:08.680]   So I'm impressed with all the production quality of twit and this week in Google and
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.840]   tried to upgrade my environment to match.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.160]   Well, you get two thumbs up.
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.160]   You did a great job.
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:16.160]   You look good.
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:17.160]   The depth of feel is excellent.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.600]   That's a good, you got a good camera.
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.440]   You got the Sony vlogging camera.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:21.440]   Escape room.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:22.440]   Escape room.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:26.480]   Five out of ten or they go to ten or five?
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:27.480]   Ten out of ten.
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.480]   Okay.
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.440]   We give you ten out of ten on my room raider.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.480]   Well, thank you so much.
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:33.480]   Thank you, Ravel.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.480]   Really a pleasure meeting you.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:35.480]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.360]   Jeff, we have a few other stories we can go through if you want.
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.360]   We could well, you know, I thank you for doing that, Leo.
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.200]   I am so inspired about 50 times.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.640]   I am inspired by this.
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.320]   But Maori example, it just blows me away.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.320]   Just blows me away.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:55.960]   It's from other communities and other cultures.
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:58.320]   Yeah, there's hope, there's possibility.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:01.000]   And the solution isn't the technology.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.720]   The solution is people doing good things.
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:06.200]   Well, okay, but you got to have people technologists like Ravel.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.520]   Oh, we don't have to do it.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:08.520]   Really accomplished.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.720]   I mean, this guy is extremely good.
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:13.440]   He knows what he's doing.
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:16.560]   He's solved problems you and I hadn't thought about.
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:17.960]   He's having them.
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:18.960]   Because he's lived them.
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:23.200]   Having that history, that background and the skills to implement is fantastic.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:24.640]   You have to make mistakes.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:29.840]   You have to go down wrong, wrong rat holes to learn what the rat holes are.
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:35.760]   And that's important to remember that these mistakes are just part of the growing process.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:37.880]   Speaking of rat holes, we got news today too.
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:40.800]   Well, I'll go through it quickly.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:45.320]   So Elon decided to call himself Chief Twit.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:53.480]   I'm very gratified by the other many people on Twitter who have responded saying, "Dude,
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:56.520]   there is one Chief Twit."
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:57.520]   So we'll figure that out.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:00.160]   I bet he's getting the business cards printed right now.
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:03.800]   We don't know exactly what's going on.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:07.040]   All we know is what we see on the Twitter.
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:11.600]   But it does seem as if he is fairly confident that that deal is going to close.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.160]   He still has to get regulatory approval, doesn't he?
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:16.760]   I don't know if there's any regulatory approval.
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:17.920]   In this case, it's not a merger.
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:18.920]   It's not a merger.
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:19.920]   He's just buying it.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:24.160]   Well, I guess it is officially a merger with X Corp or whatever, but it's not really a merger.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:26.160]   And I saw one story.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.160]   I don't think we talked about this last week.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.160]   I don't think we did.
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:33.200]   The banks are going to, rather than selling the debt, which they would normally do, the
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:36.360]   debt's so useless and so valueless, they're going to hold on their books.
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.640]   They'd have to do junk bonds.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:38.640]   It's so bad.
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:41.640]   They're going to hold on their books at a $44 billion valuation.
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.320]   Wow.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:46.280]   Which means they could lose as much as half a billion dollars.
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.440]   Morgan Stanley, the lead on that.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.440]   We'll see.
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:56.120]   I mean, is Elon, what kind of welcome does he get walking into Twitter after having announced?
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:57.520]   I'm going to fire 75 percent.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:00.560]   I've heard that on the summer executive said you should go up and say hello to Elon.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.640]   Does he already said, am I one of the 75 percent?
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:05.640]   I don't want to say hello to Elon.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:06.640]   Thank you very much.
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:11.320]   Actually, a number of people who work to Twitter or work at Twitter have said, you know what?
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:13.400]   I got to tell you, there's a lot of dead wood.
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.040]   It's not as it's not.
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.640]   It's maybe something needs to happen.
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:19.160]   Well, no, I mean, like a lot.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:21.680]   The engineering teams are massively bloated.
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:24.880]   A lot of people do absolutely nothing.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:28.960]   So we'll see.
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:30.120]   There's also a lot of good people there.
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:31.120]   I mean, let's see.
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:32.120]   Oh, of course.
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.120]   Think about all these tech companies people can stand.
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:41.160]   I know brilliant people at Facebook and at Google, and at Twitter and everywhere.
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:42.800]   What business should they be companies or not?
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:44.600]   Should they be working in different ways?
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.840]   Well, we'll watch with interest.
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:50.560]   Maybe we'll know more by the end of the week.
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:54.640]   An interesting speaking of Elon Musk and Starlink, an interesting use for Starlink without Elon
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:56.280]   Musk's help.
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:02.680]   Some researchers at UT Austin have figured out a way to use it as a GPS system.
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:07.040]   There are a lot of satellites up there, and it turns out that in order to do it at Internet
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:13.840]   access, they have to send a lot of positioning information, time information, a lot of metadata
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:18.240]   that turns out to be useful, not as good as GPS.
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:24.200]   You're only going to be able to use it to do a location within 30 meters.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:30.520]   But that's not bad, and it doesn't require any help from Elon.
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:32.960]   Just in the normal operation of the satellites.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:37.000]   Well, I think the reports were there some time ago, Leo, that Russia was going to screw
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.800]   with GPS and you wouldn't know where you are and all kinds of stuff.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:40.960]   Good to have a backup.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:41.960]   Independent GPS.
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.720]   Good to have a backup.
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:47.600]   Spotify, as you probably know, is trying to get into audio books.
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:51.560]   One more area they can own, but you know who really owns audio books?
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:55.080]   Amazon with Audible, which is about 90% of the market.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:58.240]   The other 10% is Apple.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:00.800]   Google have audio book stores.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:03.960]   Apple actually sells Audible books.
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:07.360]   And Spotify is getting a little hit up.
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:15.320]   This is Nick Zicherman, near Zicherman, who came to Spotify from anchor.fm and has been
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:18.360]   leading the audio book push.
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:24.920]   He says that Apple initially approved the new Spotify app with audio books.
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:30.440]   But then when they pushed an update, some months later Apple knocked it off.
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:35.680]   Then it's been three times now that because what Apple doesn't want is Spotify to say.
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:39.800]   And if you want to buy a book, go here.
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:42.400]   Apple wants that 30%.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.200]   And they're going to do everything they can.
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.480]   It's two companies I don't like at war with each other, which is a little shot in Friday
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:49.480]   game.
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:50.480]   Yeah, no way.
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:54.000]   I don't completely mind Spotify is trying to ruin podcasts.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.760]   Apple's putting ads up now.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:58.040]   What's what happens now with that?
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:00.640]   Their virtue about data is going to go way fast.
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.960]   Let me look at some of your story.
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:04.960]   Shutterstock.
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:08.480]   We talked about how Getty does not want to sell AI generated images.
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:14.360]   Well, Shutterstock, another stock photo company says, "Yeah, we're going to do AI generated
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:18.400]   stock imagery and we're going to do it through a dolly too with help from OpenAI."
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:19.400]   And fascinating.
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:24.880]   They say that they're going to reimburse the creators whose work is used to train the algorithm.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:26.520]   They're creating a control of how that works.
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:27.520]   I don't know.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:32.280]   Well, that is a good question because that's kind of a judgment call.
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:35.760]   I guess you can look at the prompt and see if you mentioned Ritkowski.
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:38.920]   Then I guess you have to send money to Ritkowski and the prompt.
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:44.880]   He's the one that really is complaining about this.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:47.440]   Good news.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:50.320]   Playing games actually is good for kids.
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:57.960]   Playing lots of video games may benefit kids' brains, a study of more than 2,000 children
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:04.240]   aged 9 and 10 conducted by the University of Vermont's Department of Psychiatry.
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:07.680]   They tested children who game at least 21 hours a week.
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:08.680]   That's a lot.
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:10.640]   Can't you go outside?
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:13.280]   That's three hours a day every day of the week.
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:16.280]   That's okay.
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.280]   So that's, I would say, hardcore gaming, right?
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.280]   Yes.
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:19.280]   Yes.
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:20.560]   And against kids who don't play at all.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:27.000]   The gamers did better than non-gamers in tests where they had to control impulse behavior.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000]   Impulse control.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000]   Do you learn that in gaming?
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.160]   I guess you do.
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.600]   I guess you want to win and you want to hold yourself back, I guess.
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.600]   Go back.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:34.600]   Sniping.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.920]   If you like to snipe, you got to wait.
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:40.040]   And better at memorizing information.
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:43.760]   During the test, researchers observed the gamers' brains, I guess they did functional
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:50.520]   MRIs while they're playing, showed more activity in regions associated with attention and memory.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:53.680]   See, those technologies are not so bad.
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:56.040]   I mean, you know, these studies, they come out all the time.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:57.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:00.760]   American Academy of Pediatrics recommends kids play no more than an hour or two games
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:01.760]   a day.
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:06.280]   When I was a kid, we didn't have video games, but my parents would only let me watch half
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.240]   an hour of TV a day and it killed me.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:10.560]   It was so pissed off.
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:13.400]   You can always talk to my new editor at another publishing company.
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:17.440]   I'll talk about that next week, but she was very much into Neopets.
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:18.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:19.920]   So was my daughter.
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:31.240]   So she talks about it as kind of a idealistic world and all the skills she learned.
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.680]   And she's elegiac about it.
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:34.240]   It was really interesting to listen to.
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:38.160]   I told her that I'm not a gamer and don't know.
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:42.040]   But did you ever read tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow?
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:44.040]   Which is it?
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:45.040]   I think.
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.040]   Okay.
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:53.800]   I think there's a whole generation of web designers who learned how to design for the
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:59:02.800]   web on Neopets and Myspace because both of them let you use HTML to design your page.
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:05.840]   And my daughter's 30 now.
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:10.080]   So 30 year olds grew up playing Neopets and doing Myspace.
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.520]   And Neopets girls are girls boys.
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:14.120]   It was mostly girls, I think.
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:15.400]   I was really worried about Abby.
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:18.800]   She was maybe 10 when she was doing this.
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:20.760]   And I told this story before.
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:25.200]   I said, you know, I'm the tech guy privacy.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:29.120]   You don't want, you know, are there any adults on there talking to you, things like that?
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:30.680]   She's dad.
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:33.520]   On my account, I'm a 33 year old guy from Detroit.
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:37.440]   I drive a, I drive a, what did she say?
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:39.760]   Some sort of muscle car.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:40.840]   I'm safe.
[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:41.840]   She did not.
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:42.840]   She was smart enough.
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:44.400]   Even at that age did not in 20 years ago.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.000]   Yeah, we don't give a credit.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000]   Yeah, I get credit.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000]   It's credit.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.720]   I wonder if is Neopets still around?
[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:50.720]   That's so funny.
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:53.320]   The year editor, she must be in her 30s, right?
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.080]   Neopets is going mobile.
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:58.320]   What a surprise.
[01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.520]   So it's still around.
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:00.520]   Still play.
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:01.520]   Big community.
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:02.520]   It's a load in Neopets.
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:03.520]   Oh, do they own it now?
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.520]   Ah, there you go.
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:05.520]   I don't know.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.520]   Where did you see Nick?
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:07.520]   Rathole.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.520]   Rathole.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:09.520]   Okay.
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:10.520]   Let's not go in that.
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:11.520]   Let's.
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:16.520]   Let's jump out of that.
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:20.800]   Let's see.
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.360]   You put a lot of stories in here.
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:25.800]   Well, we got, well, what's your feeling on this wire, the wire?
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:27.840]   Now, this is not wired.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:30.720]   This is a site called The Wire, which I'm not familiar with.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:31.720]   Is it Indian?
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:32.720]   It's India.
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:35.520]   It's an independent news site in India.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:38.280]   And it's a very complicated story.
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:44.840]   But basically what happened was they had a leak from Facebook meta, all kinds of bad
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:46.000]   stuff happening.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.400]   And Facebook meta, which oftentimes ignores these things, came out very explicit denials
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:51.800]   of this.
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:55.840]   And then as it turned out, the wire was, was gamed by somebody.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:56.840]   It could have been.
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:01.840]   The wires went denied it, denied it, denied it, and then said, oh, and finally said, oh,
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:05.480]   and so no one knows yet where this came from.
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:09.920]   Was it an external force trying to make the wire look bad?
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:12.840]   Was it a fabulous within the company trying to make things up?
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:16.840]   And they're not sure yet, but it's now, the evidence just piled up about how this stuff
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:18.920]   was obviously fake.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:22.840]   They say a member of their meta investigation team is responsible.
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:25.680]   So they're, they're blaming, this is from the Verge.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:28.080]   They're blaming a staff member.
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:31.720]   It was subject to deception by one of the members of its meta investigation team.
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:35.920]   That was updated, a post updated today.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:40.480]   They said meta had granted an Indian politician special privileges on Instagram.
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:41.480]   Right.
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:44.000]   So this is more than just a fabulous story.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.360]   It goes into the very complicated politics of India.
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:52.680]   And I have two students from India right now in our engagement class and they're worried
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:59.360]   about kind of a last outlet of independent media now being questioned its credibility
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.840]   and what that's going to do to the news ecosystem there.
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:07.960]   Audio is the white whale of social media proclaims protocol.
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:13.560]   A TikTok or Twitter like platform for audio recording sounds like a solid bet on paper.
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:16.080]   Can you say clubhouse clubhouse?
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:17.880]   I don't remember clubhouse.
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:22.360]   Some day we'll have somebody on and said, yeah, I was there at clubhouse.
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:24.120]   Let me tell you what really happened.
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:26.040]   Audio is intimate and imaginative.
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:30.120]   The stakes are lower, the costs are more accessible compared to recording video content.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.120]   Best of all, social audio appears to be new and exciting like it's never been done before.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:39.400]   Well, protocol says actually it's a lot harder.
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:40.400]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:45.880]   Then you think at least until you nail the AI discovery and audio clipping technology.
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:50.560]   And that's what interested me about that is there's a lot of talk now about extracting
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.920]   content using AI to extract.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:55.880]   Oh, they when they say clipping, they mean taking little clips out.
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:58.880]   Taking clips of the audio and also doing discovery.
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.160]   They should have talked to me.
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:04.760]   That's problem number one and has been from day one in podcasting and I knew it because
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:07.120]   it's a black box.
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:11.400]   You can't, you know, if I'm typing a tweet, somebody can quote it, you can read it.
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:16.520]   But what happens in a podcast days in a podcast because there's no easy way to share that.
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:22.600]   Can't you use captioning now to do a text search on it such that we've tried?
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:23.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:24.600]   What is it?
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:25.600]   What happens?
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:27.080]   It's too inaccurate or?
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.080]   No, no.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.720]   I think it's not easy enough.
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:32.400]   Remember there were a number of attempts.
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:34.160]   Google had a yeah, the other one.
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:36.920]   Text search engine for podcasts didn't go anywhere.
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.040]   I was very hopeful because discuss that's the second side of that is discoverability.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:42.040]   You can't share it.
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:43.040]   Yes.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:44.040]   But also people can't search for it.
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:48.640]   You know this if this show all you would see on the metadata for the show is Leo and
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:52.840]   Jeff talked to rabble, maybe a little bit about scuttlebutt or planetary.
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:54.840]   It's going to be a sentence or two.
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:58.640]   That's the only searchable part of the show.
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:03.520]   And you know what I'd love is a clip of the Maori usage of staff.
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:05.640]   So you have staff has to do that very many.
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:07.600]   Somebody would have and some we do have we pay people.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.600]   You do that.
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:09.600]   You do that.
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:10.600]   And they put it up on Instagram and they put it up on Twitter.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:12.200]   I don't know how valuable it is.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.880]   We feel like you have to do that.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:19.160]   But you can't but in other media your fans will do it right?
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:20.600]   They don't have to worry about it.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:21.600]   They'll share it.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:24.600]   So I agree that this is kind of a problem is discoverability.
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:26.040]   It's always been a problem in podcasting.
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.960]   If they've asked me I could have told them and we haven't figured it out.
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:34.260]   So we have two ways we have transcripts.
[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:37.880]   On the tech guy for instance we have a computer generated transcript search is surprisingly
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:38.880]   good.
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:41.760]   A human then goes through it and we post it.
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:44.800]   Steve Gibson has an actual human a transcription as Elaine Ferris.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.360]   It still amazes me to this day.
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:50.880]   He pays somebody to do it which he's smart and it's on his site.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:54.120]   And so it is searchable and you could even Google you could find out the Google but
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:58.880]   I don't think because it's not central to the search experience.
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:01.920]   Conversation is just not text.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:02.920]   That's the thing.
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:04.120]   Conversation is people going back and forth.
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:05.120]   It's context.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:06.120]   It's all kinds of other things.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:09.880]   It's one matter of when Ravel goes into soliloquy about the Maori.
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:12.280]   Okay that's definable.
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:16.640]   But when I read interviews with people I hate the interview format as text.
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:18.520]   It just doesn't work well.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:22.080]   Protocol asks will it ever be audio's time to shine?
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:26.880]   It's at a disadvantage in our short attention span economy filled with shiny images and
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.120]   the never ending scroll.
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:32.000]   I would submit that's exactly why people like what we do for instance.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000]   Yes.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.560]   It's not that.
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:39.440]   Listening is an inherently passive experience making it more difficult to sell to investors
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:44.440]   and the average user Cliff Lampia University of Michigan professor specializing in digital
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:49.120]   communications said we're doing something else when we're listening to audio right?
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:54.640]   That's not true with either reading or video because it grabs more of our attention.
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:55.640]   Okay.
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:58.200]   How do I consume half the books I consume?
[02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:59.920]   Yeah I'm not sure I buy that.
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:01.880]   But it's a different beast.
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:03.160]   That's why we like it.
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:06.120]   I think it's why people listen.
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:08.960]   Because we're keeping them company while they're doing something else.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:11.760]   And it's not, you know I used to listen to audio books while I played video games and I
[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:15.760]   didn't feel so guilty about wasting all that time on video games.
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:19.120]   So I just read a phenomenal book.
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:20.960]   It's depressing as hell.
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:26.160]   Called by Jonathan Friedland called the escape artist about one of the four Jewish prisoners
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:33.120]   who escaped Auschwitz and who did so to take the story outside and he memorized incredible
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:36.120]   detail.
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:37.120]   Phenomenal book.
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:42.040]   I'm trying to write a post about it because it's the best Holocaust Chronicle I've read.
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:45.720]   Point being I was so engaged in the book and the way I listen to books is by a driver
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:46.720]   driving.
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:50.840]   I drove around farther so I could get to the end of the book which waste I'm sorry to
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:51.840]   the environment.
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:52.840]   I'm sorry that's wrong.
[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:53.840]   I do that all the time.
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:56.440]   Well I sit in the driveway and turn off the engine.
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:57.440]   Okay.
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:06:58.440]   All right.
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:06:59.440]   Yes.
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.440]   I'm a responsible audio book.
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:03.720]   Is this what did you think about this?
[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:06.440]   Is Mr. Beast actually worth one and a half billion dollars?
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:08.040]   I don't know Mr. Beast.
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:09.920]   Have you ever watched a single Mr. Beast thing?
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:10.920]   No.
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:11.920]   I have it either.
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:12.920]   Mr. Beast.
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:17.460]   We know about him because Renee Richie who's now works at YouTube but Mr. Beast is a very
[02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:23.280]   well-known YouTuber who built a massive audience by giving away a lot of money.
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:24.440]   A lot of money.
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:25.440]   And he's done other things.
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:27.680]   He had, let me see if I can find a video of this.
[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:29.520]   It'll give you some idea.
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:31.720]   He had a hamburger.
[02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:32.720]   Mr. Beast.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:35.920]   I mean I don't know why he's famous for hamburgers.
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:36.920]   He shouldn't be.
[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:37.920]   It's like the old days of game shows.
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:39.320]   Your famous will be in the famous.
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:40.920]   Yeah.
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:44.440]   He had a pop-up hamburger at a mall.
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.880]   Let me show you the video.
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:47.720]   That was right here in New Jersey.
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:50.280]   And then tens of thousands of people showed up to a burger.
[02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:51.200]   It's just a burger.
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:52.200]   It's just a burger.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:53.600]   They filled them all.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:54.600]   10,000 plus.
[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:57.360]   But it's a celebrity meets burger.
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.360]   Yeah.
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:01.440]   Yeah, it's bizarre isn't it?
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:05.360]   Here's Mr. Beast himself.
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:06.360]   That's the beast.
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:07.360]   That's the beast man.
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:08.360]   He says, me.
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:09.360]   Don't show up.
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:10.360]   Lots of people would be here.
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:12.360]   Guys, lots of people were there.
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:13.360]   Six point.
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.560]   Okay, just to give you some idea of his power.
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:21.720]   6.2 million views on this Twitter video.
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:23.600]   Let me play it against you and hear the audio.
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:25.560]   Can you hear the audio?
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:26.560]   There is no.
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:27.560]   There's the audio.
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:28.560]   Not even here.
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:29.560]   It's allowed.
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:30.560]   There's a crowd.
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:31.560]   It's like a rock star.
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:32.560]   The burger is probably loud.
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:33.560]   This is crazy.
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:34.560]   She's like a rock star.
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:41.320]   What's the story?
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:50.400]   She would happen with celebrity because he's not a celebrity of the likes of Taylor Swift.
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.320]   But he's a big enough celebrity to pull out 10,000 people and have 6 million views of
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:57.000]   the stupid video of doing nothing but waiting for a hamburger.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.200]   It's a whole different scale.
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:06.640]   So he's 24-year-old, his real name is Jimmy Donaldson.
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:10.720]   He makes kind of crazy fun, interesting YouTube videos.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:19.040]   And he is now trying to raise $150 million on a valuation of $1.5 billion.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:20.920]   Is Mr. Beast, you know what?
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:22.040]   I'm not going to invest.
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:25.240]   But if I were that kind of guy, maybe maybe-
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:28.800]   You know what we kind of think we're- remember we had Sam Lusson on a long time ago, where
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:30.200]   he was going to invest to the person?
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:32.200]   Yeah, whatever happened to that.
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:33.240]   I wonder what happened to that.
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:35.080]   I wonder what I do.
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:40.960]   He's got 109 million YouTube subscribers, the fifth most subscribed channel on YouTube.
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:44.040]   Top earners among US YouTubers.
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:49.120]   He has five other channels with another 82 million subscribers, three Spanish language
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:51.360]   channels.
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:57.160]   I'm sure he makes a ton of money himself.
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:09:58.160]   Right.
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:03.240]   Besides the Mr. Beast burger, he's got a snack company called Feastables, which raised $5
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:07.240]   million on a $50 million valuation.
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:12.160]   But I guess if you invest in Mr. Beast, you get payoff.
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:14.160]   I don't know.
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:15.160]   Yeah.
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:22.960]   He did a real life squid game last year, 25 minute video, which many say was horrific.
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:27.480]   It required $3.5 million to produce this 25 minute video.
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:29.360]   Half a million in prize money.
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:35.400]   In other words, he spent more money on his real life squid game video than they spent
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:41.920]   on the squid game itself.
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:43.240]   So you got to admire the guy.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:47.720]   I mean, he's- Well, you know, it also, it even goes off the old magazine model, right?
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:51.520]   People would- would subscribe to Sports Illustrated, they'd get a free sneaker phone.
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:52.520]   Yeah.
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:54.520]   And so you ended up in the sneaker phone business.
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:55.520]   Yeah, no.
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:56.520]   You ended up in the giving away business.
[02:10:56.520 --> 02:10:59.800]   And that's the one thing that kind of for me undermines us a little bit is he has to-
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:02.840]   he's actually giving- so you gave away half a million dollars.
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:05.320]   I don't know how he bootstrapped this.
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:08.520]   He must have started by 10- giving away 10- I think he used to-
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:09.520]   Yeah, most of-
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:12.920]   As I remember, he used to go down the street and give bums money and stuff.
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:13.920]   And like say here's-
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:14.920]   Right.
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:15.920]   Here's out of dollars.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:16.920]   Change your life.
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:17.920]   I don't think he'd say "bum" anymore, Leo.
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:19.680]   Once a bum always a bum.
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:20.680]   It was a Stacy-
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:22.160]   Frank Sinatra called you a bum.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:23.160]   That's right.
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:24.160]   I have a bum.
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:25.160]   You are a bum.
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:26.160]   Yes.
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:28.160]   Who isn't showing ads now?
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:31.000]   Uber is going to show ads in the car.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.400]   I was in a taxi in Vegas ads.
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.320]   Yeah, New York's had them forever.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:37.880]   You've been trying to find out how to turn off the sound on the damn thing.
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:38.880]   So annoying.
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:39.880]   Oh.
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:46.440]   Apple, as you know, started putting ads in the today section of the App Store.
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:49.080]   And in fact, Marco Armit was very pissed off.
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:53.520]   He's a beloved Apple developer.
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:56.760]   And he makes a podcast player called Overcast.
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.960]   Let me go to his Twitter feed.
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:02.840]   Because this kind of says it all.
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:06.640]   And I'll tell you what, I think when Marco Armit says something Apple listens, because
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:09.480]   he's kind of part of that Apple community.
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:13.080]   Let me see if I can find his fanboys.
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.080]   Yeah.
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.120]   Basically, he's complaining about gambling ads.
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:21.040]   And everybody's complaining about gambling ads.
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:24.480]   But go up one in in the recommendations.
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:26.040]   No, no, no, no, it was it was being retweeted.
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:27.040]   Oh, stop there.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.560]   Now, what my apps product page shows there.
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:31.560]   Yeah.
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:37.440]   So what happens is, you know, I haven't seen this in California, maybe because we have
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:44.440]   not yet approved Prop 26 and seven, which allow betting, sports betting in California.
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:45.440]   It's still illegal.
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.280]   You have to go to a casino or a racetrack to bet.
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:54.200]   So maybe that's why because these, these are apps that let you gamble on your phone.
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:55.200]   Right.
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:58.480]   And by the way, I'm Jersey now, Lisa and I go back and forth on this.
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:12:59.560]   I'm voting no on this.
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:00.560]   I hate this idea.
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.960]   Oh, I hate this.
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:04.000]   It's a tax on on Schmucks.
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.760]   Well, it, and there's a lot of people with problems with gambling problems who are going
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:13.840]   to, this is going to be a casino in your palm is the I hate, I have long, I hate the
[02:13:13.840 --> 02:13:14.840]   lottery.
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.840]   Yeah, I don't like the lottery either.
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:19.600]   People has announced they are backing down.
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:23.080]   They are going to now block gambling apps.
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:27.160]   What a mistake, but firm piece for the first three days of Apple advertising.
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:30.440]   Oh, here's the, here's the Marko arm and tweet.
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:32.360]   It was a, I was already bookmarked.
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:36.120]   Now my apps product page shows gambling ads, which I'm not okay with.
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:37.400]   Apple shouldn't be okay with it either.
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:42.040]   The app store has corrupted such a great company so deeply.
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:47.880]   They make so much money from gambling and manipulated, manipulative in app purchases.
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:50.840]   They don't even see the problem anymore.
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:54.160]   And by the way, watch, watch what they're going to do with data.
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:58.160]   Your data is not safe on Apple anymore because they're going to start maximizing it.
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:59.400]   They're not going to call it targeting.
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:00.400]   It's targeting.
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:01.400]   Absolutely.
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:02.400]   Yeah.
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:05.880]   Although why if you listen, if you want to download the overcast podcast player, you'd
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:07.720]   be interested in sports betting.
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:10.200]   It might be, it's a beyond me.
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:11.720]   I know why Apple's interested.
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:14.480]   They get 30%.
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:18.960]   In app purchases have become a huge money maker for Apple.
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:19.960]   That was interesting.
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:25.000]   I brought in British publishers to talk to American publishers when it became legal in
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:28.960]   the US because they've had bookies for ages.
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:33.160]   And the interesting thing was that the, that the, that the, they admitted that it's a terrible
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:37.600]   conflict of interest because you make money if your own readers lose money.
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:38.600]   Right.
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:39.600]   You end up in that, in that position.
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:43.240]   It's a terrible place for a newspaper to be is hoping that your readers are stupid enough
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:44.840]   to lose money.
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:50.360]   So Google announced that they were going to work on a system that would allow political
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:58.120]   campaign emails to get around the spam filters because for a long time, the courts have held
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:04.040]   and it's, you know, part of our first amendment that political campaign messages are not spam.
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:07.360]   They are, they are political speech.
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:12.560]   So in June, Google launched this program, the federal election commission approved it.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:19.240]   It was launched last month, except the Republican national committee never signed up.
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:20.840]   The others, other people sign up.
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:24.120]   The RNC just ignored it.
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:25.120]   Why?
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.360]   I think because they wanted to sue them.
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:34.520]   They have now filed a lawsuit against Google for putting RNC campaign emails and spam folders.
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:41.200]   Even though Google gave them away around it and they decided not to do it.
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:42.200]   What's the game?
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:43.960]   Oh, I know what the game is.
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:45.360]   You know what the game is.
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:46.600]   Big tech bad.
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:47.600]   Yeah.
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:48.600]   Yeah.
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:49.600]   Big tech bad.
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:51.440]   Yeah, exactly right.
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:52.680]   Um, moral panic.
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:53.680]   Where's Ant?
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:56.000]   What is moral panic, son?
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.280]   And I'll be back next week.
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:02.520]   I have been playing with the brand new Facebook Oculus Quest Pro.
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:05.200]   I guess they don't use Oculus anymore.
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:08.360]   Um, it came yesterday.
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:13.160]   This is the most expensive VR helmet I've ever purchased.
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:15.120]   I think it's one of the most expensive on the market.
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:16.120]   Six times again.
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:17.120]   $1,600.
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:19.680]   But it's not tethered.
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:21.520]   It's got much higher res screens.
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:23.000]   It's got better cameras.
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.720]   The cameras can see your hands.
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:27.640]   They have controllers, but you don't have to use the controllers.
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:32.120]   And the cameras are in color and you can see the outside world kind of a low res version
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:33.120]   of the outside world.
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:34.120]   So it's a little weird.
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:35.120]   It turns the world on its head.
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:39.960]   Like the real world looks like a fake world and the fake world looks like a real world.
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:44.240]   So it's a little weird, but you know, you can at least walk around without walking in
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:46.240]   the walls.
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:48.320]   And I'm actually quite impressed.
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:52.240]   I can see that if the application that would augment the real world.
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:54.200]   Well, here's the funny part.
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:59.960]   They offer a whole bunch of productivity apps, none of which I have any interest in.
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:03.040]   No, I'm not going to do my Microsoft Word there.
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:05.320]   I'm not going to have team meetings there.
[02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:08.200]   I don't want to wear it more than just plain.
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:10.480]   So I played a dancing game.
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:12.240]   Beat since we want video.
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:13.720]   We demand video.
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:17.320]   It's probably looked pretty, pretty stupid.
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:18.320]   Yeah.
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:19.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:20.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:24.480]   Actually, I think Lisa posted on her Twitter a video of me with the first game.
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:26.760]   Say inside to it.
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:27.760]   Okay.
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:28.960]   Thank you.
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:33.880]   Let's post it on our promotional Twitter feed inside to it.
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:38.240]   I first set it up and the first game I played.
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:39.240]   What?
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:41.480]   Oh, you pinned this old tweet.
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:42.880]   That's an old one.
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:43.880]   Here's the new one.
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:48.880]   First game I played, you have a virtual like lizard that you can pet him.
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:51.080]   Here, let me turn on the sound.
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:52.080]   You can pet him.
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:53.880]   Free mushroom tree.
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:54.880]   Here.
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:55.880]   Okay.
[02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:56.880]   So you're starting to play a game.
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:57.880]   It's a little lizard.
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:58.880]   I'm in a space.
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:17:59.880]   It's raining out.
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:00.880]   I'm like in a castle.
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:04.800]   There's a giant like tree mushroom tree.
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:08.600]   And there's this animal.
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:09.600]   And you cook.
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:11.560]   You cook for the animal.
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:12.560]   You throw a fetch.
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:13.560]   There's a fetch.
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:14.560]   There's a fetch.
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:16.560]   Yeah, it's kind of the full size game.
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:17.560]   It's the game you're playing.
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:18.560]   It's called bo-go.
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:19.560]   Bo-go.
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:20.560]   Bo-go.
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:22.040]   Buy one, get one free.
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:24.600]   It sounds like Lisa is your therapist.
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:25.600]   Yeah, she's trying.
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:29.520]   She went to bed and I...
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:32.920]   Where can I get an apple?
[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:34.400]   Okay.
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:35.400]   It's inevitable.
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:37.400]   There's no way you cannot be a dork using these things.
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:38.400]   Yeah.
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.400]   Yeah.
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:41.200]   But inside, life is wonderful.
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:42.760]   So I understand we...
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:45.360]   Are you going to sell these?
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:49.160]   They're in the store with twit.tv/store?
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:52.320]   Okay.
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:53.760]   In the twig slack.
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:19:04.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have now created a t-shirt in the twit store, the real chieftoid.
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:06.120]   Take that, Elon.
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:08.480]   I want everybody to go to...
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:13.420]   Get this shirt and wear it over to the Twitter headquarters.
[02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:14.580]   Take that, Elon.
[02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:15.580]   The real.
[02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:18.040]   I'm the real, the one, the only, the original.
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:19.040]   So I wasn't sure.
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:21.840]   Should I change my Twitter handle to the original chieftoid?
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:23.240]   But you said the real chieftoid.
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:24.480]   I said real.
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:27.440]   So thanks to you, we now have a t-shirt.
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:29.480]   I don't have to buy one.
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:30.840]   We'll send you one.
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:31.840]   No, I'll buy one.
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:34.840]   That might be your Christmas gift.
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:38.320]   Oh, boy.
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:43.560]   This is easier without Stacey getting mad at me for saying things like whatever it was
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:45.560]   I said.
[02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:53.200]   Texas also, you know, the headquarters of the anti-big tech movement, especially Ken Paxton.
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:20:00.120]   The Kuku, attorney general of the great state of Texas, now suing Texas, sorry, suing Google
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:03.600]   over the use of facial images.
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:10.680]   They said, "You didn't obtain user consent for biometric data use in the Nest cameras,
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:14.920]   for instance, which identify people when you come to your door.
[02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:16.720]   They've already sued Meta over this.
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:21.280]   In fact, Meta discontinued its use of face recognition technology.
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:24.040]   Last year, that is scared.
[02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:25.360]   That is scared of Texas.
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:26.560]   Maybe Google should, too.
[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:30.720]   Google, Texas alleged Google had used features in Google Photos and Google Assistant as well
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:35.320]   as its Nest smart home products to collect and store facial and voice recognition data
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:37.480]   without obtaining proper consent.
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:41.760]   I'm not sure what proper consent is, but I know when I do the face recognition.
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:46.760]   I mean, I know I'm told, like on my Nest camera, it said this may be illegal in some
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:47.760]   states.
[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:51.200]   Don't, you know, you're going to be doing face recognition.
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:55.440]   Texas has a law passed in 2009, kind of like Illinois's biometric consent law.
[02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:59.800]   The capture or use of biometric identifier act outlawed the collection and sharing of
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:03.080]   biometric information in the state without informed consent.
[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:06.160]   I actually don't think that's a bad thing.
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:10.640]   Google previously agreed to pay $100 million in a clash action lawsuit in the Illinois
[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:12.640]   because of the Illinois privacy laws.
[02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:14.320]   What about Apple on your phone?
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:15.760]   Is it because it stays on the phone or?
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:17.160]   It stays on the phone.
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:18.160]   That's exactly right.
[02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:24.520]   Apple's very careful to make sure that that information stays on your phone.
[02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:26.000]   Which Google usually does.
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:27.000]   Or not.
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.000]   Now, let's see.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:34.480]   Can't because if you're doing Google photos, I guess you could do it on the phone.
[02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:35.480]   Apple does it on the phone.
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:37.480]   I guess you could.
[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:38.480]   Yeah.
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:41.840]   So maybe, maybe Ken Paxton isn't all wrong here.
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:45.840]   Well, I hate to give him a benefit to the doubt.
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:46.840]   No, no, no, no.
[02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:47.840]   No.
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:48.840]   All right.
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:51.200]   What else do you want to talk about?
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:53.280]   Do you want to do a change log?
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:54.960]   No, I really don't.
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:55.960]   Okay.
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:56.960]   Is there a change log?
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:21:57.960]   There is one.
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:21:58.960]   I'm trying to think what's in there.
[02:21:58.960 --> 02:21:59.960]   I'll do it.
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:00.960]   YouTube has to read around.
[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:01.960]   I'll do it real quickly.
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:02.960]   Play the thing.
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:03.960]   Okay.
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:04.960]   All right.
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:05.960]   The Google change log.
[02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:09.640]   I'll do this really quickly.
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:15.160]   Google Home Web App starts rolling out to view live nest feeds.
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:24.000]   I have this is kind of this is a new game we're going to play on the Google change launch.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:25.000]   You understand the change log.
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.840]   Read the headline and then you tell us Google Home Web App starts rolling out to view live
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:35.640]   nest feeds, older cameras supported.
[02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:37.360]   I can always view my live nest feeds.
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:38.360]   It's really amazing.
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:40.920]   But I guess it means you can watch your camera in nest.
[02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:43.160]   I could always I could always do that.
[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:44.160]   Yeah.
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:50.360]   Good next next Google Maps has removed its COVID-19 layer mission accomplished.
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:51.360]   It's over.
[02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:52.360]   Oh, geez.
[02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:55.520]   Meanwhile, three of my faculty members, my sister just got it.
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:56.520]   Take off your mask.
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:57.920]   Everybody gets over.
[02:22:57.920 --> 02:23:03.040]   You are in the new BQ one arena.
[02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:04.040]   Yes.
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:10.680]   In fact, I just read a report that New York's rate of BQ one, which is the new variant of
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:11.680]   concern.
[02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:13.480]   It doubled in the last week.
[02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:18.560]   It was 8% of the infections last week is 17% this week.
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:21.800]   So that's a lot.
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:22.800]   It is.
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:27.360]   This one is my wife said that Peter Hotez, who's the brilliant doctor from Texas said
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:34.840]   that there's so many various now we're into scrabble high value letters.
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:35.840]   Good line.
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:36.840]   Okay.
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:37.840]   Yeah.
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:38.840]   Where your mask get your backs.
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:41.120]   I got an appointment for the my fifth shot.
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:44.520]   I got the fifth shot number five on Tuesday.
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:45.520]   Wow.
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:46.520]   Wow.
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:50.480]   And I and I have had it should count a little bit, right?
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:53.840]   Two of our employees had it.
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:24:00.240]   One of them completely symptom free didn't even know he had it at a PCR test and oh, look,
[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:01.760]   you have COVID, but I don't have COVID.
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:05.080]   Well, you must have because the test sets you do.
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:07.520]   And another one I think got sick at a wedding.
[02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:10.640]   So we're going to write my sister goes to theater and dinner.
[02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:11.640]   We were in Vegas.
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:13.240]   I went to Vegas for three days.
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:14.240]   Well, that's right.
[02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:15.240]   You do go to Vegas.
[02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:16.240]   I gambled.
[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:17.240]   So here's the stupid thing.
[02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:21.680]   Lisa, you know, whatever my spouse does, I got to do and and whatever she doesn't do.
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.720]   I can't do because if she gets it, I'm going to get it.
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:26.120]   So we have to kind of all rights.
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:29.120]   We have to kind of agree on what it's like both of you eating garlic.
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:30.280]   So you don't bother each other.
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:31.280]   Exactly.
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:32.280]   Right.
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:39.040]   So we both wore a mask airport plane airport hotel completely the whole time didn't even
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:40.240]   eat.
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:43.280]   Just just wear a mask.
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:47.200]   I think I'm going to sneak some nuts up under the mask.
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:51.240]   Get to Vegas and no one is no one.
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:52.240]   Of course not.
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:56.840]   And there's loud singing and shouting and dancing in the streets.
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:58.200]   It's all over folks.
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:01.840]   So we both took over a mess and we didn't wear them.
[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:04.960]   And then on the way home, we messed up for the airport again.
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:06.440]   I don't know.
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:10.200]   You were probably safe as to the airport, not in it because yeah, security theater.
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:11.200]   We played.
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:15.920]   We did slots and we did.
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:18.760]   I don't think I got sick.
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:21.560]   Google is giving workspace individual subscribers.
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:24.280]   No, this is not the story.
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:26.560]   A big story bump.
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:27.560]   Oops.
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:28.560]   Sorry.
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:29.560]   That's my fault.
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:30.560]   Yeah.
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:31.560]   It's going up to like one terabyte or something.
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:32.560]   Nice.
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:33.560]   It seems like it's two megas to gigs to one terabyte is huge.
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:35.200]   You didn't get a terabyte before?
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:37.520]   I have a workspace.
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:39.760]   The business accounts get a terabyte each.
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:40.760]   Yeah.
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:45.800]   And so I'm only just me, but two of my friends from I work, I haven't worked with for 10
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:46.800]   years.
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:48.840]   I gave them Buzz machine email addresses.
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:51.200]   So they're still on it and I'm like, I kick them off.
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:53.560]   So I'm still on the corporate thing.
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:56.160]   Did you know that YouTube had a redesign?
[02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:57.160]   I did not.
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:58.160]   I put this in there.
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:25:59.160]   I did not.
[02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:02.080]   It makes it easier to fast forward or rewind to the right part.
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:05.600]   It adds a subtle and very subtle ambient lighting effect.
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:07.000]   If you have the dark theme set.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.760]   Oh, that's why you don't know Jeff.
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:09.600]   Yes.
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:12.280]   Adjusting the apps color background to match what you're watching.
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:14.080]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:17.080]   And you can pinch and spench to zoom.
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:18.080]   That's cool.
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:19.080]   That's cool.
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:20.080]   That is an improvement.
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:23.960]   Zoom in on videos the way you do on photos.
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:26.800]   Oh, this, the scrubber is neat.
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:28.080]   You just touch it and it scrubs.
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:29.800]   Well, no, go back on that same video.
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:31.040]   Just go back a little bit.
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:33.280]   I can't tell which is the control.
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:35.440]   No, no, that's the, no, I can't.
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:36.440]   A stair scrubber.
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:37.440]   No, it's not a scrubber.
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:38.440]   No, that's a scrubber.
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:40.440]   Who's scrubber is it anyway?
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:41.440]   All right.
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:44.440]   I can't, there's no, I was dumb of me.
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:45.440]   Scrubber.
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:46.840]   Oh, it's a new scrubber.
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:47.840]   No, Jeff.
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:52.480]   That's the after weeks of testing weeks.
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:54.240]   How committed is that?
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:55.800]   We tested this for weeks.
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:57.720]   Is that two weeks?
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:26:58.720]   Three weeks.
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:00.360]   YouTube is introducing the ambient mode.
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:05.480]   This is what like high end home theater folks do.
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:12.000]   They put ambient lighting like from Hue and other companies behind their TV that adjusts
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:15.080]   to the action on the TV.
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:17.720]   So if it's so weird, but people do it.
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:20.920]   Scott, Scott, what can say does it?
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:21.920]   Thumbs down, John.
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:23.120]   John's giving it a thumbs down.
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:24.120]   Yeah, I agree with John.
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:25.120]   John's right.
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:27.080]   It's called a bias light.
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:29.120]   It's called a bias light.
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:30.880]   It does not change.
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:33.360]   Scott's the one who told me about the changing ones.
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:34.360]   He doesn't.
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:35.960]   He's probably everyday bias light.
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:36.960]   Okay.
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:38.800]   Thank you, John.
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:39.800]   He's defending Scott.
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:44.280]   He was very, he was very animated on that.
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:45.280]   Really?
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:46.280]   Why?
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:49.560]   Don't you defame Scott Wilkinson?
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:51.360]   Okay.
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:52.360]   A bias light.
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:53.360]   I got it.
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:54.360]   I got it.
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.480]   YouTube premium getting a price hike for family plans.
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:27:59.640]   2299 a month.
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:01.160]   See, this is interesting.
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:05.440]   So we're all being hit by inflation, right?
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:06.440]   Prices are going up.
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:07.880]   I understand the price of gas went up.
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:10.920]   I understand the price of carrots went up.
[02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:14.080]   I understand the price of, what is it?
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:15.080]   Crudetay.
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:17.440]   I understand that those went up.
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:18.600]   Oz.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:23.040]   But so I feel like this is a little bit of price gouging.
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:27.240]   Both Apple and Google raise the prices of their subscription plans.
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:28.240]   Yeah.
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:30.680]   Like, did your costs go up?
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:32.600]   Now suddenly?
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:34.880]   And why did those go up if they did?
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:37.960]   It's all, see, this company is just jumping on the bandwagon.
[02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:38.960]   Everybody's doing it.
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:39.960]   Raise the prices.
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:43.840]   Google Messages tests a new design for delivered and read indicators.
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:45.600]   Do you use Google Messages for your...
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:46.600]   Yes, I do.
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:47.600]   Okay.
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:48.600]   Because I don't have Apple.
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:49.600]   I'm not cool.
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:52.520]   Well, they also, they put a new...
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:54.000]   It disturbed me.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.040]   It got a new icon for Google Messages.
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:28:57.600]   And I said, "Where my messages go?"
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:28:58.600]   "Oh, it's new."
[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:00.640]   Yeah, that's the new thing, by the way.
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:02.840]   And I don't like it.
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:04.200]   Companies change their icons.
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:10.040]   Sometimes, like every day, they know every update, there's a new icon.
[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:11.280]   Don't stop it.
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:12.280]   Yeah.
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:13.680]   So this is the which one?
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:15.480]   This is the new one with the...
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:16.480]   No.
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:17.480]   Which is the...
[02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:19.440]   No, it has a little quote and a quote.
[02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:21.080]   Whatever you showed before had it.
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:22.080]   You have to...
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:23.080]   Oh!
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:24.080]   There it is.
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:25.080]   That's the icon.
[02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:26.080]   That's the icon.
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:27.080]   Ew.
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:28.080]   Yeah.
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:29.920]   It looks like double vision.
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:30.920]   Yeah.
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:32.400]   That's not a good...
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:34.920]   Oh, God.
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:37.920]   And also, is the speech bubble backwards?
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:39.600]   It looks like it's backwards.
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:41.840]   Shouldn't it be coming from left to right?
[02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:44.520]   Not right to left.
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:46.360]   Go look at a comic book.
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:48.400]   Sometimes the way the character is.
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:52.000]   Do they sometimes have the speech bubble coming out the left side of that?
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.000]   That...
[02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.000]   This is...
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:55.000]   It looks...
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.000]   Doesn't look right.
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:57.000]   Does that look backwards?
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000]   It looks like a P now.
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000]   Not a...
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:00.000]   That I won't see any difference.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:01.000]   It's a P.
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:02.000]   Go.
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:03.000]   And that's...
[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000]   The Google change now.
[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000]   We did it.
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000]   See that was worthwhile.
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000]   You did it.
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.000]   You stuck it out.
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:12.000]   I have one...
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000]   I have the world's fastest story.
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:15.000]   Okay.
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:19.360]   I noticed today that the New York Times got rid of tech from its nav bar.
[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:20.360]   I think that means something.
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:21.360]   Oh, God damn it.
[02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:23.000]   I don't know why.
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:24.120]   That's a bad sign for me.
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:25.720]   No, mine's got tech.
[02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:26.720]   It does?
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:27.720]   Look.
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:28.720]   Mine doesn't.
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:31.720]   Oh, it's because of you.
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:32.720]   I'm logged in.
[02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:33.720]   Are you logged in?
[02:30:33.720 --> 02:30:35.120]   Yeah, something logged in.
[02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:36.560]   They added on the right for mine.
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:38.760]   They added games, the athletic, cooking, and wire cutter.
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:40.320]   Or they had to take something out and they took out tech.
[02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:41.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:42.320]   Well, wait a minute.
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:44.560]   Let me do a hard refresh.
[02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:45.920]   You can watch the tech disappear.
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:46.920]   No, I still have it.
[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:48.960]   You're in an A/B test, my friend.
[02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:50.200]   I sure am.
[02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:52.440]   Because mine has world US politics, New York business.
[02:30:52.440 --> 02:30:54.200]   David Eisenberg said he didn't have it.
[02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:56.200]   He still had it, too.
[02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:57.200]   Yeah.
[02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:00.000]   No, you're in some sort of weird A/B test.
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:03.720]   Oh, they're seeing what happens if we started ignoring technology.
[02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:04.720]   It changes.
[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:06.960]   Better than covering it the way they cover it.
[02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:11.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, just a real quick plug to join the club.
[02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:14.560]   We had a very big night last night.
[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:17.360]   Cross the 5,000 member line.
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:18.360]   Yeah.
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:19.360]   But don't stop.
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:20.360]   No.
[02:31:20.360 --> 02:31:30.040]   I, you know, 5,000 members means if we have, I can't remember what our total reach is.
[02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:33.880]   I think it's four or five million a month.
[02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:35.840]   But how many uniques do you think we have?
[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:39.080]   Let's say it's a million.
[02:31:39.080 --> 02:31:40.080]   I wish Ravel were here.
[02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:41.840]   He could probably do the math on this.
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:45.760]   5,000 is .05%.
[02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:48.000]   I think or something like that.
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:51.120]   That's about a newspaper conversion rate now.
[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:52.120]   It's terrible.
[02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:54.920]   Time's conversion is up to like 3%.
[02:31:54.920 --> 02:31:57.520]   And public radio and public broadcasting about 5%.
[02:31:57.520 --> 02:31:59.080]   6 to 10%.
[02:31:59.080 --> 02:32:00.080]   6 to 10.
[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:02.520]   So I think we're going to start doing pledge breaks.
[02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:04.720]   No, I promise.
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:06.280]   No, I promise.
[02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:09.600]   Give money or Jarvis will start talking about Gutenberg.
[02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:11.840]   A Jim Neighbors box set.
[02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:13.840]   Every one of you is going to get.
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:15.840]   If you just subscribe, no.
[02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:19.000]   You get your real chief Twit t-shirt.
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.560]   The t-shirt give enough.
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:21.920]   No, we're not going to do that.
[02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:22.920]   No premiums.
[02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:23.920]   Look it.
[02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:24.920]   You know what you get?
[02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:30.840]   You get the good feeling that you're helping keeping this show and all of our shows on
[02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:32.040]   the air.
[02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:39.240]   We had one ad today and I hate to say it, but next year is really looking bleak right
[02:32:39.240 --> 02:32:40.240]   now.
[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:41.240]   We want to keep the lights on.
[02:32:41.240 --> 02:32:42.880]   We want to keep our staff employees.
[02:32:42.880 --> 02:32:44.360]   We want to keep doing the shows we're doing.
[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:48.320]   We want to add new shows and the club lets us do all of that.
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:50.800]   The club is $7 a month.
[02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:51.800]   That's not much.
[02:32:51.800 --> 02:32:52.800]   What do you get?
[02:32:52.800 --> 02:32:54.560]   Add free versions of all the shows because you're paying us.
[02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:55.760]   So we're not going to give you any ads.
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:57.960]   We wouldn't even hear this ad.
[02:32:57.960 --> 02:33:04.600]   You also get Twit plus bonus content stuff before and after shows and shows we make specifically
[02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:09.280]   for the club like the Hands on Mac show with Michael Sargent, Hands on Windows with Paul
[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:16.280]   Thorett.
[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:20.280]   We got some new shows in the works if you join.
[02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:21.280]   If you join.
[02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:24.280]   I really shouldn't downplay the most to me.
[02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:29.280]   The most wonderful thing about club Twit is the fabulous Discord.
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:31.280]   Wait a minute.
[02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:35.280]   Anthony Nielsen, are you going to offer club Twit 10% out?
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:36.280]   Check out.
[02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:37.280]   Wait a minute.
[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:38.280]   I don't understand what this is.
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:43.280]   Oh, if you use the offer code club Twit 10% off your T-shirt.
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:49.440]   Oh, there's this is by the way the thing you don't want, which is that lighting changing.
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:51.720]   It's your watching TV.
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:53.440]   You don't want to show it as a stop there.
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:54.440]   I thought it was too.
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:55.440]   I don't know.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:59.480]   No, if you want the T-shirt, use the offer code club Twit.
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:02.280]   So we this is the first time we've ever done this, but I think it's a good thing.
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:03.280]   10% off.
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:05.400]   It's only 22 22.
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:07.720]   So now it'll be 20.
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:11.200]   I think the gray is nicer or 1899 or something.
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:12.560]   Yeah, I like the gray.
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:13.560]   Well, you can look.
[02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:15.560]   There's all sorts of colors is purple.
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:17.360]   Ant would like that.
[02:34:17.360 --> 02:34:18.360]   There's light gray.
[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:20.360]   There's dark gray.
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:24.720]   There's it's been washed too much and it's starting to fade out gray.
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:25.720]   And there's no orange.
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:27.240]   Sorry, Ant.
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:33.320]   And colors by the way, I mean sizes because we know you go all the way up to five Excel.
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:35.280]   So programmer size.
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:36.280]   Here's the deal.
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:38.120]   That has nothing to do with a club.
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:41.600]   The club is the thing that's going to keep us going.
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:43.720]   And we really appreciate all of our club members.
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:45.920]   We're so happy to have 5,000.
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:47.600]   Thanks to all the individual members.
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:50.120]   We also have quite a few corporate members now.
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:54.440]   All the details, you can even buy individual shows for $2.99 if you don't want to spend
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:55.440]   $7.
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:57.600]   And I understand, look, I know money's tight.
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:34:59.600]   If you can't, don't worry, please.
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:03.320]   We continue to offer this show and all the shows we do add supported for free.
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:06.840]   We will do so as long as we can.
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:07.840]   Not a promise.
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:11.080]   We'll do it forever because honestly it's getting tight.
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:13.160]   It's getting tight out there.
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:15.560]   Club Twitter is it twit.tv/club.
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:17.400]   There.
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:18.800]   And no gym neighbors box set.
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:19.800]   I promise.
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:20.800]   Okay.
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:21.800]   Club Twitter.
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:22.800]   Twit.
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.800]   That's free.
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:26.280]   Free gas station sushi.
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:27.440]   Mailed.
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:30.280]   We'll express mail it.
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:32.160]   So it'll only be a few days old.
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:33.160]   How about that?
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:34.760]   What was that bread maker you had there?
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:36.600]   The Rotee machine.
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:37.600]   Rotee.
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:39.600]   Yeah, we got to the Rotee.
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:41.720]   Twit Rotee.
[02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:43.400]   I didn't make rabble do a thing.
[02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.720]   You see, you know what?
[02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:47.520]   Rabble's still here.
[02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:48.520]   Can I just say that?
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:49.520]   Are you serious?
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:51.520]   Yeah, he didn't leave.
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:58.440]   Oh, did you guys know that Twitter supporter, Club Twitter, has a higher rate of paying subscribers
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:01.920]   than either Snapchat or Twitter with Twitter blue.
[02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:04.480]   They're under like point two.
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:05.480]   Really?
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:06.480]   Percent.
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:07.480]   Yeah.
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:08.480]   Wow.
[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:09.480]   Well, then I-
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:11.120]   So you're doing better than Snapchat and Twitter?
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:13.320]   As we should.
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:14.320]   I rabble.
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:15.320]   It's so nice to see you.
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:16.320]   Hi.
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:17.320]   You like to hang it out.
[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:18.320]   I like this.
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:21.320]   This is like somebody who calls the people who call in the Howard Stern and say, "Can
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:23.400]   I stay out a hole so I can listen to Howard?"
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:24.400]   Aren't you bored?
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:26.480]   Well, we're glad you stuck around.
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:28.880]   No, no, it's fascinating.
[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:31.880]   You're seeing the sausage get made, I guess.
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:32.880]   It's the thing.
[02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:33.880]   All right, we've adjusted.
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:35.880]   You're talking about all these stories.
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:36.880]   Geez.
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:37.880]   Yeah.
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:40.240]   If I'd known, I would have podged you up and brought you in.
[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:41.240]   Is there a story?
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:42.240]   I saw you read the rundown.
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:44.320]   Is there any story we missed on the rundown you want to mention?
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:48.840]   No, the one thing that anecdote that I thought I might mention when you guys talking about
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:54.160]   like audio and breaking up the audio podcast and things like that is one of the prototypes
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:59.600]   we built at the same time that we built Twitter, we called ketchup, which was social voicemail.
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:04.120]   You'd call into a phone number and it would know who your contacts were and you would
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.600]   record a message and then you would hear the audio message of everyone who was one of
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:12.160]   your contacts, basically audio recorded Twitter.
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:13.720]   It was terrible.
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:15.160]   I love that idea.
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:16.480]   I want to do that.
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:19.760]   That's a great idea.
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:29.240]   But when I've been playing with GPT-3 and OpenAI and one-cast transcript, and trying to
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:35.320]   figure out how to take automated generated podcast transcripts and then convert them into articles
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:39.760]   because there's a known form by which you take an interview and a journalist builds an
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:40.760]   article.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:46.720]   And so many times we have all these podcast interviews that could be shorter formed condensed
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:47.720]   articles.
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:48.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:50.720]   Like the interview we just did with the end.
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:51.720]   It's formulaic.
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:52.720]   Yeah.
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:53.720]   Right.
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:56.880]   Like we know how you would take all of that concept and like some other information, put
[02:37:56.880 --> 02:38:02.120]   it together and you could produce a one or two page article out of it.
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:06.280]   And I just, you know, I have other things I'm doing.
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.280]   So I can't do it.
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:13.160]   As I like to say text is just another form of data visualization.
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:14.160]   Exactly.
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:19.280]   But, and then you could translate the transcripts into different languages and all of a sudden
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:24.880]   you'd have a whole bunch of articles about interesting things in a ton of different languages.
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:28.480]   I feel like we were just leaving all these ideas on the table here.
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:29.480]   Yeah.
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:30.480]   You know what's true though?
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:31.800]   I don't know if you have this experience.
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:34.240]   I guess you kind of alluded to it.
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:38.480]   There's a lot of things you can do in the world and no one has time to do them all.
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:42.400]   You know, and somebody creative like this comes up with a lot of ideas.
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:47.680]   You have to kind of jobs always said the most important part of his job was to say no.
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:49.840]   You know, no, we're not going to do that.
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:50.840]   It's a good idea.
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:52.680]   We're not going to do that.
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:58.080]   There's a guy in our chatroom, Gumby, who said he was here in your phone saying he said
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:03.280]   we did a project like that in Zimbabwe during the repression.
[02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:07.080]   We did voicemail ads, social networks to run under the radar because nobody was monitoring
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:08.880]   the phone network.
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:14.640]   I did that with a student in Nigeria where she was basically creating a radio station
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.240]   through phone calls.
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:17.640]   Cool.
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:21.640]   For a while there was, and I knew that they wouldn't go anywhere, you could listen to
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:23.640]   this show on the phone.
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:30.360]   There were people who contacted us and said we're going to give Twig a phone number and
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:32.520]   anybody wants to call that number.
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:34.320]   We'll hear the show.
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:36.800]   And I thought no one is going to do that.
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:37.800]   They didn't.
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:38.800]   I don't think so.
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:39.800]   I don't know.
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:40.800]   They may still offer the number.
[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:41.800]   Maybe there's still a phone number moving out there.
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:42.800]   I didn't say no.
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:43.800]   I didn't say no.
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:48.280]   I said if you want to do that fine, but I'm not paying for it.
[02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:49.600]   It's so great to have you, Rebel.
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:50.600]   Thank you for being here.
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:51.600]   I really appreciate it.
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:55.800]   I think if you have a pick of the week it should absolutely be planetary.
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:57.280]   It's a wonderful piece of software.
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:58.480]   I can't wait to play with it.
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:39:59.480]   Thank you.
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:00.480]   Yeah.
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:01.480]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:02.480]   It's great.
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:05.960]   Yeah, I cringe every time I watch someone over their shoulder use it because of all the
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:07.880]   usability problems and everything else.
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:11.640]   But we've got to start somewhere.
[02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:15.560]   Was it hard to get approval from Apple?
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:20.640]   We did get rejected a few times and had to, we had an argument about whether or not it's
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:25.360]   more like a web browser or more like a social network.
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:30.000]   That's why we added this callback system to a blacklist.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.560]   The only sharing with third party data we do is the stuff that Apple requires us to send
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:41.880]   data to Zen desk so that you can do reporting so you can do blocking.
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:47.400]   That part was a little tricky because they don't really understand that it's not a centralized
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:48.960]   network.
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:52.840]   I just got 15 unread posts and a bunch of people following me.
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:53.840]   Thank you.
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:54.840]   Thank you.
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:56.680]   You're going to hook me up.
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:57.680]   I appreciate it.
[02:40:57.680 --> 02:40:59.480]   I'll hook you up to Jeff.
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:00.480]   Thank you, Rabel.
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:01.920]   Jeff, what's your number of the week?
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:06.520]   Well, I got, Elleman has a new trust barometer special report for technology.
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:07.520]   They do what they do.
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:08.520]   This is trust barometer.
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:12.320]   Usually they reveal it in Davos when I used to go.
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:14.160]   And now this is just about technology.
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:18.520]   So 76% of people trust the technology sector.
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:19.520]   Wow.
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:20.520]   That's pretty amazing to me.
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:23.600]   And by the way, it is the most trusted sector.
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:24.600]   Wow.
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:27.640]   It's beverage, healthcare, manufacturing, retail.
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:33.640]   So all the, get ready, moral panic about how the technology is awful and everybody hates
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:35.400]   it.
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:36.400]   That's media's view.
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:38.000]   That's not the public's view.
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000]   That was my number.
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.080]   70% of you include in social media.
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:44.640]   Take us to go down a little bit.
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:45.640]   Oh, that's interesting.
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:51.000]   More too. 10% less likely to trust the tech sector if you include social media.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000]   But that's in developed markets.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:57.080]   Underdeveloped markets that may be very different because that's so important.
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:03.040]   Somebody sent me a really good series of conversations with one of our club members who lives in
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:09.200]   Nairobi who says, you know, you guys are a little, a lot.
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:10.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:15.840]   It's a little bit eccentric and, you know, he was talking about blockchain, which I've
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:24.080]   been kind of down on, but he says, you're seeing a lot of it in Africa, in UNICEF is
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:30.320]   backed a venture called Kotani Pay, which provides the infrastructure to pay a universal
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:35.000]   basic income to refugees living in camps in several parts of Africa.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:40.320]   It's not a lot of my $2 a day, but normally those funds notoriously, he says, those funds
[02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:42.600]   typically don't get to refugees.
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:44.840]   They're stolen by corrupt government officials a long way.
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:49.640]   But I don't want to know, Nigeria, the mobile phone payment system there is amazing.
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:51.040]   It's outside of China.
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:52.120]   Well, there's Empesa.
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:53.120]   That's right.
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:54.120]   Yeah.
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:57.280]   And he talks about Empesa because he also says, you know, this idea of creating a WeChat
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:42:59.520]   in the US isn't so far fetched.
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:07.560]   There are these X apps in China, obviously in India, in Kenya, and they're used by billions
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:08.560]   of people.
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:09.560]   So yeah, true.
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:10.560]   Anyway, Jay, thank you.
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:14.520]   I appreciate your thoughts and we will speak in a blockchain.
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:19.640]   There was a little thing more somebody I think it was because Moto tried to say that
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:23.800]   blue sky was blockchain and Jay Grayber had to come on Twitter and say, no, it's not.
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:24.800]   Oh, yeah.
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:26.280]   I know blockchain.
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:28.640]   This ain't blockchain.
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:31.320]   We get all that that all the time with planetary and scuttle.
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:34.360]   But as well, it's like we use a legend of the blockchain technology.
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:37.760]   I call us of blocking Jason, but there's no mining.
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:39.160]   There's no consensus.
[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:45.280]   We don't have a single unified chain and we don't, you know, we don't require there to
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:50.760]   be financial transactions for everything because it doesn't need to be unified like that.
[02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:51.920]   Are you not struggling?
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:52.920]   Absolutely, right.
[02:43:52.920 --> 02:44:01.960]   Jay is a great article on called Web3 is self-certifying, which talks about how the Web3
[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:06.320]   hurt positioning is that Web3 can be, it's all self-certifying technologies where you
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:09.920]   create your own keys and you validate yourself and you're validated with others, some of
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:15.360]   which are blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, but a bunch of which like scuttle but planetary
[02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:18.520]   and blue sky are not interesting.
[02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:23.480]   There is and I guess I should point you to Bloomberg Business Week this week, the issue
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:28.840]   takeover by Matt Levine, a 50,000 plus word story.
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:34.920]   It's all about crypto and what it means and what it is and I've been told by people who
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:40.040]   read it, I haven't gotten around to it, but I shall that this is a very good primer for
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:48.120]   people who want to know more about what's going on in crypto and in DeFi and in blockchain.
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:51.400]   Matt Levine is very good at this, so I think this should be a well worth reading.
[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:52.400]   That would be my pick of the week.
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:53.400]   How about that?
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:54.400]   That's there.
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:57.600]   Bloomberg Business Week.
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:44:59.600]   Thank you, Rabble, for being here.
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:00.600]   Thank you.
[02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:01.600]   It's so great to meet you.
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:02.600]   Thank you.
[02:45:02.600 --> 02:45:03.600]   Thank you.
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:04.600]   Thank you.
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:06.400]   His name is Camilo.
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:07.400]   Camilo.
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:08.400]   Hi Camilo.
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:10.760]   It's nice to see you on the Twitch.
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:17.480]   Do you think you'll make it through watching Dad or is it like every 15 year old guy saw
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:18.480]   enough?
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:20.000]   I don't know.
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:21.000]   Maybe he will.
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.680]   It is his lunch break right now, so he might be watching.
[02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:24.680]   Good.
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:25.680]   Camilo.
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:27.680]   Hey Camilo.
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:31.800]   And all the best is New Zealand still very COVID free.
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:37.720]   Is it still a very safe place to be?
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:42.040]   We got here during lockdown and had to go through the quarantine in the hotel and everything
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:43.600]   else.
[02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:48.360]   And by February, it had kind of escaped the quarantine system.
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:55.360]   So now New Zealand is basically the same as everywhere else except everyone's vaccinated
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:58.040]   and people follow public health rules.
[02:45:58.040 --> 02:45:59.040]   Yeah.
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:00.040]   Yeah.
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:03.360]   And I see in the chat that you helped out with that Zimbabwe phone network.
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:04.360]   Oh yeah.
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:06.360]   That was the funny thing.
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:13.160]   I was doing that and we also did an alert system.
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:19.800]   There was an NGO that was working with child soldiers in the Congo where they needed like
[02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:26.680]   so we set up this thing where we would set up phone numbers in Belgium that would ring.
[02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:30.720]   So you could call in Belgium because the Belgians of course were the former colonial owners of
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:38.400]   Congo and then it would ring to the local government officials in the Eastern Congo.
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:43.160]   And so these government officials just weren't doing anything about child soldiers and they
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:44.520]   weren't doing anything else.
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:49.920]   But we had NGOs on the ground who were like, we need people in this village and we need
[02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:51.800]   this stuff right now.
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:58.600]   And so we set up these phone numbers in Belgium and then got activists in Belgium to call and
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:03.360]   it turned out that like a person speaking French with a Belgian accent calling from Belgium
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:07.960]   freaked out the local government officials and they did stuff when they weren't just
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:13.040]   like they weren't doing anything when the locals said you need to act up.
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:17.120]   And it was a it was like a small little project but it was brilliant.
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:21.000]   It was like what can we do with phones to like change the world.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:27.640]   It turns out that like just routing phone numbers worked amazing.
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:28.960]   Pleasure talking to you, Ravel.
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:30.880]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you.
[02:47:30.880 --> 02:47:31.880]   Thank you.
[02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:36.240]   Buzzmachine.com at Jeff Jarvis and his new book is out from Bloone.
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:38.680]   No, it'll be out in June but you can preorder it.
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:43.440]   Is out in June is about what I was about to say from Bloone'sbury.
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:46.440]   You can order it at bitt.ly/buygootenberg.
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:52.800]   B-U-Y not B-Y, B-U-Y Gutenberg.
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:54.480]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:56.800]   We do Twig every Wednesday afternoon.
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:57.800]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:03.200]   I hope you'll join us next week, 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:08.240]   You can watch live at live.twit.tv chat live in our IRC at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:09.880]   That's where Ravel is.
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:13.600]   You can also chat with us on our Discord if you're a club member.
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:20.440]   And of course, get after the fact, copies of the show on demand@twit.tv/twig.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:23.520]   There's a YouTube channel dedicated to it and the best thing to do is be subscribing
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:25.320]   your favorite podcast player.
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:28.480]   So you get it automatically, the minute it's available.
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:29.760]   Thanks for joining us on Twig.
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:30.760]   Thank you Ravel.
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:31.760]   Thank you Jeff.
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:32.760]   We'll see you next time.
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:33.760]   Bye.
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:34.760]   Bye Camillo.
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:35.760]   Go back to school.
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:36.760]   Bye.
[02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:37.760]   Lunchtime is over.
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:38.760]   Go back to class.
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:39.760]   Go back to class.
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:40.760]   James, study hard.
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:41.760]   Bye.
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:43.160]   Hey, what's going on everybody?
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:47.600]   I am Ant Perit and I am the host of Hands on Photography here on Twit.tv.
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:53.720]   I know you got yourself a fancy smartphone, you got yourself a fancy camera, but your
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:55.720]   pictures are still lacking.
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:48:58.520]   Can't quite figure out what the heck shutter speed means.
[02:48:58.520 --> 02:48:59.520]   Watch my show.
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:00.520]   I got your cover.
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:06.120]   Wanna know more about just the ISO and exposure triangle in general?
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:07.720]   Yeah, I got your cover.
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:11.240]   Or if you got all of that down, you want to get into lighting.
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:12.800]   You know, making things look better.
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:14.800]   Not changing the lights around.
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:16.360]   I got you covered on that too.
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:17.360]   So check us out.
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:23.000]   Each and every Thursday here on the network go to twit.tv/hop and subscribe today.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:29.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:32.160]   (upbeat music)
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:34.240]   (gentle music)
