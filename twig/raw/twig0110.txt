[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.040]   It's time for this week in Google
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.920]   to show the covers, Google the cloud,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.560]   and really pretty much anything we feel like talking about.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.960]   That's because we have such a great team of people.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.000]   Now Jeff Jarvis is a way today.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.040]   He's taking Jake to college, which is kind of cool.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.480]   But Gina Trapani is here from a smarterware.org
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.400]   and ThinkUp app.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.800]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.640]   Oh, it's going great.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.560]   We brought in a nice bunch of people
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.920]   to-- took two people to replace Jeff Jarvis today,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.040]   starting all the way to my right from Life Hacker,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.080]   the editor in chief, Adam Pash.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.200]   Hi, Adam.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.960]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.760]   It's great to see you.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.520]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.400]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.440]   And from the Google verse itself, from the Plex, Mr. Chris
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.240]   Dibona, Chris's old friend, used to be regular on the screen
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.400]   savers showing open source software.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.960]   That's back when you were with SourceForge.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.240]   And way back when.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.160]   And in fact, was the original host of Floss Weekly.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.640]   I was.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.160]   Yes.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.280]   And it worked like that, according to Wikipedia.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.760]   Does it say that on Wikipedia?
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.440]   No, no.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.280]   It's actually true, though.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.560]   And then due to commitment issues--
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.760]   And I'm like, that sounds kind of--
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.400]   You were busy.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.160]   He didn't flick out.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.240]   Commitment issues.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.480]   I have problems with commitment.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.960]   Well, due to his problems with commitment,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.120]   he no longer hosts that show.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.520]   But that's because his commitments
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.840]   involve being manager of open source software for all of Google.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.440]   So that's a pretty big job.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.360]   It's a little tiny job.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.120]   You keep it tiny.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.280]   It's very busy, especially now, you know?
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.760]   So--
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.560]   Top story today, I think, is not a Google story,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.840]   except maybe peripherally.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.640]   And that is that the United States Department of Justice
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.680]   has now filed a complaint to block AT&T
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.800]   and its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.000]   With a B.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.880]   With a B, $39 billion saying it violates antitrust law.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.600]   I have to say this.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.840]   I can't remember when the last antitrust litigation
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.240]   happened in the US.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.200]   But this is a big deal.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.800]   And I--
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.680]   But let's start, I guess, with you, Gina.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.760]   Is this unexpected?
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.880]   Is this surprise you?
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.440]   I don't know that it surprises me,
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.960]   but as a T-Mobile customer, I'm sort of glad that I'm--
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.880]   We're thrilled, aren't we?
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.480]   --from an AT&T customer.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.360]   I mean, I think this kind of makes sense.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.800]   I really liked the idea of having more choice.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.080]   I really liked T-Mobile.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.480]   I used to be an AT&T customer.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.360]   I wasn't thrilled about the announcement of the merger.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.720]   I know that a lot of free market folks
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.200]   aren't-- don't like the idea of this regulatory agencies
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.240]   and stopping this kind of thing.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.400]   But I mean, I think it makes sense.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.360]   I think more choice is better.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.040]   Adam Pash, a surprise?
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.720]   I mean, I'm kind of cynical, so I always
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.120]   assume that stuff like this is going to go through.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   Me too.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.600]   But I'm likewise pleased.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.360]   I think it's generally going to be better for consumers.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.840]   And so I'm not going to complain.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.880]   But wait, AT&T offered to bring home 5,000 call center jobs.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.600]   That's not better for consumers.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.880]   AT&T said that this merger would allow them to put 4G and 97%
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.360]   of America.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.000]   That's not better for consumers or was that just a lot of smoke?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.680]   Well, I mean, the 5,000 thing is sort of--
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.720]   it seemed less like it had anything
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.400]   to do with the deal and more about like, hey, help us out.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.040]   And every night many Americans are struggling,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.640]   and our economy faces significant challenges.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.560]   We're pleased that the T-Mobile merger allows us.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.240]   We couldn't have done this.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.200]   No, no, no.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.600]   Couldn't have brought those jobs back.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.000]   But this merger allows us to bring 5,000 jobs back.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.640]   Of course, they don't mention how many jobs
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.280]   would be lost by the obvious duplication of jobs
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.920]   by the merger of the two companies.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.000]   Could be tens of thousands.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.080]   They say no, but of course, it's going to be jobs will be lost.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.280]   We also saw leaked memo thanks to their law firm that
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.000]   said that, well, if the merger doesn't happen,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.080]   then we wanted to put 4G and 97% of the US all by ourselves.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.760]   Could we do it?
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.000]   Oh, yeah, for 3.9 billion, 1/10 the cost, we could do it.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.160]   So I have to think that the Department of Justice
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.240]   might have just noticed this stuff and said,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.600]   this is not a good thing.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.240]   How do you call it-- can you call it an antitrust action
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.960]   when there are, in fact, four cell companies in this country?
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.000]   And this would only bring us down to three crystal bone.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.960]   I mean, it doesn't seem like that would make AT&T a trust,
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.240]   would it?
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.200]   Well, I think when I think about cell phone companies
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.120]   in the United States, I think of those that are running
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.880]   on the GSM frequencies.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.480]   And then I think of the ones that are running on the CDMA.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.360]   That's a good point.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.400]   It would be the only GSM.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.040]   So in CDMA, we have Sprint Nextel versus Verizon.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.320]   In GSM, we have T-Mobile versus Sprint.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.600]   And there's versus AT&T.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.840]   And there's no one else.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.840]   So what we're saying, basically, is that all GSM activity
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.800]   in the United States is going to go through one company
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.280]   if the merger goes through.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.800]   So that's a decision for the antitrust people
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.040]   and for AT&T and T-Mobile to talk about it.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.120]   It sounds like--
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.320]   This is a big win, actually, for Deutsche Telekom,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.080]   because there's a $3 billion fee.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.400]   Should this not get approved by regulators?
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.040]   That's cash that goes to Deutsche Telekom.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.040]   Wow, that's the kill fee on that one?
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.120]   That's the kill fee, $3 billion.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.480]   And-- and this is the part as a T-Mobile customer we like, Gina.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.640]   AT&T will provide T-Mobile USA with wireless spectrum
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.200]   in some regions and reduced charges for calls
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.760]   into AT&T's network.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.840]   So the kill fee, according to Deutsche Telekom,
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.640]   is as worth as much as $7 billion.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.280]   Ow, that's got to hurt AT&T.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   And it couldn't happen to an nicer phone company.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.000]   This is so sad, because really, I mean,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.160]   I don't know why I've got the knives out for them.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.360]   But nobody likes AT&T.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.280]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.520]   You know, I would also temper that by saying,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.280]   you're in the Bay Area where AT&T's network seems
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.680]   to be very oversubscribed.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.160]   That's actually true.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.040]   Like, you can't drive on 2A.D without dropping.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.800]   So there are some areas where people seem to really like it,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.560]   though, like Tampa, where my parents live.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.080]   AT&T seems like--
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.000]   Yeah, the heat map of AT&T,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.600]   the hatred, is definitely very red in the Bay Area, for sure.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.800]   Yeah, in New York.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.640]   So from a media perspective, everyone's like,
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.360]   right, AT&T, you know.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.040]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.080]   And New York as well.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.360]   I wonder if they make the GSM CDMA distinction
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.600]   in any of these filings.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.240]   It doesn't look like they did.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.480]   But I think that's a really good point to say this
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.080]   would make AT&T the only GSM choice.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.280]   I travel a lot internationally, so I try to--
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:30.800]   Right.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.160]   GSM.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.480]   Right.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.320]   That's why we have T-Mobile phones.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.480]   Yep.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.440]   I would guess, though, that the other issue
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.920]   is that would make AT&T by far the largest phone company.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.000]   They would leapfrog for Ryzen.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.960]   And the other issue is that Sprint now becomes really
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.520]   a laggard.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.120]   You have these two giants for Ryzen and AT&T.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.560]   And then the little bitty Sprint, which probably means
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.800]   that Sprint would get snapped up.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.560]   My-- here's an interesting question.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.280]   Regulators didn't approve this because it
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.920]   was a big phone company buying--
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.280]   not a little phone company.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.720]   Would regulators approve a T-Mobile acquisition by, let's say,
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.800]   Google?
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.760]   Or by-- in fact, we'd heard rumors that Google might be looking
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.400]   at Sprint or by, let's say, Apple.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.880]   And would Google or Apple even consider the idea of buying
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.720]   a phone company?
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.800]   I think a more interesting speculation
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.240]   is what if Sprint and T-Mobile got together?
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.920]   How weird would that be?
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.000]   Well, I wonder if that would get approved at this point.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.560]   I guess it would, because it would--
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.360]   that case would remind me of the satellite, a direct TV,
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.560]   and a dish getting together.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.400]   And the reason that was allowed, which clearly made a monopoly.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.840]   There's only one satellite--
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.160]   a small satellite company in the United States now.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.880]   But that was allowed because both companies were about to fail.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.920]   They were about to go on--
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.240]   Or like SiriusXM.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.200]   But it's not my--
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.440]   I'm sorry, not direct TV and dish.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.680]   SiriusXM, what am I thinking?
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.880]   You're absolutely right.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.520]   They were satellite radio, I should say.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.560]   Thank you for correcting me.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:55.920]   I don't know.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.240]   I was spending smoking pot.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.720]   I'll list it.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.640]   Because they were actually in financial trouble, those two.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:08:59.920]   They were.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.840]   They were about to go under.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.840]   That's not my impression.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.960]   Maybe Sprint.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.320]   I don't follow up very closely.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.760]   But T-Mobile seems to be doing great guns.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.560]   I mean, they're worth $39 billion, right?
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.520]   At least that much.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.240]   Google has been using T-Mobile for its Google experience phones.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.040]   The Nexus 1, the Nexus S. Adam keeps dropping out.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.480]   We're going to keep getting Adam back.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.120]   We'll get him back.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.320]   And I like it because it is GSM.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.360]   So I can use all kinds of different--
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.240]   I have the G2X.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   I have in my hot little hands a Samsung Galaxy 2,
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.040]   which is part of the story a little later on.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.920]   That's Eileen's phone.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.800]   And then also this HTC sensation.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.040]   These are all great Android phones.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.320]   I mean, I know you don't speak for Google, Chris.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.440]   I kind of do.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.560]   OK, I was getting you plenty off the hook.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.240]   He wants to.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.360]   I think it's kind of--
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.800]   I can't-- it's kind of specious.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.960]   There should be some--
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.360]   I would expect-- well, you don't speak for the phone division.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.760]   Let's say, or the Android division.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.360]   But there must be some happiness that T-Mobile will stick around.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.640]   I mean, that makes it easier for Google to make this--
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.400]   Yeah, I have no idea, honestly.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.360]   And it's too early to tell.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.560]   I mean, we saw the headlines this morning when you did.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.960]   We're like, oh, what would that mean?
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.160]   Right.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.320]   And there were rumors that the next--
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.920]   Trying to guess, one of the things I've learned working
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.640]   in this business and you probably know this too,
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.280]   trying to guess what the DOJ is going to do.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:23.800]   Wow.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.880]   It just--
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.120]   Who knows?
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.800]   The combination-- they said the DOJ said,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.400]   the combination of AT&T and T-Mobile--
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.720]   They didn't say it just like that.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.480]   Would result in tens of millions of consumers
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.560]   all across the US facing higher prices, fewer choices,
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.120]   and lower quality products for mobile wireless services.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.600]   Wow.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   That's--
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   Wow.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   That's strong.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.360]   And it's smart.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.000]   This is Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.760]   continuities on consumers across the country,
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.280]   including those in rural areas, which
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.200]   was part of the selling point on this,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.080]   and lower incomes benefit from competition
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.600]   among the nation's wireless carriers,
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.040]   particularly the four remaining national carriers.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.360]   They're saying something there too.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.080]   There's four remaining.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.320]   The lawsuit seeks to ensure that everyone can continue
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.120]   to receive the benefits of that competition.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.040]   Boy, I just have to say two thumbs up.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.480]   That's great.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:21.980]   That's great.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.440]   I wonder what Jarvis-- I'm thinking about what Jarvis would
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:24.960]   have to say.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.240]   He's going to be happy, right?
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:26.740]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:27.920]   I think so.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   I don't know.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.320]   We'll have to ask him next week.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.240]   He doesn't like too much regulation, so we'll see.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.720]   That's a good point.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.960]   But I think even if you're a libertarian,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.720]   and I've heard libertarian say this,
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.480]   the one area of government involvement that does make sense
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.960]   in the economy is prevention and monopolies, antitrust.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.360]   That's one thing you clearly need,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.760]   and it's one place that only the government can intervene.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.200]   The market, in fact, promotes trusts, promotes monopoly.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.440]   Yes.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.600]   So I think that even Jeff Jarvis may agree this is a good thing.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.280]   Google is looking at using plus one data.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.960]   I think-- tell me, Krista Bona, if this is a specious story,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.120]   some have said that this is just a specious story,
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.520]   that when the plus one button was announced,
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.800]   Google said we're going to use these signals to improve search.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.120]   And now, somehow, somebody got the notion
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.600]   that this is somehow something new,
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.920]   that Google's going to use the plus one button
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.640]   to re-rank search results.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.760]   Is this the same as what Google announced in the first place,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.480]   or is this some new way that they're
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.280]   going to use the plus one button?
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.960]   I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.840]   I didn't read it that closely, and I'm not Matt Cutts.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.880]   So maybe I missed some of the subtleties of this issue.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.560]   But it seems that we already said we were going to look
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.200]   at plus one data for search quality.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.120]   That's what I thought.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.120]   So--
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.620]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.160]   But it's August, right?
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.000]   So people are going to take old stories, make them sound
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   very random.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.280]   If everything was good again, Adam,
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.880]   have you been paying attention?
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.520]   Is this really, truly something new?
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.720]   Oh, we lost his audio.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.600]   Hello, Adam.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   Is it us, or is it Adam?
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.680]   He should be on now.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.320]   Adam, did you mute yourself, Dan?
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.360]   Adam, did you push that, did it, did it, did it,
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.280]   mute button on the hit, did it.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.440]   Do you want me to pretend I'm Adam?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:19.880]   I could--
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.640]   I work for Lycock.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   He doesn't talk like that.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.160]   Aw.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.680]   All right.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.200]   I'll tell you what--
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.160]   I don't like that.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.000]   Togethering.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.880]   Google's sent an email.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.600]   Can you hear me now?
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   Yeah, I can hear you now.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.880]   Yeah, Mr. Verizon, man.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.680]   You can look like that guy.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.720]   Sorry.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.120]   I think the main thing--
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.680]   the main thing now more about the fact
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.080]   that Google+ exists as an entity.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.480]   Isn't that sort of what the--
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.000]   Well, that's a confusion about plus one, isn't it?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.480]   Is it Google+ or what?
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.040]   Here's what Google said in an email to wired.com,
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.360]   Ryan Single Writing.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.960]   Google will study-- this is a quote--
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.600]   Google will study the clicks on plus one buttons.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.480]   Those are the buttons that websites have.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.400]   I have them online, where you, if you like an article
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.360]   or a blog post or whatever, you plus want it, right?
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.640]   Google will study the clicks on plus one buttons
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.840]   as a signal that influences the ranking and appearance
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.320]   of websites and search results.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.800]   The ranking and appearance of sites in web results,
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.680]   the purpose of any ranking signal
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.960]   is to improve overall search quality for plus ones
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.560]   and other social ranking signals,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.480]   as with any new ranking signal.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.960]   We'll be starting carefully and learning how those signals
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.960]   relate to quality, which, that all that makes sense.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.080]   But I would have thought the whole idea about plus one
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.240]   in the first place was exactly that,
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.560]   to get social signals into search.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.760]   Now, if you look at my search result for Leoville,
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.000]   this was a lab thing, right?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.160]   Gina, where you had a plus one that you could plus one
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.080]   a site, right?
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.840]   See, I'm not going to plus one that one.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.000]   Smoking hot, yeah.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.640]   Let me just--
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.040]   I don't think that's a lab feature anymore.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.560]   I think that that--
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.280]   Is that now?
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:04.960]   OK.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.160]   Yeah, it's a full rolled out feature.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.200]   So that's one way that we can plus one.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.480]   And then if I go to my site, because I've
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.640]   added the plus one button to blog post--
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.280]   let's go to a blog post.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.800]   This is another signal that a site operator can add.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.440]   This is where the good stuff is, right?
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.120]   Because if you're on a page-- this is the problem.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.680]   You don't want a plus one, a search result, in the results,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.480]   because you don't know if it's good yet, right?
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.200]   You have to click through.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.920]   But having the plus one on a page--
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.680]   Having a right here, right.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.520]   Yeah, and it also lets you share to Google Plus as well.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.600]   So not only does it add the plus one,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.520]   but you can then write some copies.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.520]   OK, I'm plussed it.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.120]   It pluses in minuses, you know?
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.840]   And then this is nice to share to Google.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.280]   It is.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.480]   You can share to your stream.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.560]   This makes complete sense.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.040]   I mean, this is just one more signal that Google's going to use.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.520]   This doesn't turn Google search results into dig.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.080]   I think that that's maybe the concern,
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.560]   is that people are going to try to game it.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.040]   And it's going to be whatever links to have the most pluses.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.320]   I mean, Google, at this point, the search engine,
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.160]   I'm sure thousands of signals that it uses to determine ranking.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.440]   It's not just going to be plus ones.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.640]   And I think we can--
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.840]   I don't know, maybe we shouldn't assume,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.720]   but I think we can pretty optimistically
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.480]   hope that Google has some really good spam or gaming
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.680]   prevention mechanisms.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   Right.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.280]   Because that would be the risk is that people go plus one,
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.760]   they're site-like crazy, right?
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.480]   Exactly.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.120]   Exactly.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.960]   I think the other thing though is that the Wired article
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.840]   tries to make the point that now that plus one is tied into Google
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.280]   plus, it incentivizes users to use Google plus over Facebook.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.200]   And I think there's a slight concern about that sort
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.720]   of competitive advantage.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.120]   Or at least that's what I think that's what I understood
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.280]   part of the point of the article to be.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.000]   So a plus one on Google plus would
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   be the same as a plus one on the page,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.680]   or sharing it on Google plus would be an effective plus.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.080]   So I don't know if that makes sense.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.920]   Do you think now plus one's something that--
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:04.280]   plus one's just this week, and they tie into Google plus.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.320]   You can plus one something, and it will automatically show up
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.840]   in your Google plus, like liking.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.000]   I don't know if it automatically does.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.080]   We saw that form drop down.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.880]   But so what you're saying is that if I am now on Google plus,
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.720]   and I look at Josh's post here that says the Bust 404 ever,
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.040]   if I plus one on Google plus, is that the--
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.600]   I don't think that's the same as plus oneing it on the page,
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.480]   or in the search results, or is it?
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.360]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.000]   I think it's more like-- so share would put it in just dream,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.520]   right?
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.400]   But plus one within Google plus doesn't.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   That seems like that.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.280]   But again, this is a useful signal.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.120]   But I think in that case, Adam, you'd
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   be right that that would over prioritize Google plus
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.560]   over other social signals.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.640]   I mean, clearly Google has social signal envy.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.840]   I mean, they look at what Facebook's doing,
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.240]   and I think the big fear is that Facebook, with all
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.920]   of its social signals, all of its metadata,
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.080]   all of its metadata on top of search,
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.280]   could ultimately outdo Google in some spaces
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.360]   if you were looking for a restaurant, or a recommendation,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.600]   or something like that.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.840]   But they also have the whole web indexed with every link
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.280]   from page to page.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.960]   So Google, really, if Google can incorporate some social
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.000]   into there, I guess Bing is the threat,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.520]   because Bing does incorporate the Facebook social signals
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.600]   into itself, right?
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:21.960]   Right.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.520]   Yep.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.000]   So what do you think, Adam?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.480]   I think this makes perfect sense.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.440]   If you're Google, why not incorporate this data?
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.040]   I mean, of course Google wants to make their product better,
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.240]   and they don't have access to Facebook's data.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.160]   Bing has that.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.840]   And they have to make do somewhere.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.160]   So it seems like a pretty obvious move for them.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.200]   I imagine after the Justice Department finally gruesome--
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.680]   teeth.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.360]   Teeth.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.080]   With this T-Mobile thing that now everybody's
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.840]   going to start thinking, hmm, is this going to be a cause
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.640]   for concern?
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.560]   This is why we have a lady on the panel.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.880]   So we soften some of those.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.040]   Teeth, they gruesome.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:04.560]   Exactly.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.720]   Teeth is what they grew.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.560]   Fangs.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.400]   Mixed company.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.080]   Now Forbes had a story that said, stick Google+ buttons
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.800]   on your pages or your search traffic suffers.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.880]   It was a story by Kashmir Hill.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.800]   Hill wrote about a meeting that he'd
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.440]   had with Google ad representatives
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.040]   and said, quote, the message in this meeting was clear.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.400]   Put a plus one button on your pages
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.280]   or your search traffic will suffer.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.560]   Forbes did kill that story.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.080]   And--
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.720]   This is my skeptical face.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.840]   Are you being skeptical?
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:49.480]   That doesn't sound like the company you work for.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   No.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.280]   I mean, you have 30,000 people in a company.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.360]   Somebody's going to say some wrong things now and then
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.560]   in a client meeting.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.060]   Right.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.120]   But that doesn't sound right.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.360]   I think that--
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.480]   I think the right--
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480]   And I'm sure that there's--
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.000]   So logically speaking, if plus ones add to your stream,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   which leads to more traffic from your fan base, OK.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.280]   Right.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.480]   Well, that's where you have to really walk a fine line, isn't it?
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.760]   You have to have almost like a Chinese wall between ad sales
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.120]   and the people who would like you to put a plus one
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.360]   on there for obvious reasons.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   And the search people who really say, well,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.760]   we want to take signals from every source
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.440]   and as best we can incorporate them into the search results
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.040]   because social signals do improve--
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.960]   a human-- this is so funny because it's
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.960]   almost coming full circle.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.640]   In the early days of search, Yahoo said humans
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.600]   have to create an index.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.360]   And then Google came along and said, no,
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.760]   you can do it algorithmically.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.200]   And now we're coming back full circle, which says, in effect,
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.560]   you can do it algorithmically with human signals.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.640]   It's not just an index.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.880]   You need signals.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.440]   These signals are incredibly valuable to search.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.280]   Well, it's a different--
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.440]   I would also point out if you think about it,
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.840]   like a website linking to another website
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.160]   is being done by a human, right?
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.640]   I mean, if you get back to the page rank--
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.140]   Right.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.800]   But I think the page rank did that
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.760]   because it was harder to gain, right?
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.560]   It was something out human intent, right?
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:14.880]   Right.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.400]   You want to assess human intent without signaling
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.480]   that you're assessing human intent.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.640]   And others harder to game it with page rank.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.120]   It turns out not to be.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.600]   But the theory was, well, if we explicitly say,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.480]   let's see what people do, then people
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.640]   are going to game us like they game dig.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.640]   But so what we should-- and this is with a risk with a plus one
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.080]   button-- has Google maybe come around to the notion that,
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.920]   A, we need this, and B, we've got a way
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.200]   to get around the gaming issue.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.120]   That's how we started this conversation.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.360]   You've got to get around gaming.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.560]   Yeah, I mean, yes.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.160]   You're absolutely right.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.240]   I mean, back in the day, I have to remember
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.360]   that Yahoo had a team of editors who
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.680]   were creating an index of the web.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.480]   It's just a scam.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   I don't know how many people they had.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.000]   Maybe a few dozen at most.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.520]   It's a scam.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   But now you have millions and millions of people
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.780]   and lots of algorithms cleaning out determining rank
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.920]   and authority and all that other stuff.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.920]   So we are coming back around, but we're dealing with millions
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.880]   and billions of people instead of that team of editors
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.320]   meeting and open directory.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.920]   What was called open directory?
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.080]   Yeah, open directory.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.520]   Oh, right.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.080]   D-Mos.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:18.720]   D-Mos.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.280]   That's the most--
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   D-Mos.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.560]   We're still around, I think.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.600]   I don't think anyone cares about it.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.920]   No.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.880]   I think it scrapes from Wikipedia now.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   Really?
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.240]   I guess it'll make sense, you know?
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.280]   So let's go-- but this now, OK, going back
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.240]   to Ryan's article in the epicenter blog in Wired magazine,
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.160]   he does make an interesting point, which
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.680]   is this might tie right back into the Nimwors.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.200]   Remember the battle over using real names on Google+.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.280]   Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.280]   Dun, dun, dun.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.920]   Maybe, he says.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.080]   Maybe this explains Google's hard line position
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.200]   in the Nimwors.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.960]   Google's being adamant that users of its new social networking
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.240]   tool, Google+, use their real names.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.000]   And it's zeal to root out fakers and people using pseudonyms.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.480]   Perhaps what they're trying to do is also protect themselves
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.880]   against phony plus ones.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.720]   But still, I still don't think the plus one on a Google+
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.240]   is the same as a plus one if somebody's on your page
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.040]   and plus ones.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:18.840]   Hi, call board.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.760]   Yeah, people are trying to make an equivalence between plus
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.640]   wanting something and clicking on your own ads.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.960]   Right.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.160]   You know, it's not like people using their real names
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.200]   won't click on a plus one button to promote a blog post
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.440]   or a Google+ post that they've written, right?
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.480]   I mean, I've done it.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.480]   Why not?
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.280]   How could you--
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.560]   How could you have the constantly
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.880]   by people with real looking names on Google+?
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.960]   I mean, people leave comments on my posts
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.720]   all the time with links to their stuff.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.000]   I mean, these are clearly not people.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.040]   These are clearly just spammers who set up fake accounts.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.080]   I mean, Google isn't--
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.480]   Yeah, and I hope you're reporting them
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.320]   so that you're at all.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:48.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.640]   The nice thing is it made it very easy to report.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.240]   It's so easy.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.800]   You just-- you know, if you don't like a comment--
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.300]   Right.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.360]   --you just can totally kill it.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.240]   And we're doing that, but requiring real name
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.160]   doesn't guarantee taking pseudonyms or names
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.720]   that don't look like regular American names
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   doesn't ensure that--
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.600]   I don't think there's a connection there.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.120]   Right.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.840]   Didn't you guys already have Bradley Horro
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.520]   or what's on to talk about this stuff?
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.920]   But this was when Google+ launched.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.440]   So--
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.520]   Yeah, you know, the thing is, though,
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.040]   we still call it a field trial.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.840]   And I know we can make all the jokes about Google
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.000]   and beta and all that stuff.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.280]   And it is still a field trial.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.800]   We're still figuring out sort of what it all means to us.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.880]   And they're working on it.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.360]   So it sucks that it's not fixed to everyone's satisfaction
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.800]   already, but they're working on it.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.600]   And that's really hard to hear, because people
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.320]   put a lot of effort into this whole Nimmore thing.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.800]   And it's sort of an engineering problem
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.160]   that we have to get to.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:47.920]   But wait a minute.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.440]   Google sees everything as an engineering problem.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.400]   Yes, that's who we are.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.600]   Yeah, all right.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.680]   Chris, I've totally seen this Nimmore issue
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.240]   as an iterative thing.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.680]   And it's been amazing watching the groundswell of discussion
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.600]   and the effort behind getting Google to change.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.000]   Google's been super responsive about iterating Google+
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.680]   pretty quickly.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.960]   But when you have Schmidt saying things like he said last week,
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.240]   or this past week, like that, if you don't like it,
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.480]   then don't use it.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.800]   It's hard to feel like that's-- it really is.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.840]   And I know that he's not representative of everyone.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.440]   And Bradley and Vic obviously have said that.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.880]   Well, it's worth wondering what Eric said.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.280]   And I know Eric OK.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.560]   I don't speak for Eric, right?
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.360]   But when he said, listen, if you don't like it, don't use it,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:30.880]   right?
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.680]   And I think what he meant to say was then right now,
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.200]   at the end of it, or yet.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:38.000]   Because the real list is to say, if we're not ready for you,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.920]   then we're not going to cater to your needs.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.200]   Don't use it yet.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.280]   And then when we do, please consider coming back.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.080]   I don't think it's unreasonable to say that.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.520]   But Eric can be very direct.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.880]   And you have to realize, when Eric says something,
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.880]   it's not like when I say something,
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.960]   people are willing to listen to the end of my sentences.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.880]   But Eric will say, well, I like this part of the sentence.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.960]   And I'm going to use that.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.120]   Or that's what I heard.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.800]   Oh my gosh, you already said.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.600]   So when he speaks, it's got a much higher sort of--
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.960]   it's higher risk in some ways.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.040]   And people parse it.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.240]   That's why you see a lot of people in his station,
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.440]   in his position, just not giving interviews,
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.120]   not talking, because there's no--
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.680]   in some ways, there's no way to win.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.640]   I never interview CEOs, because you can never
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.720]   get anything good out of them, except I would interview Eric
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.000]   Schmidt in the heartbeat.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   What can I say?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.320]   Because we--
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.480]   and I mean, that's the truth.
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.080]   Most CEOs are so carefully sculpted, crafted, and cagey
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.240]   that they never say anything.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.240]   And that's, in fact, that's why we've loved Eric,
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.040]   for--
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.640]   and we're going to miss him.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.920]   I think Larry is actually fairly good at controlling
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.760]   the message and staying out of trouble.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.720]   Unfortunately.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.200]   For what, reporters?
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.400]   Well, hey, I love the juicy, you know, creepy quote,
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   every once in a while.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.640]   One-- I'm sorry-- four billion plus ones a day.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.920]   In July, the plus one button went to two billion daily views.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.120]   Today, it's on more than a million sites,
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.080]   according to the official Google blog with four billion
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.880]   daily views.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.920]   Now, that means when you go to my page and you see that plus one
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.720]   button, that's the view.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.320]   You don't have to click it.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.080]   That doesn't say how many clicks there are.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.200]   And then this is sharing with your circles on Google Plus.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:19.800]   We saw that.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.280]   That's the drop down on the plus one button.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.800]   And then this is something else new called snippets.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.440]   That's something they've-- you know,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   I think Google Plus has always done a good job with these
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.960]   little snippets.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.200]   They parse the page.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.960]   And publishers could take advantage of this by customizing
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:45.720]   the content that Google Plus pulls in as a snippet.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.600]   I've always loved that.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.320]   You go to IMDB and you link to it.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.520]   You get just a nice little post and stuff like that.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.520]   So if you're a webmaster, I guess I should read this.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.320]   Is it XML?
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.080]   What do we do here?
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   That must be some sort of text.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.760]   Yes, markup.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.280]   It's rich, rich annotations.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.360]   On the air, just together.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.280]   We'll just put it together.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:05.440]   Yes.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.000]   Body item scope item type equals schema.org/article.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.960]   This is the article.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.440]   And then-- so there's a schema.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.560]   So you load in a schemas, as those of you who've used XML,
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.160]   though.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.640]   And that gives you some new things, like item property name.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.440]   Is the article name?
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.440]   I had a property image.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.040]   This is great.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.120]   And then description.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.040]   You put this in every post.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.240]   Boy, somebody should make a WordPress plugin for this.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.560]   And you'll get nicely formatted snippets.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.880]   Yeah, the problem with this as a web publisher
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.400]   and for web publishers is that there are so many thumbs up,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.200]   like plus one dig buttons that you can kind of put on a post.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.880]   And a lot of it, it's really kind of indicative
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.640]   of what tribe you run in, you know what I mean?
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.680]   It's like the stickers you put on your laptop,
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.000]   like what brands do you identify with?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.440]   What XML schema do you support?
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:55.960]   Exactly.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.600]   It's like, oh, I put plus one, but not like, you know,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.520]   if I put plus one or not Facebook like,
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.280]   then I'm a Google person and not a Facebook person.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:03.880]   So it's hard.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.000]   Or you can just add all of them, which
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.320]   just looks kind of messy.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.120]   And I mean, I think it's great.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.600]   I think it's a good way to share signals.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.320]   But I guess it's that problem of also, you know,
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.880]   this is a cool link, you know, on what of the six social networks
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.080]   or my blog do I want to share it on, which, you know,
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   isn't a correct option.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.800]   You got to do Twitter, you got to do Facebook.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.520]   I think now you have to do Google+, a dig.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.000]   You don't have to do it anymore.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Aww.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.480]   Kevin's here, your power will be enough.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:30.960]   I love Kevin.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.480]   Well, first of all, Kevin left.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.360]   Well, that's true, OK.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.560]   I mean, he's still on the board.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.000]   I'm sure he gets money from them.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.120]   But I think Kevin even Kevin went--
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:38.920]   Kevin doesn't have to--
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.760]   Give him Kevin doesn't have to--
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.760]   On his side.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.360]   Yeah, I mean, I won't speak for Kevin.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.880]   But I was just looking at an article on dead websites
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.760]   and dig made the list because they're-- now,
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.720]   this is from Compete.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.960]   So their Compete numbers are way, way down.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.320]   I don't think Compete's very reliable.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.040]   It requires a toolbar, the Alexa toolbar.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.480]   But still, it's not good.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.640]   Twitter, Facebook, and Plus.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.520]   Do you seem to be the three?
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.240]   Twitter, Facebook, Plus.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:02.740]   What else?
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.360]   LinkedIn may be, maybe.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.640]   No.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.760]   Well, maybe for some kind of business article.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.480]   Yeah, not really.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.520]   That's it.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.760]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.160]   Adam?
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.880]   Oh, he froze.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.000]   Yeah, he froze again, sorry.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:19.840]   He was going to say--
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:19.840]   So--
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   There's now a life pass about.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.480]   How was he going to use?
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.680]   Say it's the whole sentence again,
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.240]   because you cut out in the middle.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.840]   OK, this Facebook has-- they've been doing the link snippet
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.240]   stuff forever.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.280]   Is that something that-- is there any markup for that?
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.120]   Gina, I don't know if you know anything about that.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:37.960]   Facebook snippets?
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.800]   I don't.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.400]   I don't.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.640]   You know, that's a good question.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.160]   I mean--
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   I assume that there was scraping the page and then parsing it.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.320]   Yeah, like detecting the images and stuff.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.120]   Yeah, I'm not sure if you can set up snippets.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.640]   I'd be surprised, actually, if you--
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.240]   Here's where I wish they would just support the goddamn
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.800]   micro formats.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.400]   And then you have one standard--
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.760]   Right, for everybody.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.200]   Use XFN and just do it the way.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.280]   And then everybody be a stand.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.640]   But no, everybody's got to have their own thing.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.960]   And you know, I thought--
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.880]   I thought, Chris, I'm going to call you out on this one,
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   that Google was--
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.080]   They were a big micro format supporter when Kevin Marks was--
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:13.880]   that's what he was doing.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.320]   Isn't Chris Messina doing that?
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.760]   Aren't they pushing XFN and things like that?
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.240]   Shouldn't that be what Google+ uses instead of its own
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.480]   crafty schema?
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:31.680]   So honestly, I have no idea how to answer this question.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.760]   Well, I mean, I think it's interesting.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.520]   You know, it's like when we created site maps,
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:43.520]   there were other ways of sharing bulk URLs in page information.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.320]   And we chose our own way then.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   Right.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.680]   And I know we had good reasons for it
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.480]   but it was seven years ago, so I can't remember them.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.200]   And so when I see this happening,
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.640]   I sort of see it as my job just to make it easy
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.160]   to publish these things.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.800]   And I try not to weigh in on, oh, what about microform ads?
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.640]   Or what about this or that?
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.040]   Because it makes me feel like I'm putting some RSS
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:04.960]   versus Atom--
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.000]   In your heart, though.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.480]   Sort of a bite.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.280]   In your heart, yes.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.320]   Yeah, but I also support-- it's worth pointing out--
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.920]   I support multiple open standards.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.800]   Yeah, that's what Ex-Mog said in our chatroom.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.680]   Open standards are great.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.160]   That's why there's so many of them.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.280]   That's why there's so many of them.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.000]   And I don't see it as my job to decide politically which
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.920]   ones the company backs and which product.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.400]   Well, you mentioned a really good one.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:24.920]   I see short, man.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.200]   You mentioned a good one, which is RSS 1, 2, and Atom,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.480]   which are all three open standards.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.240]   And somewhere Dave Wymer is sweating now.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.880]   So it's like, it's one mentioned them both.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.880]   No.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.280]   All it open standard needs is a really, really big product
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:40.840]   behind it.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.080]   So Google+ getting behind a particular standard
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:43.680]   would be huge.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.200]   Facebook getting behind a particular standard would be huge.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   I think that we're still in the space of deciding
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.360]   what the data is.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.000]   And I don't know.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.640]   Maybe Chris, maybe you can disagree.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.240]   I've been working on getting think-ups data
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.480]   model to be able to accommodate data from all
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.200]   these different places--
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.080]   Twitter, Facebook, eventually Google+ hopefully.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.480]   And I think now we're really getting this place where it's
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:03.960]   a link.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.680]   It's an image.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   It's a description.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.800]   And there's a caption.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.280]   And those are the fields.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.000]   And I think we're really getting to that.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.800]   And hopefully, I would love to see both all of the products
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.440]   that publish that kind of data.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.840]   Just use a particular standard.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.840]   Just pick a standard or pick a couple of standards
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.760]   and use them versus coming up with their own markup.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.960]   And I guess the problem with XF and--
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.200]   I think we picked a couple.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.560]   XF and doesn't really give you what you want, which
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:30.000]   is link title description in a nicely formatted way.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.600]   So maybe there must be a micro format that does that.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.920]   But you know they say there's a country song that says,
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.200]   "Tikila makes her clothes fall off."
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.120]   Apparently, Tikila makes Apple employees lose iPhones.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.320]   Did you see this?
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.880]   Another iPhone has been lost at a mission district
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.760]   Tikila Bar, Kava 22.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.320]   According to the scene, a day after the phone was lost
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.440]   at the Tikila lounge-- it also serves
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.400]   lime marinated shrimp ceviche--
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.880]   Apple representatives contacted San Francisco police
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.000]   saying the device was priceless.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.600]   It sounds like a visa commercial.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.160]   And the company was desperate to secure its safe return.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:19.200]   So somewhere there's floating around an iPhone 5.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:19.800]   Apple's tracked.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.200]   Is this thing gizmodo joke?
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.600]   Yeah, there's something in there.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.280]   No, I don't think--
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.120]   I think gizmodo, even though they did get off
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:32.040]   because they were protected by free press laws.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.080]   I think that they would probably think twice before they'd
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.440]   say anything again, right?
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.640]   Apple tracked the phone to a home in San Francisco's
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.920]   Bernal Heights neighborhood.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.240]   San Francisco police and Apple investigators reportedly
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.040]   spoke to a man in his 20s about the device,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.240]   but he said, I don't know, man.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.120]   After a search, they found nothing.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.600]   There's no word if Apple got the phone back.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.720]   Apple did not file a police report.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.040]   I love that story.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.360]   I just-- I'm sorry.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.440]   I just had this before.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.880]   People sometimes ask me here, Google,
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.760]   hey, why aren't you running the latest tip of tree
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.200]   version of Android on your phone?
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:05.760]   I'm like--
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.400]   Because I like to keep it?
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.920]   Are you kidding?
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.480]   I want to like my job.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.200]   But it's like--
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.240]   and it's not like I want to get liquored up.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.680]   It's a cycle a lot, right?
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.160]   And it's like, I've lost things while traveling.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.000]   What phone do you use right now?
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.680]   I've got the Nexus S on T-Mobile.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.800]   So, you know, and it's running standard--
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.320]   I lean--
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.040]   not honeycomb gingerbread.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.600]   Gingerbread.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.800]   2, 3, 4?
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.480]   I'd have to check.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.360]   It's lovely.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.760]   I mean, it's really nice.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.360]   So I--
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.680]   It ain't ice cream sandwich.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.720]   I can tell you that right now.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.960]   Because I don't want people finding me a conference
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.800]   the same.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.720]   Hey, mind if I use your phone?
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.360]   Do you like-- have you played with ice cream sandwich?
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.720]   I wouldn't be able to say.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.000]   Do you like it?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.840]   See, it's like-- I want Schmidt.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.840]   Bring me Schmidt.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.000]   All right.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.520]   It's really bad identity, you know.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   Dan Christa say something embarrassing and revealing.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.160]   I see-- I actually don't want him to,
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.000]   because I--
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.760]   I'm sure that the consumer will find ice cream sandwich
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.440]   to be lovely.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.200]   And tasty-- a tasty confection.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.880]   So I leave Rivera, who hosts our All About Andrate show,
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.320]   and happens to produce this show as well.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.840]   Of course, has to have the latest Android phone.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.800]   It'll be for long.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.160]   She spent some money on this.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:18.680]   How much was this?
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.360]   600 bucks?
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.560]   Yeah, well, speaking of lost phones, I lost my Nexus S.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.160]   So I had to pay full price for a phone anyways.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.840]   And then I've been salivating over the Samsung Galaxy
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.640]   S2 for a long time.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.000]   And I went ahead and just ponied up
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.080]   and bought the unlocked phone.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.440]   So this is the European version that you put the T-Mobile sim
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.040]   in.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.520]   I have to say, this is gorgeous.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.280]   This is a-- oh, the super AMOLED screen.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.320]   Is this one 4.3 inches?
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:48.960]   Oh, it's got a four.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.080]   Yeah, this one's 4.3.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.600]   Oh, there it goes.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.560]   It focuses automatically.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.480]   And then now we were starting to hear
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.240]   the first official versions of the Galaxy 2S.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.600]   T-Mobile will be selling it.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.760]   Sprint will be selling it.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.200]   And AT&T will be selling it.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.520]   Each has their own names.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.360]   The best one is what is it?
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.720]   The Sprint Epic 4G 3D X-ray phone.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.880]   It's the Epic 4G.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.720]   But what's interesting is AT&T is going
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.000]   to stick with this form factor.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.400]   In fact, this looks very much like the Square AT&T version
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.920]   of the phone.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.800]   But Samsung is going to make a slightly different one
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.960]   for Sprint and T-Mobile that will have a 4 and 1/2 inch screen,
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:37.240]   just playing 2 inches thicker, wider, longer, heftier.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.200]   I want the big one.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.640]   I wonder if they're going to start green making pants.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.360]   So they have to pick a pop.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.800]   A skosh more room.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.880]   That's the slogan for this.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.600]   Like cargo pants will come back in style.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.160]   Now you've got some sort of fancy desktop on--
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.640]   what is the screen management?
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.960]   Oh, this is Go Launcher X.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.560]   Go Launcher X.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.400]   Yeah, it's free.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:56.900]   OK.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.400]   My favorite.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:57.840]   It's pretty nice.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.800]   I like that.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.480]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.520]   But I have to say, it drives me nuts.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.360]   So here's the HTC sensation, which
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.080]   is also a T-Mobile ginger root sauce.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.440]   Same size as the--
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.680]   Same size.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.280]   Same pretty.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:09.640]   I like it.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.480]   It's a little more pretty.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.800]   It's got a little more chrome on it.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.760]   But the gosh, diggity dang buttons.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.200]   OK, now this one's got--
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.560]   they're back to the scroller, which is kind of nice.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.960]   And then it's got the menu button here and the back button
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.460]   there.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.640]   So the scroller becomes the home button.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.640]   But that's not what it's going to look like.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.120]   The phones--
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   In the states.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.300]   There's no buttons.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.040]   No buttons at all.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.960]   And then this one, they've reordered the buttons.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.120]   It's home menu back search.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.160]   Where's the search button on this thing?
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.800]   There is none.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.640]   There's no search--
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.580]   dedicated search button.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.320]   See, that one I use all the time, because I press and hold it,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.320]   and I talk to myself.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.880]   Oh, it's the home button.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.440]   You press and hold it?
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.520]   Double click.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.120]   Double click.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.360]   OK.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.940]   It was double clicking and--
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.020]   it's not coming up now.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:53.560]   There it is.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:57.180]   OK, so that didn't work, I think.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.220]   I don't know if this is getting a little too off topic, but--
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.860]   I don't see how it could be any more off topics than I am.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.860]   There are three buttons on the bottom.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.260]   If these buttons across the bottom row--
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.100]   so I've got an atrix here.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.660]   And yeah, and it's got the four across the bottom row.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.420]   From motor wriggle.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:18.260]   I hate these buttons so much.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.240]   And I would kill for something with just one solid or a couple
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.560]   solid hardware buttons.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.520]   I want to go back to the buttons.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.040]   And now they're all going to be soft, right?
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.800]   They're not even going to be like the ones kind of at the bottom
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.480]   of the screen that light up.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.880]   I would prefer that they're soft to the ones there
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.920]   at the bottom of the screen light up,
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.080]   because those buttons are just wasting space.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.160]   That's true.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.280]   So they'll be on this--
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.960]   I think that's what ice cream sandwich does is it'll--
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.320]   it does what the tablets have done.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.620]   Yeah, it does on the tablets.
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.300]   And I actually prefer that quite a bit personal.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.260]   But you're saying you'd like physical buttons even better?
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.860]   Well, if there's going to be-- for things
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.380]   that you want in every across applications,
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.820]   like search isn't a bad button.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.900]   But at the same time, if everything doesn't have search,
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.460]   I don't see the point in having it permanently on the screen
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.460]   and not working.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.900]   Unless it's going to be like it'll be a universal search.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.140]   If there's no apps specific.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.740]   Kind of making me long for an iPhone.
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.260]   That's what it makes me long for.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.960]   And I don't want an iPhone.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.020]   I don't want an iPhone either.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.280]   But I hate to admit it.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   But the problem is that it's inconsistent and crazy.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:29.220]   Now, I thought MG Seagler wrote a very interesting article
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.540]   that was very-- it was flame bait that said, basically,
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.240]   business would be crazy.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.320]   I think I clipped the speakers there.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:43.040]   Crazy to use an Android phone.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.120]   Any thoughts on that one?
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.240]   Did you read that article?
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.560]   I didn't see that one on TechCrunch.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.960]   It was on TechCrunch.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.960]   That was on TechCrunch.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.920]   Let me see if I can find it, because his position
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.640]   was that security, fragmentation.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.080]   You don't know what you're going to get.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.960]   It's too easy to get apps from third parties
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.240]   to uncheck that.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.960]   And that business just can't afford
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:12.560]   to let this Trojan horse of a phone into the enterprise.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.120]   This is just ridiculous.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   It just shows people don't do their research.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.080]   So we have this really cool device policy app
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.280]   that we're trying out now that does amazing things
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.760]   around locking down and having to be, frankly, corporate IT
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.880]   shop control over your phone.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.320]   And this is just not rocket science.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.560]   And really what MG is saying is, OK,
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.280]   you can choose to abdicate your security to a company
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.760]   in Cupertino, where you can do it yourself in your company.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.200]   And it's one of these fundamental questions.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.840]   So you're saying that the controls
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.320]   are there for an enterprise for an IT department
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.520]   to lock the sucker down?
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.560]   That's right.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.080]   Well, a war, you can just say, let Apple do it,
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.240]   because Apple doesn't really have the enterprise controls.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.880]   By the way, Microsoft also has the former--
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.080]   Microsoft's always given you policy.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.200]   I mean, if you really want to talk about--
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.960]   Try to be fair to the enterprise and phone.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.160]   It's really going to be rimmed.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:12.680]   It's blackberry.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.320]   You're going to talk about Android.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.440]   And then you'll talk about iPhone 16 years later.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.880]   And then you'll talk about Windows.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.600]   But you know why iPhone is really in the enterprise?
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.840]   Because more and more enterprises
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.520]   are letting their employees choose.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.360]   And employees choose iPhone.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:32.160]   They also seem to choose Android not for a lot.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.640]   550,000 activations a day, I guess you're right.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.120]   I know.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.280]   I guess you're right.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.720]   If the company's going to pay for a brand new iPhone,
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.640]   you know?
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   I mean, I don't mean--
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.320]   Well, you know.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.880]   But the company doesn't choose the iPhone.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.080]   That's the point, I think.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.840]   The company probably would choose blackberry.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.640]   And that's what they have historically done.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.760]   They've chosen blackberry, because you've
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.040]   got blackberry enterprise server.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.360]   You've got encryption.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.480]   You've got the security, in most cases.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.360]   You've got the policy ability to set policy
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.600]   from the IT department.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:06.560]   All of the things that a corporate buyer wants on blackberry.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.160]   And you're saying, Chris DeBona, that Android will do all of that.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.920]   Well, so if you've looked into how
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.280]   blackberry's enterprise server stuff works,
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.880]   it's incredibly detailed.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.200]   And it's very, very powerful.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:19.700]   Right?
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.360]   And unless you're France or Iraq, you don't have to worry.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.080]   Users kind of don't want the phones.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   Right.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:25.680]   Right.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.720]   So Android is sort of this happy medium, really,
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.680]   between phones that people will like and want to have.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   And something that can be moderately well-managed
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.960]   by the enterprise.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.360]   Right?
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.320]   So, you know, sure.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.840]   People love their iPhones, absolutely.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.440]   But you can't manage them, right?
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.160]   But you can manage the hell of a blackberry
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.600]   that people don't want them.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.480]   So what are you going to do?
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.720]   So it seems like it's a good middle ground.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:51.680]   Do-to-to.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.520]   I think it is.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.360]   And I personally actually really dislike using iPhones.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.880]   But, you know, I'm obviously working for Google.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.800]   And we use a lot of Google services.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.680]   And just going from that back to an iPhone, you know,
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.240]   because we have an iPad at the house,
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.120]   and it's the same stuff.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:10.840]   It's like, I just feel like it's totally nerfed, you know?
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.560]   I just don't have time for that anymore.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.800]   I have too many things I need to get done.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.280]   So.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.960]   I like the flexibility on Android.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.200]   That's really, for me, what it all comes down to.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.240]   But it's that exact flexibility that MG is saying
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.680]   is a security risk.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.480]   But you're saying-- I'll give you an example.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.280]   So you're saying the policy editor or whatever-- what
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.240]   is the tool that Android offers?
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.240]   It's device policy.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.680]   I think it's on the market.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.320]   OK.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.240]   But without the back end stuff running,
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.000]   it's no good for you.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.840]   But yeah, the device policy stuff, for instance, on my phone
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:43.400]   says you have to run X version of the operating system on X
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.840]   phones.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:48.120]   You can't install things from an unsorseless
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.400]   if that's been ticked for your user account, things like that.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.480]   So that's key.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.760]   I mean, that's one that--
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.160]   that's one that MG pointed to specifically, the fact
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.840]   that third party apps are allowed, which is, I think,
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.040]   is a little specious because that presumes that the app
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.480]   marketplace that Apple offers is absolutely secure and safe.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.720]   And it's clear that there are so many apps being released
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.640]   that there's no way Apple can really, truly vet all those apps
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.720]   to make sure they are secure.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   And in fact, some malicious apps have leaked into the iTunes
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.200]   app store.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.520]   Not as many as on Android.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.800]   We've seen quite a few more on Android.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.280]   I don't know that I think the measure of both stores
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.200]   is how fast they act when they find a bad actor.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.200]   Right.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.000]   So some people in chat are saying that it's
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.800]   Paul Therat, who wrote that article.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.480]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:32.920]   You're right.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.960]   It wasn't MG Seagler.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.200]   I take it back.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.920]   It was Paul-- our very own Paul Therat.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.920]   Paul, thank you.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.960]   Yeah, Windows Weekly Guy.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:39.720]   I'm so sorry.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.840]   You're absolutely right.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.960]   It's just the kind of article MG would have written that.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.800]   Hey, it's for iPhone.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.320]   It's got to be MG.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.440]   No, MG did not say that Paul Therat did.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.560]   And he's-- and it really got a lot of attention
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.760]   where he said, you'd be crazy, crazy.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.480]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.560]   Paul deserves credit for that, or discredit,
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.840]   depending on your point of view for that article.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.280]   He's promoting Windows Phone obviously
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.320]   as a safer alternative.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.080]   No one wants to win.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.840]   I'm not sure that that's what you're saying.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.760]   Come on.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.720]   I mean, I--
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:14.800]   Maybe that'll change.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.560]   That might change.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.160]   That might change, because that pretty system
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.120]   is actually pretty cool.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.160]   So it's a good operating system, yeah.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.760]   So I know someone who recently lost her work phone
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.960]   and had the choice to buy a new work phone, right?
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.120]   So iPhone was a choice.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.480]   And then Android 2, 2, and up, right?
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.680]   The IT department supported Android 2, 2, and up.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.820]   And part of the problem was like, how do I know which phones
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.880]   run which version of Android?
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.440]   And if this one ships with the lower version,
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.240]   can I upgrade it?
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.240]   And there was a lot of questions and confusion about that.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.200]   And so the iPhone seemed like--
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.680]   the iPhone is just such a strong brand, I think.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.280]   And so that's why I said, hey, if the company's
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.360]   going to pay for an iPhone, I could see people buying it
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.880]   or going with it, just because it's such a strong brand.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.480]   And if the company's paying for it, why not?
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.680]   But that said, you definitely want
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.160]   an Android device over a Blackberry or Windows phone.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:46:59.860]   Paul says--
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:00.640]   I need an iPhone.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.200]   Paul says Android thinking of IT, just
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:08.340]   of IT, Android is his disaster waiting to happen.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.460]   That's crazy.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.060]   That's a little suspicious.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.820]   I don't do corporate IT, and I don't work for Google,
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.580]   but that seems a little--
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.820]   I think the rebuttal is--
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.300]   I work in corporate IT.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.180]   There's two kinds of phones they hate.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.180]   One's they can't even control.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.020]   And one's that are so complicated they can't maintain.
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.220]   They can't figure the hand.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.100]   And that's part of his point, is that the fragmentation of UI
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.100]   and OS is--
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.860]   But that can be restricted, so it's not a big problem.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.360]   Yeah, if you just say you have to use this version,
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.360]   you can't turn on third party apps.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.160]   You can only use certain apps.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.880]   You can only do-- I think as long as--
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.080]   I haven't analyzed the security policy.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.020]   But as long as this security policy gives you
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.920]   all those features, then I think that you're right.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.480]   I think that that this--
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.280]   do we know what the enterprise uptake is on Android devices?
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.120]   I have no idea.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:58.620]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.340]   I suppose if I were RAM, I'd be more worried than anybody
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.080]   about the whole thing.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.240]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.000]   We are talking.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.120]   We have a great cast here.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.380]   And Adam, I want to get you in more,
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.200]   but I have a feeling we're having trouble with the Skype.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.560]   Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.280]   I'm not sure what's going on.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.160]   Don't worry about it.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.120]   But you know what you should do is just write an article
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.120]   on Life Hacker about how to get Skype working better.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.040]   We had a joke because we did one today.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.000]   I know you did.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.400]   I don't--
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.480]   Gee, wouldn't that be a great article?
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.120]   It's always work fine.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.960]   It's working poorly now.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.480]   It's us.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.240]   It's probably visiting Life Hacker right now.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.800]   It's totally us.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.280]   Let me just tell you, we screw up more Skype than anybody else.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.120]   Life Hacker's a great site.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:50.120]   Adam is the editor-in-chief of the site that Gina started,
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.840]   but he's just got great stuff in it.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.840]   Great stuff in it.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.080]   Lifehacker.com.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.360]   Thank you for being here, Adam.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:01.160]   Kristobona, is it Open Programs Manager?
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.000]   It's Open Source and Public Sector Programs Manager.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.720]   Open Source and Public Sector Program Manager for the Goog.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.560]   It doesn't matter.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.440]   If there's something Open Source at Google,
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.080]   I'm kind of the guy who deals with it.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.040]   Yeah, and you're good at it.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.160]   I'd like to think so.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.880]   He's a great guy, and he's straightforward.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.920]   If I can't get Eric Schmidt on the show,
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.160]   you're the next best.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.360]   I don't know.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.640]   I really think that having Bradley on again
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.160]   might be a better video.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.360]   I love Bradley, and I love it.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.760]   Oh, you should have on Natalie Villalobos.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.760]   She's sort of the community manager for Plus.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.760]   I'd love to.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.760]   Great.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:42.240]   And I saw that you just hired Lewis, which is Lewis Gray for Plus.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.080]   I think that's great.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.240]   I love Lewis, and that's great, too.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.640]   I only kind of know him a little bit through online stuff.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.520]   So really great guy.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.960]   Yeah, I've never met him.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.600]   I don't think.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.360]   But isn't that funny how you start to feel like if you really
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.400]   interact with these people in social media, you're like, I know you.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.640]   I've known you for years.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.120]   Lewis, I know about his kids.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.120]   When his kids were born.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.120]   I've seen the baby pictures.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.280]   I mean, how much more can you know somebody?
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.920]   He shares a lot.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.640]   He shares a lot.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.440]   Gina Trepene is also here from SmarterWare.org.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.680]   Great conversation today.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.120]   It is always fun when we have these great people on.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.920]   But briefly, I want to mention Netflix.com.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.920]   Dirty dancing.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:30.200]   I couldn't believe they're remaking a footloose.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.760]   They're going to remake dirty dancing.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.200]   And they're remaking dirty dancing.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.000]   And they're remaking--
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:34.500]   Why?
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.000]   Yeah, why?
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   Why?
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.760]   They're remaking wargames.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.800]   They're remaking a ton of movies.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.400]   It's like the--
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   But they remade "Fright Night."
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.600]   I kind of want to see that.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.240]   I got to tell you.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.280]   That's actually quite some good reviews.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:44.800]   All right.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.120]   So my suggestion, however, is to go to Netflix.com
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.720]   and watch the originals before you burn your eyes
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.840]   with these bad remakes.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.200]   Because it'll spoil it forever.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.400]   If you haven't seen dirty dancing,
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.200]   it'll spoil it forever if you see the remake.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.760]   If you haven't seen "Footloose," you
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.920]   want to see the original.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.600]   You want to see the movie that's started at all.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.320]   There's some great things here, too.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.240]   They're doing the Millennium Saga,
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.720]   the girl who played with fire.
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.760]   And the Hollywood versions will be up.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.240]   But they've got the original Scandinavian versions on here.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:16.920]   They're dark.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.040]   I got to warn you, they're really dark.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.120]   But they're also really true to the novels
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.080]   and just great, the novels are dark.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.640]   Great TV shows.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.560]   Kids of stuff, too.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.720]   Look, Toy Story 3, the Princess and the Frog.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.360]   I mean, if you've got an iPad and you've
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.320]   got Netflix streaming, you don't have to ever talk to your kid
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.320]   again.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.720]   It's just incredible.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.000]   Do you play this on your Mac, your PC, your iPad,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:39.520]   your iPhone?
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.800]   24 different Android devices now.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   Thank God.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.280]   On the tablets as well.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.440]   And of course, most TVs, all the Blu-ray players, Xbox 360,
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.880]   PS3, Nintendo Wii, they all can play that Netflix.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.760]   I use Roku.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.680]   That's my personal favorite Roku box.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.920]   Google TV does it.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.420]   Yes.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.800]   Pretty much anything to connect to your TV is going to do it.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.040]   So here's the deal.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.480]   I know you're already a Netflix member.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.040]   I know I'm preaching to the choir.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   If, for some reason, you've missed out,
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.920]   try the streaming $7.99 a month.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.680]   Forget the disk.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.560]   Just go with the streaming.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.840]   $7.99 Netflix is going to be mad at me.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.200]   But I just love the streaming because emotional drama
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.000]   is about marriage.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.600]   I love just the recommendations they give me.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.000]   What's the deal with that?
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.840]   The burning bed and the line and winner?
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.560]   You've been watching some emotional dramas
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:29.160]   about marriage.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.000]   Is that what happened?
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.400]   I think that's what happens in there.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.160]   Well, look, recently watched the family guy.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.880]   Oh, that is an emotional drama about marriage.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:39.760]   Of course, no wonder they came up with the burning bed.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.520]   Dark movies based on a book.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:41.720]   Yes.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.880]   So these recommendations come from what you've been watching,
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.520]   I guess.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.680]   I don't know.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.840]   Mind-bending cult movies.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.440]   Anyway, the recommendations are great,
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.920]   but there's tens of thousands of movies and TV shows.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.720]   And if you're not a member, go to Netflix.com/twit.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.120]   And you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.000]   And if you already are, do me a favor.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.160]   Just go throw up and go to your window.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:11.120]   Throw up in your window and shout Netflix.com/twit.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.800]   Just get somebody to do it for us.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   Netflix.com/twit-- make me happy.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   Goofy workplace TV shows.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.000]   They must know I work at Twit.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.160]   That's not from what I've watched.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.800]   That's they know where I work.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.960]   They've gotten so specific with their categories.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.720]   Isn't it hysterical?
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.000]   It's so funny.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.600]   quirky TV comedies featuring a strong female lead.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.120]   Classic--
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.760]   These are these weird dogs of switch places with humor.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.280]   Exactly.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.760]   Left-handed Portuguese comedy.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.640]   Inspiring fight the system documentaries.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.400]   I love this.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.040]   I love this.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.240]   And the truth is I often don't go beyond the recommendations
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.760]   because it usually is good stuff.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.800]   It usually is good stuff.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.160]   Apparently, I've been watching a lot of movies about gay love.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.000]   So--
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:02.640]   Nice.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.600]   Wow.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.240]   Gay dad.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.320]   Shut up and kiss me.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.720]   That's a good one.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.720]   In this charming relationship--
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.600]   Hardly to get our eyes to red.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.520]   Good job, Leo.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.680]   Somebody said-- I think it was Eileen--
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.160]   He said, you're pretty brave showing
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.840]   your Netflix recommendations.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.120]   That was really--
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.200]   That's what mine looked like.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.240]   Was that you, Gina?
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.280]   Yeah, I don't mind.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.320]   I don't mind.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.440]   You can know what I watch.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.280]   Mine is filled with gay love.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.640]   Gay love movies.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.600]   Yes.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.920]   You know, I watched when I just loved so much,
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.080]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.840]   And I think that's probably why-- well, not zero filia.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.680]   I didn't watch that.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   But it was so good.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:43.160]   But anyway, some of these are getting a little--
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.080]   Wow.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:45.840]   Man.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.320]   OK.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.360]   You start shirtless men?
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   Nice.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.360]   Let's go back to Batman.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.920]   Anyway, wait a minute.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   Robin, Batman?
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.480]   OK, maybe that's why they got this whole thing going here.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.640]   I don't know.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.200]   Netflix.com/twit, please enjoy.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.680]   Netflix knows what you want.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.080]   I don't know how they know.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:11.160]   Moving along, there must be more in the twig rundown.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.440]   Leo, you were saying just last week after we finished a show,
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.240]   Steve Jobs' resignation announcement came out.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.480]   That was after this show?
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   Yeah, it was right after it.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.720]   Oh, we should talk about it.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.280]   I feel bad because we've talked about it on every show.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.800]   This is the last show to get it.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.200]   But what are your thoughts?
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.960]   Well, you know, I thought it was interesting what
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.800]   you were saying earlier about how you get to know people
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.880]   online and social media.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.680]   Like, you feel like you know them, even though you haven't met them.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.400]   And after Steve Jobs' resignation announcement,
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:40.040]   Vic Condotra, whose birth name is Vivec, just an aside,
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:43.680]   he posted on Google+, this story about working with Steve.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.280]   Did you see this?
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.600]   The icon ambulance story?
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.280]   It's so good.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:49.360]   In fact, I'm going to read it out loud in a dramatic reading.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:49.840]   OK.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.280]   Because it really is a great story.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.040]   And you're exactly right, Gina.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.320]   This might have been of all of the hagiography
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.080]   and the eulogizing that we did and everybody
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.000]   did about Steve Jobs.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.480]   This was the one that said more about who Steve was than anything.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:05.840]   Definitely.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.400]   And would we have heard this from Vic if Google+ didn't exist?
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.280]   It's a perfect place for him to share it.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.120]   Right, exactly.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.120]   It was a perfect place.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.680]   Those kind of humanized folks who maybe wouldn't have a place.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.200]   So go ahead.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:17.400]   Right.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.560]   He could have written in a blog post.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.160]   But I don't know if we would have seen it.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.440]   But this way we all saw it.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.840]   One Sunday morning, I was attending religious services
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.840]   when my cell phone vibrated.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.680]   As discreetly as possible, I checked the phone.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:31.200]   Notice my phone said, call or ID I know and I chose to ignore.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.640]   Later, I checked my messages.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.400]   The message was from Steve Jobs.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.960]   It said, Vic, can you call me at home?
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:40.000]   I have something urgent to discuss before I even reached my car.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.240]   I called Steve Jobs back.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.280]   This was when Vic was responsible for mobile applications
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.080]   at Google.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.480]   He said, in that role, I had regular dealings with Steve.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.160]   It was one of the perks of the job.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.280]   Hey, Steve, this is Vic.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.880]   I said, I'm sorry I didn't answer your call earlier.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.280]   I was in religious services.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:53.880]   Steve laughed.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.800]   He said, Vic, unless the caller ID said, God,
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.240]   you should never pick up during services.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.200]   I laughed nervously.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.840]   After all, it was customary for Steve
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.120]   to call during the week upset about something.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.240]   But it was unusual for him to call me on Sunday
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.440]   and ask me to call his home.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.520]   I wondered what was so important.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.040]   So Vic says, Steve, we have an urgent issue.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.640]   One that I need addressed right away.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.840]   I've already assigned someone for my team to help you.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.320]   And I hope you can fix this tomorrow.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.120]   I've been looking at the Google logo on the iPhone
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.440]   and I'm not happy with the icon.
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:30.200]   The second O in Google doesn't have the right yellow gradient.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.280]   It's just wrong.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.680]   And I'm going to have Greg fix it tomorrow.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.120]   Is that OK with you?
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.880]   Of course, this was OK with me.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:40.080]   He gets an email from Steve with the subject icon ambulance.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:43.960]   So there's a sense of humor coming through from Steve
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.760]   that you don't normally get, frankly,
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.480]   and a lot of anecdotes about Steve Jobs.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.880]   The email directed me to work to fix the icon.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.080]   I think it's just great.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.600]   He says, in the end, when I think about leadership, passion,
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   and attention to detail, I think back to the call
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.040]   I received from Steve Jobs on a Sunday morning in January.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.960]   It was a lesson I'll never forget.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:08.680]   CEOs should care about details, even shades of yellow
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.120]   on a Sunday to one of the greatest leaders I've ever met.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.040]   My prayers and hopes are with you, Steve.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.280]   Isn't that great?
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.560]   You're absolutely right, Gina.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.160]   Best story.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.040]   Best story out of everything you got.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.920]   And everybody said, it said at all his attention
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:24.640]   to detail, his kind of obsessive attention to detail.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:28.760]   And yet the sense of humor and playfulness, it was great.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:29.560]   Really great.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.840]   Yep.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.200]   New feature in Google plus speaking
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.480]   of which you can now ignore people.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.360]   Yeah, this is kind of a weird feature.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:42.400]   Like, so it sounds like you can ignore people who you've circled.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.520]   You can ignore people who have circled you.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.800]   So that incoming stream, if someone has circled you
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.720]   and you see them in your incoming stream,
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.240]   if it's somebody who you've just decided,
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.800]   I'm not going to circle this person back, you can ignore them.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.960]   And they won't show up in your people who have circled you
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.280]   list or your incoming stream.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.360]   So it's actually-- it's not like following someone
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.920]   then muting them.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.960]   It's basically saying, don't show me this person again.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.200]   I'm definitely not going to circle them,
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.240]   so get them out of my--
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.680]   So you've had Block, which is kind of more draconian.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.440]   I mean, that just kills this person.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.760]   Yeah, Block is like, don't ever show me this person ever.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.120]   Right.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.360]   So ignore does what?
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:16.440]   It makes them not show up in comments, too.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.240]   Well, actually, no.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.200]   You'll see their plus ones.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.120]   You'll see their comments.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:21.080]   You won't see them in the incoming stream
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.480]   or in the list of people who have circled you.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.760]   So that's one of the cool things about Google Plus.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.840]   It kind of shows you people who have circled you
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.960]   that maybe these are people that you might want to circle
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.320]   in a kind of way.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.680]   So you can say, I'm not going to circle this person.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.160]   I don't want to see this person in my incoming list.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.120]   Just show me other people who have circled me.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:38.920]   So it's kind of a--
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.840]   This is an example.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:41.760]   So Chris Brogan-- actually, who I followed for a long time,
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.880]   but there was so much content I actually uncircled him,
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.080]   which is not the same as blocking.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.360]   I still see comments and pluses and stuff.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:51.640]   But now I could say ignore him.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.440]   And then I won't see his--
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.880]   And then you won't see him incoming.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.120]   And then you won't see him in your list of people who circled.
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.800]   So it's kind of a weird but subtle way of saying here,
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.960]   you can constantly browse the new people who have circled you.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.040]   And if you just don't want to see somebody ever again,
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:06.880]   you can see--
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.680]   And I actually think this is much needed.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.600]   Because while I often check incoming to look at who I'm
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.120]   not following that I should be, some of these people
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.440]   are posting kind of stuff I don't want to see at all.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.640]   It burns my eyes.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.160]   So those people I can say, don't put them in there anymore.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:21.680]   Right.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.280]   So instead of blocking them, it just kind of harsh.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.680]   Ignore just says, hey, get them out of me incoming.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.280]   I don't want to see this.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.520]   But it's specifically for incoming,
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.200]   not for the rest of the--
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:29.640]   Right.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.040]   But you'll see their comments on your--
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.680]   If you don't want to see people's comments or pluses,
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.360]   then block them.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.760]   But if you just don't want to see them incoming,
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.560]   then you can ignore them.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.320]   So it's a less harsh block.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:37.840]   We do.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.200]   We need an animated GIF filter.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.760]   I love the animation.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.400]   This is something that involved kittens.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.520]   Well, this is something that is kind of controversial
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:53.120]   in Google+ because it's something that MySpace had.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.440]   Facebook does not.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.800]   Twitter does not.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.000]   And I was clearly--
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.480]   Chris Tibonik, and you shed a lot of it on this,
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:05.240]   was their internal debate over the animated GIF.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.800]   So if you look at--
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   I think it was Buzz or one of the other services
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.640]   where you could post pictures.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.080]   The first thing that me and a couple other people do
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.840]   are put up a couple of animated GIFs to see if they work.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.240]   And figure out what the parameters are
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.400]   and which we can share animated GIFs.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.320]   We just don't use them enough internally
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.880]   for them to be too annoying during dog fooding.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.680]   So I think that when it--
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.440]   You didn't count on Jenny and Joe Day.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.120]   This is awesome.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.120]   No.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.960]   I think it would be just for too much fun to not support.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.040]   No, I agree.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.920]   Is that one of the people going, oh no.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.400]   You know, walking back and forth like this.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.960]   Oh no, oh no, it's like that.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.320]   I haven't seen that one yet.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.480]   I mustn't be following.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.480]   I probably do unfollow people who use it too often.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.160]   Yeah, I mean, it's all about moderation.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.840]   A lot of celebrity starting to appear now on Google+.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.120]   My celeb circle is getting quite full.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.440]   There's Avril Lavigne, Snoop Dogg.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.480]   We've got Britney Spears, very active,
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.120]   on their Sammy Hagar, like him.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:07.960]   You can tell who--
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.000]   You can't drive 55.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.560]   Yeah, you can't drive 55.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.120]   Madonna is in there.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.080]   We'll wait, and I don't know.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.680]   Does he count?
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.560]   He counts.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560]   He counts.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.120]   There's a kitten picture on a skateboard.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.440]   What could possibly be real wrong?
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.240]   Sometimes they do it now with animated GIFs.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.840]   They're doing them so subtle that you don't know
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.560]   that it's an animated GIF, and then it's something weird happens.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.040]   Like the reigning one with Dr. Who.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:41.320]   Yeah, so I want a not colon.gif search filter for my Google+
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.480]   Any search at all would be nice.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.400]   Any search at all.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.760]   So Chris, maybe you can confirm or deny this.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.600]   The theory-- I was talking over a theory with a friend of mine
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.200]   from the works at Qualcomm, who's saying
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.440]   that the reason why Google+ doesn't have search right now
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.600]   is because of the privacy--
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.880]   because the visibility issue, that doing late binding
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.800]   of visibility showing public posts as well as posts
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.760]   that you've permissioned to see is just too resource intensive
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.440]   or too difficult.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.920]   Is that anywhere in the ballpark, Chris?
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:11.800]   Probably not.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.040]   Yeah, that sounds fishy to you.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.800]   Even though it is kind of fishy that there's no post search.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.640]   This is a good example of how--
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.600]   Well, I think we need to find a search company to help.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.760]   No.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.600]   It's just a good example of how in a vacuum, weird-ass rumors
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.360]   just appear.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.160]   It's true.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.000]   No, it's so true.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.360]   I've heard some great ones.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   In fact, let's make one up.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:38.680]   No, the reason it's not done was because we had a deal with Coca-Cola
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.720]   to do search research.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.160]   No, I--
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.520]   You're waiting for the brand search to get going.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.560]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.720]   Brand brands, yes, business.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.640]   There is-- Dr. Exis saying in the chat,
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.960]   there's no search on Facebook.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.760]   I didn't even think about that, but you can't just--
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.760]   Really?
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.400]   I don't-- you can search for people and I think just people.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.040]   Isn't a search engine?
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.000]   Well, that's true.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.480]   That's a good point.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.800]   Do you know of a good search engine?
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.280]   I'll tell you what I find interesting is--
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:05.800]   That's true.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.360]   I haven't watched a lot of network television,
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.720]   but I watched the VMA Awards and I just saw the season ending
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.000]   Glee.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.400]   And shows now are giving suggested hashtags like all the time.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.160]   Like Glee, it says pound Glee in there.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.480]   Yes, the watermark, right?
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.920]   On the bottom corner.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.160]   And that just shows you how-- and I've always
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.520]   said that hashtags are just specialized version of search.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.840]   They're saying this is some metadata
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.960]   that will tell you that this post has to do with Glee.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.360]   And you can click it on Twitter anyway.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.280]   You can click it and do a Glee search.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.400]   So to me, it's a specialized version of search.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.040]   And that's how important it is that shows are actually now
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.560]   saying, well, there's a canonical search used pound Glee.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:45.880]   Right.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.720]   Like, here's the keyword.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.760]   It's like a well keyword.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.280]   It's a new--
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.800]   It is the a well keyword.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.520]   Exactly what it is.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.800]   I think people do find comfort in keywords.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.480]   I know that sounds strange, but they've
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.360]   been saying, type go Glee in AOL for 20 years.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.160]   It's all the same people, too.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.080]   And yeah, so it's kind of interesting.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.360]   Go to this Yahoo sub page or something.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.000]   That's a good point.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.600]   I didn't even--
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.920]   Glee used to it.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.400]   I didn't really think of it.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.120]   And everyone's probably-- yeah, it's for Amazon Flows.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.520]   They'll go and use Twitter or some link on Google
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.960]   or Yahoo or whatever.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.640]   And then they'll fade back over.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:25.600]   You should go to SonyMovies.com/Daredevil/2/The Awakening.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.920]   Well, one thing I did notice is that the hashtags are always
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.080]   I mean, pound Glee.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.480]   So they're always obvious.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.600]   Pound true blood.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.360]   Like what else would you do?
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.440]   Those are the obvious ones.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.480]   I guess if they had a non-obvious one, pound
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.560]   truebies, then OK.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.200]   Yeah, but then that sounds like some weak marketing effort.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:42.920]   No, that's what they're called.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.440]   We're all calling ourselves truebies now.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.520]   No, Chris, that's what they're called.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.240]   Oh, God, really?
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:48.680]   Isn't it?
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.240]   You can't make it.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.000]   Am I right?
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.520]   Eileen hosts a show called Love at First Bite.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.280]   No, what is the name of your show?
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.240]   It's called Bite Club.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.400]   Bite Club.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.080]   So she's an expert.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:58.600]   I want--
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.480]   They're called truebies.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.400]   They're called truebies.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.320]   I'm not making this up.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.200]   I couldn't make it up.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.280]   Oh, you couldn't.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:04.680]   You couldn't.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.400]   Hey, I'm excited about--
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.960]   Sam's-- this is this--
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.400]   this sounds like I'm making it up.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.400]   I am excited about Samsung's chat on Messenger.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.400]   What's that?
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.600]   It's just nothing.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.920]   So Samsung announced that they're
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.760]   going to do to compete with Facebook Messenger and Apple's
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.640]   iMessage, and everybody's doing a Messenger.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.480]   And of course, there's about 20 group messaging applications
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.040]   that are across platform.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.560]   But the reason I thought the Samsung chat on was interesting
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.360]   is it's going to be completely cross-platform--
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:41.400]   Windows Mobile, BlackBerry, Apple, Android, and PCs, desktops.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.440]   And I have yet to find a Messenger, except Facebook's
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.680]   Messenger, which I refuse to use, that I can interact on the phone
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.280]   and then get to my desktop and interact there.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.360]   I just think that's really cool.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.560]   Plus, it's going to have animated GIFs.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.880]   Don't forget, bada.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.380]   Bada?
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:56.880]   Bada?
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.880]   It's a bada.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880]   What's bada?
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.220]   It's bada.
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.560]   What is bada?
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.560]   Is that how you pronounce it?
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560]   I don't even know.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.060]   Bada.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.720]   Bada, bada being.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   Samsung has another operating system
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.040]   that they use called bada.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.960]   And it's on bada as well.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.120]   It would have to be on bada.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:11.880]   It is on bada.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.240]   It has to be on bada for me to use it.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.200]   Use bada?
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.200]   It's on bada.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.760]   No, I never heard of it until I saw this article.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.080]   No one uses bada.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.080]   Bada.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.200]   I was just--
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:22.800]   I was just--
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.240]   I think it's pronounced bada.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:25.960]   It's straight bada.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.960]   It's bada.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.880]   Like bada.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   Bada.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.400]   Samsung's been very, very nice to us.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.000]   I like the Samsung phones.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.480]   I would never really consider using a wireless company's
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.760]   software in any way.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.400]   It's almost always the first thing you remove from your phone.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.560]   Seriously.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.360]   I mean, really?
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.920]   Isn't that the first thing you get off is the Motorola 18?
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.280]   Android saves us from that.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.320]   I know.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.320]   Seriously.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.560]   You know what saves me from that?
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.560]   Cyanogen mod.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.560]   Animation.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.560]   Messages.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.560]   Look at see that.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.560]   You can do that.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.560]   And then-- oh.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.560]   Wouldn't you like a messenger that does that?
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.560]   Oh.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.560]   Oh.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:06.640]   Do you remember the beginning of Starship Troopers where the
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.120]   Casa Revan Dean character sends an animation to the girly like?
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120]   No.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.560]   That's what they're trying to do.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.440]   We're trying to bring the--
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.600]   Hace in the future.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.200]   Hace in the fascist future of Starship Troopers.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.200]   Wow.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.200]   They send you--
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   Would you like to know more?
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.200]   No.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.200]   I'm going to do that.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.200]   All right.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.200]   We can stop showing this stupid video.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.200]   Thank you.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.200]   Someone in the chat room says, "Is the Microsoft Search app called Bada Bing?"
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.200]   Bada Bing.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.200]   That's a lot of time.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.200]   Tablets.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.880]   It's a touch pad, of course, now.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:43.000]   There's a great article, by the way, on the Wall Street Journal in which it says, "If
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.920]   you were going to kill a company-- if you were given one year to kill a company, what
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920]   would you do?"
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.800]   And it's everything that HP has done over the last year.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.800]   I mean, everything.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.320]   HP's one year plan.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.760]   This is a blog post by Al Lewis.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.800]   Let's see, "You were given a year to kill who you have packred."
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:08.240]   First, fire well-performing CEO Mark Hurd over expense reporter regularities in a juicy
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:13.520]   sex harassment claim that you admit has no merit and no sex.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.360]   Fire for board members as publicly as possible.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:22.640]   Fomata Massics Exodus of key executives then hire a new CEO from German competitor SAP
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:28.320]   which sells business software, not consumer products, not hardware, and tell him the Mr.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.320]   Hurd left HP in great shape.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:36.000]   Pursue pricey mergers and stock buybacks allow expenses to run out of control.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.480]   Try to blow through billions of dollars in cash reserves before the next global economic
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.400]   slowdown.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.600]   And then finally, boast that you're going to attack Apple's iPad with your $499 touchpad,
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.640]   then dump your touchpad in a $99 fire sale, then announce you're not going to offer it
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.520]   anymore, then-- and I have to add to this article-- announce, well, maybe we'll make
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.640]   a few more.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.080]   They've announced they're going to make some more.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:07.840]   And by a British company that does the same thing that SAP does for $10 billion.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.240]   Unbelievable.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.080]   So this is the question actually I'd like to ask you.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:21.600]   Does the success of the $99 touchpad, Adam Pash, say that the touchpad wasn't a failure
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.600]   technically.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.320]   It was a pricing failure.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.960]   No, I mean, it didn't have to be the touchpad.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.000]   It could be any tablet that sold for $99 and people would have bought it.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   So there is a price.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   I mean, if you can go that low.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.920]   I'm just saying the price doesn't have anything to do with the touchpad.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.040]   It just has to do with tablet prices.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:43.640]   If anyone could go that low, I think that they would be looking at a pretty good situation
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.640]   in terms of getting-- like they're an Android tablet, they're $99.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.200]   I think people would be pretty happy to buy that.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.200]   Well, it's interesting because they're very--
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.200]   --much more so--
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.200]   --for touchpad.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.200]   They're very first thing a lot of people are trying to do is put Android on the touchpad.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.200]   Web--
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:01.400]   Yeah, there's a-- there's a cyanogen for touchpad that they said this week that they announced
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.840]   that they've got sort of working on and running.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.840]   That's tempting.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:11.920]   Very positive review by Sasha Segan and PC Magazine online of the new Sony tablet S.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.680]   Have you seen a prototype of this, Chris?
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.680]   Floating around?
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.680]   Uh--
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.680]   --again talk.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.480]   --you know which one-- if we're going to talk about a cool tablet, I really want to talk
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.200]   about this one, I guess, as shipping in Japan, the Fujitsu one.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.200]   I haven't seen it.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.200]   The ruggedized one.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.480]   That's the one I want to talk about, because that's the one I want.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.960]   I want a tablet I can spill crap on.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.200]   Yeah, I have to admit, looking at this Sony thing, I can't get excited about it.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.720]   I haven't been excited about Sony hardware in an awful long time.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.320]   It looks thick.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.840]   It doesn't look quite right.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.040]   So this is a Fujitsu Android tablet that's only in Japan.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.040]   Right now.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040]   And I'm hoping they come to the United States.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]   It's also got 4G.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.040]   Does it bounce if you drop it?
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.040]   Do you?
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.960]   If it's anything like their rugged laptops, I'm sure it's amazing.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:55.960]   Hm.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:56.960]   So--
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.160]   It's ruggedized-- it's the only ruggedized Android tablet on the street.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:04.720]   It's the arrows tab, waterproof mill spec.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.080]   I wonder if that's rubber.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.440]   You mean sort of the second color of the black.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.440]   The bezel.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.440]   You think it would bounce?
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.440]   I'm not literally--
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.800]   I do like the idea of being able to just not worry about it.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.800]   I want to take it in the box.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.800]   You mean--
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.000]   It's the shower tablet.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.200]   Seriously, you can keep reading and doing your email.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.200]   That's it.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.360]   I want to mount it on the tile inside my shower, play a Twitch show.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.800]   Where's the market for that?
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.640]   That's a great idea.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.760]   It's brilliant.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.960]   I know a lot of people have mounted iPads in the dashboard of their car.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.280]   But yeah, a shower tablet.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.080]   What a great idea.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.640]   You could put Samsung's chat on Messenger on it.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.600]   Sorry I brought that up.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.480]   I'm really sorry I brought that up.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:54.160]   Gmail, I love this, has offering free calls for all US service members if they're calling
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.800]   home no matter where they are in the world.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.640]   I think that's really, really cool.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.920]   You need a valid.mil email address on your Google account.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:09.440]   And of course, you have to have the Google Gmail voice plug in.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.440]   And that's really cool.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.520]   I think that's just a nice way to acknowledge people who are serving in the US military.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.480]   For all the troops overseas to call friends and family at home.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.880]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880]   That's great.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.880]   Also offline Gmail.
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.200]   Oh, what?
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.200]   Which is, yeah, kind of a big deal.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.960]   But kind of weirdly implemented.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.840]   So Google announces Gmail goes offline, but it's a Chrome app.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.240]   It's an offline Gmail Chrome app.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.520]   So you install the Chrome app.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.640]   And then when you do, it shows up in the new tab when you open Chrome and you have to give
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.160]   it permission to grab your Gmail offline.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.800]   And then once you do that, Calendar and Docs can go offline as well.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.400]   So it's not quite the way gears used to work.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.240]   I kind of expected that it was going to work inside Gmail itself.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.520]   But you just install this.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.520]   You do have to install this Chrome app and all together.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.760]   So if I just search for the-- I found a Gmail app in the Chrome Web Store.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.760]   That's it?
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.240]   It's offline Google mail.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.760]   Oh, it's called offline Google mail.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.600]   Offline Google mail.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.360]   Of course, that's what I would have searched for.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360]   Offline.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.360]   There you go.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360]   This is just a kinder coming.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.200]   Offline Calendar's promise is rolling out really soon.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:15.960]   Oh, this is cool.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.000]   An offline calendar, I definitely need.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.240]   OK, so offline Google mail is a Gmail app to build.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:21.800]   That's cool.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.120]   So it somehow caches it?
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.840]   Wait, who's that?
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.840]   Hi.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.000]   It's Chris Devona.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.240]   I'm so confused.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:29.840]   What just happened?
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.480]   Is that Lewis Gray?
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.560]   Oh, is this Leo LePor?
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.760]   Hey, congratulations on your new gig.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.960]   You're a nuclear.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.040]   Oh, thank you very much.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.000]   Did you come running down to the conference room
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.720]   so that you could just say hi?
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.760]   For you, Leo, anything.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.800]   In terms of being a nuclear, I'm trying to make the ramp up almost zero.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.960]   I don't have a whole lot of patience for trying to find a role.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.880]   So we're having a lot of fun.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.920]   There's a lot of work to do, and this was a very interesting opportunity.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.920]   Obviously, I've been working with teams like Google
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.440]   and a number of other people in this space for a long time.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.400]   And through all the interactions as a partner, blogger,
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.200]   the culture here is really strong.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.640]   They have real good integrity, and that's
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.360]   something I didn't want to miss.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.360]   And so it's been a great opportunity to come in and have impact right away.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.160]   Are you going to be working with Natalie or how--
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:16.200]   it sounds like your duties overlap a little bit.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.480]   So Natalie and I work wrong really well.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.440]   I mean, she's one of the many great community managers
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.240]   we have on Google+, my role is more in the product marketing side.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:27.280]   And so what that means is helping really shape our vision,
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.080]   shape the way that the product is communicated,
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.320]   helping to prove the differentiation of what we've developed here at Google+.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.720]   Well, that's-- I mean, that's like kind of a dream job.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.720]   I mean, right.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.360]   I mean, you're going to be using Google+, anyway.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.280]   You might as well get paid to do it.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.040]   Oh, that's my opinion as well.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.480]   Kind of like having your own radio show and having people show up.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.920]   Oh, yeah, that.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.040]   Well, hey, I'm not saying I didn't pick the best job for me.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.280]   But I think it's just great when people get to do exactly what they want.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:00.040]   Follow Louis Gray on Google+ and I'm sure we'll hear a lot more of you.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.640]   Congratulations.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.160]   Thank you.
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.160]   And I see great people like Chris DeBona.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.560]   I mean, I've never had a position where I come in and like 50 of my best friends
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.400]   already work there.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.400]   If you can imagine how cool that is.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.640]   So people who I've interacted with either as a power user, blogger, partner,
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:16.920]   just show up and they're here.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.800]   And so I hate to be feeling like Mr. Popular a little bit,
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.240]   but the lunch calendar has been pretty full and it's been great to bounce ideas off.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.920]   And here are all the internal stuff that they've wanted to tell me for so long
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.000]   that now they can tell me.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.240]   And it's free now?
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.560]   Well, Google+ has always been free now.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.920]   No, the lunch.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.200]   Lunch at Google has always been free.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.200]   I have not been free for you.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:39.960]   That's awesome.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:40.760]   That's really great.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   And so when did you start?
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.760]   I started last Monday and they have a quick ramp up
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.840]   nuclear process for us marketing people.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.080]   We don't have to take a lot of classes because they just assume a low bar of
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   expectations.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.520]   Yeah, you guys are not engineers.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.080]   So I was done like day two, they get into benefits and they're like,
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.960]   you're free and the rest of the engineers have to stay back and work.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.600]   That's the way it is around here.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.760]   They assume that if we know how to use a computer and access Wi-Fi,
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.000]   that's all we really need.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.920]   Now my question is, do they make you hang this thing around your neck and wear a beanie
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.320]   with a propeller or is that something you chose to do?
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.680]   They have a process of nuclear orientation, which includes wearing the
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.520]   nuclear beanie.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:23.400]   It's a rite of passage and I think tens of thousands of people before me have done it.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.800]   There's no reason I should be exempt.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.800]   So I was more than happy to do that.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.240]   I knew that the picture itself would get exposed through the many
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.560]   pop bratsy we have on campus.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.680]   So I took control of it myself and put it out myself.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.400]   Here it is, Eileen, on my computer.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:39.800]   This is Lewis Gray in a beanie with a sign around his neck that says he's product
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.000]   marketing manager plus.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.240]   It's really degrees in university.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.760]   The degrees in university.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.520]   Yeah, and fun fact about yourself.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.120]   Three kids.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.400]   Three kids, three and under.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.040]   Three and under.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.120]   I don't know if that's a fun fact, but it's certainly a fact.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.360]   It's a fact.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.960]   Some of the other people I came in with this year, they're 2010 graduates,
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.000]   which kind of reminds me how well they are.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:04.480]   Wow.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.960]   So they go back to degrees and I have to explain to them the back in the day.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.640]   We used to have mass communications and things called newspapers.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.160]   And they just kind of glaze over.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:13.920]   That's great.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.280]   Well, congratulations.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.280]   It's really great to talk to you, Lewis.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.720]   And it's nice.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.560]   I appreciate it.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.840]   I think they hired the right guy for the job, I have to say.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.200]   Thank you.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.360]   There's so much work to do.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.160]   It's a great intersection of fantastic people and great technology,
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.280]   but also significant work to be done.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.840]   You know, if this was a slam dunk, they wouldn't need someone like me
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.640]   and the many other people like Natalie who do a great job.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.240]   Well, let's get you on any time you want to announce a new product.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:40.760]   Let us know.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.160]   I appreciate it.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:44.360]   Yeah, you got a carte blanche any time to join us.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:44.880]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.000]   Let me hand you back to Chris.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.640]   He's got much better looking hair.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.160]   And I don't know about that.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.080]   He's got more of it.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.640]   Let's put it that way.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.240]   Hi, guys.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.280]   That was fun.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.440]   That was fun.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.400]   Did Eileen do that?
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.920]   No, she she she I didn't give her any warnings.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.080]   Yeah, I just saw it.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.400]   Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky, sneaky.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.240]   A couple more Google stories.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.600]   Google has launched with the New York Times,
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.720]   a YouTube channel to commemorate September 11th.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.280]   We're coming up on that 10 year anniversary.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.560]   And that's going to be, of course, a gigantic story
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.600]   everywhere in the media.
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:26.080]   And the YouTube's got the jump on this with a lot of--
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.480]   this is actually going to be a really interesting site.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.000]   A lot of videos.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.560]   I wish they'd do this with all modern historical events.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.880]   Because what a resource this would
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.640]   be to go back if you're a student,
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:44.840]   want to know more about 9/11, or you just want to relive it.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.320]   Having all these videos online is incredible.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.360]   I think the archive that org also
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.000]   has this archive of September 11th media coverage videos as well.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.400]   I mean, I think we're going to see a lot of this
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.000]   with the 10 year anniversary.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.200]   But yeah, I lost the morning a couple of weeks ago just
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.440]   looking through some of this material.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.640]   It's amazing.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.320]   It feels like so long ago.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.200]   And yet it feels like so recently.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:09.700]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.680]   And of course, you were there.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.520]   You were in New York.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.400]   So this has a particularly strong meaning for you.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.440]   And I know Jeff was too.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.040]   We've talked about that before.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.080]   Understanding 9/11, a television news
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.160]   archive is on archive.org.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.240]   Similar, a little bit less--
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.840]   a little more text heavy, but similar idea.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.960]   Less googly, but some similar idea.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:38.000]   You know, I have to think that if you think about 2001,
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.400]   you know, this was kind of at the time when everything then
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:46.200]   was starting to be camera phones and people
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.600]   were doing their own report.
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.240]   This is the beginning of that.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:53.120]   So I think you'll see more and more archives of this kind
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.320]   of tweets.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.600]   I guess Twitter wasn't around yet at the time.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.880]   Facebook wasn't around.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.000]   I was slashed out when this happened.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.880]   And I remember just how much we were working on-- well,
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:07.200]   mostly Robin, the guy is working on keeping the site running
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.000]   and useful for other people.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:09.520]   Right.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.880]   It was really an interesting time.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.160]   For an event like this to happen again now,
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.920]   you can automate gathering that this data in ways
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:18.920]   that we couldn't back then.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.040]   I remember back then, a friend of mine
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:24.040]   was one guy I knew carried a Canon ELF, one of the first small
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.000]   cameras in his pocket.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.680]   And he got all these amazing photos.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.840]   And I didn't have a camera on me.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.040]   And that's when I started carrying camera.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.440]   But now, you know, these days, you can gather that information.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.680]   And you can automate that gathering, capturing so quickly.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:39.480]   You'll get ready, because this is just the beginning of every event
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:42.200]   now will be hyper documented and archived.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.440]   And that's what archive.org.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.920]   We should give them a big plug.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:48.240]   BrewsterCalesArchive.org is amazing,
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:52.640]   because their goal is to save the internet on big hard drives
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:56.200]   distributed around the world so that historians can go back
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.760]   and look at this stuff.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.120]   And it's terabytes a day.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.960]   I don't know exactly how much they're saving,
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.040]   but it's a ton of stuff.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.640]   And what's great about Brewster and about this project
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.280]   is just ignoring copyrights right and left.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.880]   They say, we'll work it out later.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.560]   We're just going to save everything.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:17.840]   And we'll figure out how the archives work later.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.640]   I want to take a little break.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.880]   It looks like we've lost Chris Tobono.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.920]   We're having all of everybody's dropping off bit by bit here.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.360]   Yeah, you just call them back.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.720]   Actually, yeah.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.560]   Go ahead, because I was just going to talk about new tech.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:32.680]   And that's where you push a lot of buttons on your console.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.760]   But you're going to be busy.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.840]   You're going to be busy right now.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.040]   I think you can multitask.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:36.880]   Can you multitask?
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.200]   Do both at the same time?
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.200]   That's right.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:44.040]   Our video switcher is about the most sophisticated thing
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.600]   you ever heard of.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.960]   It is a video truck in a box.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.240]   I used it since day one.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:52.720]   I mean, I did a lot of research when I first
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.600]   started doing live video.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.280]   I started with a webcam on a computer.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:59.000]   But when I realized I wanted multiple cameras,
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.280]   I said, I need a switcher.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.200]   And I looked at all different kinds of ways to do it.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.760]   And there was nothing more affordable, more effective,
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.240]   more powerful than the TriCaster.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.480]   And so since 2006, I've been using a TriCaster,
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.320]   but, bam, this new one we were using, the 850 Extreme.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.960]   Unbelievable.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.960]   You see how it goes to black like that?
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.280]   That's--
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.920]   Wow!
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.120]   The transitions.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.920]   We don't use half of the stuff it does,
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.600]   including all of the virtual sets.
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.760]   Just amazing.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.600]   Those are some of the fun transitions.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.680]   But really, the fact that we have eight cameras
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.280]   that we can switch back and forth from the ability
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:40.000]   to record each of those individual cameras individually
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.240]   with ISOs.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.200]   Amazing.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.680]   Support for Apple AirPlay.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.360]   We're able to actually take our iPads and play video back
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.440]   through the TriCaster.
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.480]   It's just incredible.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.280]   If you're looking for something with the state-of-the-art
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.360]   capabilities that put even the big networks to shame--
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.400]   and by the way, that's why a lot of big networks are starting
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.840]   to look at TriCaster.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.360]   It's being used by everybody from the NBA.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:09.400]   Well, in fact, I love it because we're in this panoply
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.960]   of people who use the new tech TriCaster.
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.760]   But some big broadcasters as well.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.520]   This thing is incredible.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.200]   Highly recommend you take a look at the TriCaster
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.960]   and the new TriCaster 850.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:28.000]   MTV, NHL, VH1, Fox News, CNET, BBC, Mahalo, ESPN Radio, NBA
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.680]   Development League, Fox Sports, CBS Radio, X Games, Sky News.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.440]   I know you have that little thing called twit.tv.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.920]   Newtech.com, if you want to find out.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.280]   Ow!
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.680]   That's gab me.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:43.680]   You can gab me.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.080]   Well, apparently Google has a massive internet outage
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.720]   and we're not able to get anybody back.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.960]   I don't know what's going on here.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.640]   Yeah, that's what Chris said.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.760]   He said the network just stalled.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.720]   So keep trying to call him.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.200]   That happened yesterday on our Twitter photo.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.120]   We were talking to a photographer.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.760]   Apparently the landlord had forgotten to pay the power bill.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.040]   And in the middle of the interview,
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.600]   his electricity-- not just the internet.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.160]   His electricity goes out.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.040]   I think this is a breaking story.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:10.960]   Google down.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.560]   Networked down at the Google plug.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.600]   That works down.
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.680]   James Gosling, leaving Google for a startup.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.720]   He was only there a few months.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.160]   Gosling, the guy who created Java,
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.640]   wasn't real happy when the sun got purchased by Oracle,
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.120]   left almost immediately and went to Google.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.440]   And now he's moved on to-- in March,
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.440]   he's moved on to a company that he worked with at Google,
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.040]   a company called Liquid Robotics, which
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.560]   has to be about the coolest company I've ever heard of.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.360]   He's the chief software architect there.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:46.720]   They're using autonomous vehicles to map the ocean,
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.680]   a fleet of autonomous submarines that then have--
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.360]   Yes.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.360]   With a variety of onboard sensors and they upload that data
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.680]   to the cloud-- whoops, I guess there's nothing at that link.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.680]   Maybe our internet went down, too.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.680]   Do you think it was us?
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.680]   Hmm.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.680]   Seems like everybody's--
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:08.680]   Nope, I'm working.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.680]   I'm working, yeah.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680]   Yeah, couldn't be.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.680]   Yeah, thank you for the logic.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.680]   A little dose of logic never hurt.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:14.680]   Yeah, everybody else is here.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.680]   So it can't be us.
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.680]   Liquid Robotics makes the wave glider.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.680]   I think that's a cool job.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.680]   This sounds like a really cool job.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.680]   I can see going from the giant that is Google to want to go
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:27.680]   to a small startup.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.680]   And how happy was it at Google?
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.680]   But boy, when something like this comes along,
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.680]   I've got the image here, Eileen, of the wave glider,
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:40.680]   an unmanned maritime vehicle that looks like a solar power.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:41.680]   So it's not a submarine.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.680]   It covers the surface.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.680]   Wave gliders provide a persistent ocean presence
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.680]   for commercial, scientific, and defense users.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.680]   Ooh.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.680]   Ooh.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.680]   And then they have a video on when sharks attack robots.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.680]   You might want to check out.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.680]   Shark wings over, but not the sharks.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.680]   The sharks continue on.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.680]   I doubled up, Adam, just so that hopefully the connection
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.680]   will be--
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.680]   Look.
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.680]   Oh, nice.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.680]   Look at that.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:10.680]   As we wait for Chris.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.680]   Yeah, we're done with Chris.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.680]   We don't need him anymore.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.680]   Adam, have you seen the blogger redesign?
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.680]   I think, when I was talking about those sites that have gone
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.680]   away, like MySpace and Dig, you know,
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.680]   sites that are dying-- by the way, they mentioned gawker.com,
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.680]   I won't say anymore.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:29.680]   Not Life Hacker, but just the gawker site itself.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:30.680]   This was the Fox.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.680]   That was the Fox News thing.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.680]   Fox News, yeah.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.680]   Yeah, which I guess says something right.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:40.680]   But I couldn't actually disagree with the list.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:44.680]   One of the sites they said was kind of disappearing was blogger
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:48.680]   in terms of dropping usage.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.680]   But they also mentioned that Type Hat and other blogging platforms
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.680]   had seen dramatically dropped usage as well.
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.680]   And I think that's probably true as more and more of us use Google
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.680]   Plus and Twitter and stuff to do our blogging.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:00.680]   Well, and Tumblr, right?
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.680]   Tumblr, too, right.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.680]   However, Google has redesigned and relaunched blogger with a brand new
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:13.680]   design that essentially they say they've rewritten the entire application
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.680]   from scratch, which I guess would make it a kind of a more of a
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.680]   HTML5 kind of a thing.
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:24.680]   I don't think that everyone can see it, right?
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.680]   It's a draft.blogger.com.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680]   Let's see here.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.680]   I'm going to go there.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:29.680]   Draft.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.680]   I think that's their kind of beta test.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.680]   Not, not Blooger.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:34.680]   Blogger.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.680]   Okay.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.680]   I don't even want to know what I would get if I did that.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:38.680]   Let's see.
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.680]   Is this it?
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.680]   This looks different.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:42.680]   That is it.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680]   This looks different.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:44.680]   Wow.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:48.680]   And out of MacSpan, let's look at my wave blog.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.680]   I haven't seen that in a while.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.680]   Page views are up today.
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.680]   Somebody visited it.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.680]   It's been zero.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.680]   Now I have two page views today alone.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.680]   That's incredible.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.680]   So this is the management, right?
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.680]   This is not the blog look, but that's cool.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:17.960]   Yeah, and the whole redesign is very much in line with the Gmail, Docs, G-Cal, Google
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.680]   classification of the Google sites.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:21.680]   It looks good.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.440]   You think it's Larry Page involved there?
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.680]   Why all of a sudden is Google redesigning everything?
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:30.720]   Or do you think this was something that was in place before and they're just getting
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:31.720]   around to us just coincidental?
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:36.680]   I mean, if you look at it and like GWT, you know, and just apply it to everything.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.680]   Right.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.680]   GWGWT.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   Anything else applies?
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.680]   Exactly.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.680]   Right.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:46.680]   If you look at the old blogger interface, though, I mean, it's a huge, huge difference
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680]   and a huge improvement.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:53.680]   I mean, yeah, improvement necessarily, but like it looks very old-webby at this point.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.680]   And the new one, it's like it's nice, it's clean.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:00.680]   Blogger really did start to, was starting to look pretty antiquated, huh?
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:03.680]   Yeah, it's about time.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:06.680]   Oh, and there goes, no, Adam's back.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.680]   Kind of fixes.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.680]   I mean, because he's very pixelated.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.680]   Wait a minute, maybe it's just a little dirty.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.680]   There's a little smudge out his face.
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.680]   He's becoming a monster.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.600]   But Gina, you're rock solid.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.160]   You're rock solid.
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.160]   Love that.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.400]   No, it's really reliable.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.520]   So is Facebook getting out of check-ins?
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.560]   I mean, they're the places, Facebook places, which was launched with such fanfare a year
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.600]   ago, everybody said, "That's it.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.600]   Four squares history."
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:33.600]   I said that.
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.600]   Goodbye.
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.600]   Four square Facebook's in the check-in.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.600]   Now, it's all over.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:42.960]   Now, apparently, they've kind of eliminated check-ins from Facebook.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:43.960]   Four square wins.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.520]   Yeah, I mean, they just didn't get the usage.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.680]   So does that mean that most people don't want to set-in?
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:51.680]   That's what it really means.
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.920]   Or does it mean that four squares just really good at the check-in game?
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.400]   Four squares, really fun.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:57.400]   It's one of my...
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.600]   I check out all the time.
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:30:59.760]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.760]   I love it.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:04.320]   But I know a lot of people who are like, are not even close to even wanting to install
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.320]   it kind of thing.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.360]   It really took me...
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.680]   It's probably a niche.
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.680]   Yeah, it is.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:10.680]   It is a niche thing.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.080]   And four square is really good at it.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.720]   They're super good at the gaming back of the mechanics.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.720]   They own the niche.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.720]   They own it.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.480]   And I think they were just focused on that one geo thing.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.120]   Facebook has so many other things going on.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.560]   I think they wanted to see what the uptake is.
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.360]   I think that was Facebook going, "Hey, let's see.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.160]   Do people want to check in or not?"
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.200]   And they just must not have seen the usage.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.200]   And some like M.G.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.520]   Seagler say, "This isn't an abandonment of places.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.520]   They just put it everywhere.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.520]   They don't have a dedicated check-in anymore.
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:37.400]   Just every time you post a status, you could say, "And I'm here."
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.000]   That's kind of like Google+.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.040]   It's a check-in and latitude and Google+.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.840]   Maybe that's the way to do it because I think you're right.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.920]   I think there's not going to be that many people like you and me who want to play the
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.920]   game.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.920]   I want to be the mayor.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.920]   Right.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.920]   Hey, Krista Bonas back.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.920]   Sorry about that.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.680]   No, it's good to have you back.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:00.480]   So no truth to those rumors that there was a massive internet outage at the Google plugs.
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.480]   There might be.
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:02.480]   I switched.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:05.160]   I have patience levels that expire.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:11.200]   So I try Google guest and then I go over to my tethered off of 4G thing.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.720]   So you're on 4G now?
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:13.720]   Yes.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:14.720]   Wow, it looks good.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.720]   Yeah, it looks good.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:16.720]   Looks great.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:17.720]   Off your phone?
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.720]   Actually off of my tablet.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.720]   Oh, your tablet.
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.720]   Wow.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:21.720]   Very cool.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.720]   Which tablet is that?
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.120]   I can't imagine which one.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.840]   One with-- is there an Android tablet with 3G?
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:30.840]   4G?
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:34.000]   No, I must be using only 3G then.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.200]   The rumor mill is going crazy.
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:40.760]   We know nothing.
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.760]   I know nothing.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.200]   We know nothing.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:51.280]   Facebook, according to possibly anyway, according to CNBC, will be launching a music service
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.280]   September 22nd.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:54.280]   Wow.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:33:01.800]   They'll be doing it with three partners, Spotify, RDO and MOG.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:05.200]   That actually isn't like you're launching a music service, which means you're building
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.440]   those into Facebook, right?
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.640]   It's like Skype deal.
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:16.800]   They're calling it Facebook vibes, according to Jeff Rose, who found the string in a download
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.800]   link.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:23.080]   Well, that's a good way to do it.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:27.840]   Be interesting to have a Facebook-- that would certainly be a compelling offering since so
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.000]   many people live in Facebook.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.520]   It just makes it more sticky.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:37.600]   You never have to leave Facebook.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.600]   Cricuts.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.920]   My son has learned how to do a Cricut sound.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.680]   And I thought, God, you've got to teach me how to do that.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:45.240]   I'd be so useful on this show.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.640]   Like with his mouth?
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.640]   Huh.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.000]   You've got to get a recording of that.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000]   It's really good.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000]   It sounds like Cricuts.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   Yeah, that's a line.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.680]   I'm trying to figure out how to do it.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:58.960]   Can you write a life hacker article at him?
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.880]   Adam, Adam, how to use a guy.
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:01.880]   Come on.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:02.880]   Cricut sounds.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:03.880]   Oh, please.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.840]   I can't read it.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.120]   It has something to do with.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.800]   It involves whistling and spit.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:10.800]   That's all I know.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:18.460]   How does my Cricut sound like a quail?
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:20.460]   That's a wookie.
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:25.460]   It's a little bit different.
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:28.380]   The producer has now tried to attempt to get us back.
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:29.380]   Oh, my God.
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:30.380]   It's so late.
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:31.380]   I didn't realize it was so late.
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.380]   Thank you.
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:35.900]   I just was having too much fun because I have such a great cast with me, Adam Pash, Chris
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:40.540]   Dibona, and Gina Trapani, who will now give us her tip of the week.
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:41.540]   Okay.
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:46.380]   You can speed up your web connection using Open DNS or Google DNS.
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.380]   And it works.
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:48.380]   I tried it.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:49.380]   Did you try it?
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:50.380]   Yes.
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.380]   It's a little bit different.
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.220]   It could be completely psychological.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:54.220]   Let me see.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:58.140]   I want to make sure that I get this right.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:02.140]   Google Public DNS and Open DNS are partnering with CDNs.
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:07.060]   Together they actually take location information from your IP address and serve you content
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.940]   from servers which are closer to you.
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:13.540]   That's why web pages seem faster.
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:17.580]   And yeah, so all you have to do is you don't have to use Google Public DNS.
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:23.300]   You can use Open DNS as well and not all CDNs, excuse me, are in on the deal, but a few
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:24.300]   major ones are.
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:26.980]   So that just started yesterday.
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:27.980]   That's awesome.
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:28.980]   So switch your DNS.
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:32.420]   If you're using your ISP's DNS, switch to Open DNS or Google DNS and you should see some
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:34.180]   speedups, especially around YouTube.
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:38.940]   I've been using Open DNS and maybe it's completely psychological because there's definitely
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:41.020]   placebo effect with these kinds of announcements.
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:42.500]   But I really noticed a difference yesterday.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.140]   It was like, wow, at home I use Open DNS.
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:46.140]   Very cool.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:51.020]   Adam Pash is going to fill in with Jeff Jarvis's number of the week, Adam.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:59.780]   Yes, so this week's number is 8,868, which is the number of tweets per second that were
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:07.940]   spawned by Beyonce's pregnancy announcement that beat the former tweets per second leader,
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:13.740]   which was I believe last month the Women's World Cup final between the US and Japan.
[01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:17.540]   So 8,868 tweets per second.
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:21.980]   I think that's more of a measure of the growth of Twitter than anything else because you
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:24.380]   know, Ben Lodden's death was only 5,000.
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:26.540]   It's just how much bigger Twitter is all the time.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:30.140]   Well, I think technically it's a measure of the growth of Beyonce.
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:38.140]   It was also the MTV audience, you know, because this happens in the same days.
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.900]   And the celebrity, the Hollywood tie-in at Twitter.
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:42.900]   Yeah.
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:43.900]   And it's Beyonce.
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:44.900]   And it's Beyonce.
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:49.220]   Normally, this number made me sad because the White House only got like, I don't know,
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.900]   at the time I thought it was a lot.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:51.900]   It was several thousand.
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:55.980]   It's almost 8,600 tweets a second.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:56.980]   It's not just total.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:57.980]   It's a second.
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:00.580]   Yeah, that's amazing brew put.
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.060]   Wow.
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:06.060]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would normally do a tool of the week here, but I think since
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:11.740]   Krista Bonas here, I'm going to spring this one on you, Krista, but something that you
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:17.460]   use, a Google or Android tool that you use and you just think is great and you wish more
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:18.740]   people knew about it.
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.820]   Is there anything out there like that?
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:24.820]   Well, I mean, I've been really, really, really enjoying Google music.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:28.900]   I installed a Bluetooth transceiver in my car, which is a little older, so it doesn't
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:29.900]   have one.
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:30.900]   Yep.
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:31.900]   And it's just, it's fantastic.
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:32.900]   I have to say, I agree with you.
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.180]   I've been having a great time.
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:38.700]   I've got some invites left, not very many, but just text me yourself.
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:43.300]   Any knowledge about when that might be a public debate is private beta right now, right?
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:46.300]   Well, it's like they're invites we can send out or whatever.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:47.300]   Right.
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:48.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:49.300]   So I have no idea.
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:50.300]   I have eight remaining invites myself.
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:51.300]   Yes.
[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:52.300]   How many I have?
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:53.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:55.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:56.300]   Between the four of us, we can.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:57.540]   We could be able to cover the whole audience, I think, very easily here.
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.940]   Well, if we were more popular, it'd be one thing.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.340]   Hey, you have dead mouse.
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:02.900]   You have dead mouse.
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.660]   And now five, dead mouse.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.140]   How do you pronounce that?
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:07.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:08.140]   Love that, that is.
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:10.140]   Great.
[01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:18.700]   No, I have to say there is a lot of, well, and now is a lot of music choices out there.
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:23.380]   I'm a big Spotify fan, but having all of your music online, I'd be curious to see.
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:29.060]   We've heard rumors at Apple's iTunes match will do something similar, but having all
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:32.580]   your music online and not having to download it to your phone to listen to it is great.
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:35.820]   There's actually some debate about whether Apple's going to do that or not.
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:39.460]   Initially they were saying, oh, yeah, they'll be streaming from Apple's iTunes match.
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:40.820]   Now Apple's saying, well, not exactly.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:43.860]   You have to download it and cash it and play it as you download it.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.860]   These deals, the music companies are so hard.
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:47.860]   Yeah, they're tough.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:48.860]   They're so hard.
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:49.860]   They're tough.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:50.860]   But if you own the song, you've uploaded it.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:55.260]   And I have, I think I have some, I don't know how many songs I have on my Google music.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:58.020]   I think it's six or seven thousand, something like that.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:38:59.020]   Wow.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:06.540]   I will piggyback quickly on Chris's tool because I wrote a Google music extension for Chrome
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:13.460]   that adds last FM, Scroggling and artist bios and album bios and stuff like that to,
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:15.460]   to Chrome when you're using Google music.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:16.460]   That's great.
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:17.460]   Thank you.
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:18.460]   Throw that in.
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:25.260]   Yeah, I have 9,334 or 314 songs, 44 hours worth of music on my Google music.
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:26.260]   Wow.
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.740]   I love it.
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:29.740]   And I just added two free cuts from Beirut.
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:30.740]   I don't know.
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:31.740]   Yeah, I did it.
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:32.740]   I did too.
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:34.140]   Yeah, they just offered it.
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.140]   I don't know what that is.
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:36.140]   That's something new.
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:37.500]   All right, my friends.
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:38.500]   Thank you so much.
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:39.500]   What a great show this has been.
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:42.860]   I'm sorry I dragged it on to Tom here at my apologies, but I couldn't stop because we
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:44.660]   had Adam Pash from Life Hacker.
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:45.660]   He's the editor in chief.
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:46.820]   It's always great to have you on.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:48.660]   Thank you for joining us, Adam.
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:51.980]   From Google, we had Lewis Gray and Chris Dibona.
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:52.980]   We love it.
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:53.980]   There's Lewis.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:54.980]   We're about to say goodbye.
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:40:00.140]   It's really great to talk to you, dibona.com, and he can follow him on Twitter @seedibona.
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:01.900]   What is your Google+ handle?
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:02.900]   It's a seedibona.
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:06.060]   I didn't know how the numbers off my head to put up there.
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:07.740]   No, I think that's the way to do it, actually.
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.380]   It was for me as a seedibona.
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:11.740]   And I'd love to have you chat with me there.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:14.340]   Do you ever do any hangouts?
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:16.740]   I've done like one or two.
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:19.540]   You know, I have kids and the wives and, well, one wife.
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:20.540]   Kids and wives.
[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:24.940]   Boy, you know, I thought Lewis was busy with three kids, but multiple wives.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:25.940]   Wow.
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:26.940]   Hide your kids.
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:27.940]   Hide your wives, Chris.
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:30.020]   It's the hair, baby.
[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:32.540]   He's the Fabio of open source.
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:34.860]   Thank you, Chris Dibona, for joining us.
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:37.260]   Great to have you.
[01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:39.540]   And Gina Trepania, as always, a real pleasure.
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:40.540]   Gina's at Life.
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:42.220]   I'm sorry, I almost said Life Hacker.
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:46.980]   At smarterware.org, she founded Life Hacker, and she's also Gina Trepania on Twitter and
[01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:47.980]   Google+.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:48.980]   Great episode today.
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:53.860]   And I just want to thank all the listeners who left new reviews and iTunes for Twig.
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:54.860]   We really appreciate it.
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:55.860]   Yay.
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:56.860]   They cleaned it up.
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:57.860]   Yay.
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:58.860]   We appreciate it.
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:01.740]   Yeah, I didn't even look, but thank you.
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:03.340]   That's really nice of you to do that.
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:07.020]   We do this show every Wednesday afternoon, 1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern at Twit.
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.020]   I don't have to say live anymore.
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:10.940]   It's Twit.tv right on the front page of our new site.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:13.020]   Check that out, Twit.tv.
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:17.220]   But if you missed the show, we've got a whole page of Twig page with show notes and all

[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:38.440]   (upbeat music)
