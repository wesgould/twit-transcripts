[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.320]   the show we cover the latest in the Google verse with Jeff Jarvis, professor of
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   journalism. Let me get my crib sheet here. The Leonard Tab professor of
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.320]   journalistic innovation at the Craig Neumard Graduate School of Journalism at the
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   University of New York. Hello, Jeffrey. Hello, boss. How are you?
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   I'm good. You got a whiteboard. Have you been teaching from me?
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.320]   So I did a, whatever, I did an event on journalism education with South Africa
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.320]   at 6 a.m. Wow. And who knew that the sun rises just that way? Oh, now we know.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   So I had to put the whiteboard there this morning. I've been on Zoom nonstop
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   since then. I'll get rid of it at some point. Do you get Zoom fatigue? I got Zoom
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.160]   fatigue. What should I do? Oh, man. It's all. Also with a Stacey Higgin
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.240]   bathroom from Stacey on IOT.com and the IOT podcast with Kevin Tofel. So do you get
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.280]   Zoom fatigue Stacey? I do. Well, I get talking fatigue. So like today I'll do
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.320]   the show. I can do my show. Yeah, I'm an introvert. Hardcore. Well, it's funny because
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   maybe because of the way we do this. I don't get fatigue from doing this. I mean, I do this
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   all day, you know, for the last 15 years. But the minute I'm starting to, you know,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.320]   I did three Zoom calls on Friday. I did a, we had a college reunion, which was really
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   fun with about 15 people from, from, uh, Trumbull College. That was really, really fun.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.320]   And then, but before that I had a family meeting and before that I had another conference call
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.320]   with the, with for Twit. And it was like, by the end of the day, I was like, like,
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   exhausted. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And it wasn't as much talking as I do probably in a normal day.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   I think it's very hard, um, to do eye contact and you are thinking a lot more about how
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   to connect with people. Right. And you're also like, when we're talking, like, if we were in
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.320]   person, I wouldn't be always looking and focused at the screen. Right. I would probably be like
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   doing other things. But you get that when you were doing the show. I do. But that's just because
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.320]   I don't talk that often. Right. My husband and I can actually have an entire meal and not
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.320]   say I love that. I love that. Would you rather have a Zoom call or an old fashioned phone
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   conference call, a Zoom call? Phone. Really? I love talking to people on the phone because I
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   can walk, I can process better. As long as it's interactive, if someone's just talking at
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   me, then I don't really care. This is pretty easy for me because I'm not looking at you. I'm not
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   looking at you. I'm not really doing anything. I don't know. Maybe it's just because it's
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   my native habitat, but I'm just very relaxed. It's also Leo. I think it's about the distance
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   to the screen and that might be it. Because if I were speaking, you've got a whole room in
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   front of you. You had that thing right in front of you. Yeah, maybe that's all right. I was
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.320]   so surprised. And I feel bad for people who are living on Zoom these days. I care too much.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   I think for this show, I'm like, no, I have to make my point. It's very important. It's just
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   a podcast. So if you were a Twitter employee, you had the option. Would you choose to go
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   back to the office or would you choose not to? It's really interesting as we are starting to
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   come back out of our pause in many parts of this country. The big tech companies have had
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.320]   different reactions to this. Right. Jack Dorsey said, you don't ever have to come back. If
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.960]   you're working at home and it's working for you, stay home. Apple has already started
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.920]   to bring people back. Same. No, no, we want you to come back. Google said you don't have
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.480]   to come back till the end of 2020, till after the year, till 2021. I think Facebook said
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.040]   the same thing. So there is this. Obviously, there's some jobs like Jeff who's running
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.800]   our board, our engineering staff. They have to be there. But there's a lot of jobs we
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.120]   do here that can be done from home. We didn't, in the past, we haven't liked it because we
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.360]   feel like, well, we don't know what's going on. We like everybody to be in the office at
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.320]   the same time, but I'm not in a hurry to bring people back by any means. We've already told
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.680]   people, you know, even if other businesses are coming back, since we're able to do business
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.240]   without subjecting you to health risks, we see no reason to do that.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.120]   This is a weird question. It probably doesn't work because business is so different right
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.080]   now. But do you think your efficiency is better, worse, similar to what it was when
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.080]   it was in the office?
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:24.960]   Yesterday, I had to yell at people for putting too many animated gifts in this slack. I said,
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.120]   guys, I can't, there's all this stuff. I can't, there's, this is an important channel
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.240]   for new information. I need to see, I can't, there's too many dancing.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:42.040]   So they knock that off. We do have channels though, in our slack for fun. Right. Because
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.480]   you know, and so people, and I feel like you've killed it in the main channel. Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.320]   Yeah. Yeah. Now there's all these Leo as the Grinch gifts running around. You just don't
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.960]   see it. I deserve them. I admit it. But we have like a staff lunch where everybody gets
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.200]   on the Zoom and eats their lunch, which is, I don't participate in that. Thank God, I'm
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.400]   busy. So can I mention my favorite story of the day? Yes. The fact that Google employees
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.880]   had to be warned not to charge their, their lunches at home to the expensive count. They,
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.920]   they don't know what life is like having to buy lunch. Oh my gosh, that is funny. Oh,
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.000]   this is not the best. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's a little bit of Hutzpah to charge
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.920]   your home lunch to your ex-vetsica. Well, I'm working, but it is. They are working, right?
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.840]   And they used to get lunch. They used to get lunch for free. That's why they're doing
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:39.200]   it. But wow, the real world is so hard on it is. Yeah. So there were gifts around the
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.000]   office of people people when the, as soon as they're back, they're going to eat 24 hours.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.840]   Oh my goodness. Wow. So I will say having, having worked from home and virtually since
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:08:00.240]   2004, I would never go into an office if I had like, I am remote for life. Remote for
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:08.160]   life. I am less productive. And the best tools that we have had were Slack was excellent
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.680]   and allowed you to feel connected to your people. Right. I would go on reporting trips.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.000]   And I think I would never give those up. Like I could, there's so much you do in person
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.240]   and you wouldn't still want to go do. But being in an office, I am so much less productive
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.800]   when I'm in the office. But you don't know anything Stacey, I was thinking today. So
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.120]   last time I was in San Francisco, I got to see Jack Dorsey. Right. Well, now, well,
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.320]   I'm going to be in San Francisco. Is Jack around? No, actually Jackson Tuscaloosa, he
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.600]   doesn't come in anymore. Right. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. The people you used to
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.080]   be able to meet with, because you were in town may not be in town anymore. Well, we just
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.240]   like that. That actually means that you could have events. That gives actually a good rationalization
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.920]   for events. Yeah. That's true. You haven't seen your own coworkers. Well, so we would
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.320]   always, and I think this is really important, if you're going to do remote work, you have
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:07.880]   to bring people in at least once or twice a year. And that's really essential to, and
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:15.240]   when you do it, you know, we got together for events, obviously, because we did events.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.520]   And then we also got together for like corporate retreats. What's it going to take to feel
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:29.160]   safe flying again? A vaccine? Yeah. Yeah. Or immunity. I don't know. Like so. You've seen,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.480]   I don't know if you've seen these pictures of like plexiglass defiers, like cones of silence
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.440]   over every seat and all sorts of crazy ideas. I saw a restaurant, a restaurant that has
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.600]   already installed shower curtains between the tables. It's not, that's not really why
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.280]   I go to a restaurant. If you're going to sit in the shower booth. That's not fun. That's
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.640]   not fun at all. I kind of like the, the little greenhouses they were building around. Yeah.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:02.040]   Yeah. But that would be very nice. Super hot real fast in the. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.640]   You know, we just have to, I think the best thing to do at this point at, I've decided
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.400]   just to take it one day at a time. I can't, I don't know. I don't know. And you know,
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.280]   the only responsibility I have is to our staff. And I think we've already decided we're going
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.720]   to encourage them to stay home as long as they feel like they can do the job at home.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.440]   That's good for me. Cause I do come in and you know, I feel like I actually have a luxury
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.680]   because I, this is a luxury because I can use this studio and I can use my studio safely.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.760]   And I continue to, but one of the reasons I could do this, I don't let anybody else
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.680]   come in. None of the other hosts, they all have to work from home. I might be going crazy
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.040]   right now if I had to work from home. I don't know if I could do it.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:48.080]   Some shakeups in the pixel division. This story from Nick bestone on the information.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:55.320]   Uh, the apparently the pixel four was such a disappointment that Mark Levois, the guy
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.600]   we saw on stage, the photography guru left the company last month. This is the first
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:09.760]   that exits been reported. And pixel general manager, Mario Kiroz also left both declined
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.360]   to request for comment from the information. Mario did Chromecast before he was in charge
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.600]   of a long time Googler. Yeah. Yeah. He was big. Yeah. Uh, it's strange that Google would
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.040]   blame those executives for the pixel four. I don't think there was anything wrong with
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:33.280]   the camera on the pixel four. Was there no, uh, the problem of the pixel four was the price,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:41.440]   pure and simple. Am I wrong? This was more than a thousand dollars. Maybe the shakeup
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.280]   was related to it. Like they didn't want to work on something like this anymore. Maybe
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.160]   I don't know. We have the four A coming out a little bit delayed, but admittedly, right?
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.560]   Well, yeah, because this right now would be Google IO. We would have had the Google
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.760]   IO keynote yesterday and I would have had a phone in my hand and you probably would have
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.760]   had a four A in your hand. You'd be down there. Uh, you know, I think complaining about the
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:12.880]   lack of pixel books. It's a different man. Join the nauseous. Yeah. Yeah. Google IO
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.840]   is a fun conference to go to. No Google IO. They didn't even say we're going online.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.120]   Microsoft's doing it for a while. They did. And then they stopped. Microsoft's doing
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.320]   its developer conference next week online. Um, Apple is going to do its developer conference
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:33.040]   in June online. A lot of them are still continuing on, but Google said for reasons I don't know.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:39.440]   Hey, we don't even want to do that. Facebook. I was mostly product launches and then the
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.680]   on the back end is the developer stuff that most people don't really cover at the cool
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:52.080]   fun, like that's it. And I. The real stuff. I don't know if you have developer accounts,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.240]   but is Google still sending out information to developers for online training sessions
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:06.120]   and that sort of thing? I don't know. I don't know. This would be one for all about Android
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.880]   team. I should ask Jason, et cetera. By the way, they had a great show yesterday with
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.960]   the head of Google music and you're now YouTube music explaining what's going on there. So
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:22.400]   LaVoy was the guy who talked. Remember last year we were kind of underwhelmed by the
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:29.240]   presentation, except when Mark LaVoy stepped on stage, he was a computer, uh, computational
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:36.000]   photography, uh, pioneer. In fact, he met Larry Page of Sergey Brin when they were grad
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.400]   students at Stanford joined Google about six years ago, but he had been working for Google
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.120]   doing projects at Stanford, like Street View. He worked with Google Glass and the camera
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:54.040]   for its headset. Um, Quarroque Quarroes had been, or how I'm not sure how I'm saying
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:00.600]   that right. Quarroes had been at Google since 2005. 15 years. He was the pixels general
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.040]   manager from the very beginning. So it's unclear. Are these punishments? It's nobody's
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:12.800]   saying, um, apparently according to information as such great sources at a hardware, all hands
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.920]   meeting in the fall, Rick Osterlo, uh, was afraid that the pixel four, but this is before
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.680]   was released would be panned. He said he did not agree with some of the decisions made
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.160]   about the phone in particular, disappointed with battery life. Google would not let the
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:38.320]   information talk to Rick. Um, so maybe, I don't know, is this a, this might be a change in
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.840]   what the pixel four or the pixel phone going for? Is there a pixel five or no? Maybe there
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.240]   isn't even going to be a pixel five. And Google's really hurt. I mean, the hardware
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.560]   for Google, I feel so bad for these people because they have such good ideas. They have
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:15:00.000]   good software and they throw it out there and it's just, they can't be apple. Shall I
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.720]   wine wine? Did you picture your headbutt or your headbuds? No, no, driving, still disconnecting
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.800]   when you move about disconnecting. It got worse. I did everything. Uh, the server, then,
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.200]   then one side of the bat, there's another other people complaining of discharges and, and the
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.800]   charge suddenly I hardly used it. It was all in its little case plugged in. Still one of
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:28.560]   the things battery ran out. I went back and forth. I went ahead and decided to do an exchange,
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.920]   but I don't know. Because Jason Howell has them and he has not had any of those problems.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.760]   Nope. He emailed me. Oh, no, that yes. He asked him the other day. He said, no, so it
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.840]   must have just started. He was on a phone. He was walking. It's, it's oddly, it's when
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:48.840]   you're in motion and he was walking on a phone call and it didn't. Oh, man, who doesn't walk
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:55.320]   on phone calls? Right. I mean, that's, that's why you're wearing these. That's the point
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.720]   wearing these. So you can walk on the phone call. I have a chosen habit. Have you ever
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.200]   walked too far away from the phone? Cause I forget that the phone is there and I'm going
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:10.240]   and I go outside and go, Hello? Hello? So carry my, just my little tip to all of you,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.040]   carry the phone with you when you go, when you go walking. Um, okay. Well, I'm sorry
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:21.440]   that you're having that problem. I'll let us know if the exchange fixes it. Have you,
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.000]   have you worked out with them? Do you get it with music playback or just when you're talking?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   It works out. Okay. Have you listened to music while walking or do you? I'm just teasing.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.800]   I just, I just, I just, I walk as fast as my old body will take me every evening. That's
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:48.400]   when I use them. And it was true on both audible and music. Okay. That's, thank you.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.880]   And I think it has something to do. So there were, so, so I sent them all kinds of every,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:02.520]   every symptom I can find. I would scratch my nose and a salamu. I would scratch my nose
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.560]   again. Let's try to recreate it. I'm just going to go out five minutes later. I scratched
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:12.200]   my nose. Sam goes up. It's telling you not to touch your face, Jeff. Oh, I know. I'm
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:23.720]   featured. It's a feature. So you're probably then not happy with Google naming these updates
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:30.560]   to the Pixel Buds, the feature drops. Your Pixel Buds are getting audio drops. I mean,
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   the sound drops exactly, but they're going to update these just like they did the Pixel
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.040]   phones with a new capabilities from time to time. I think one capability is to fix the
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:47.280]   fixes. Yeah. Unless it's a hard time. I was, I was ready. I was ready. I was ready. Oh,
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.200]   is that common? But I looked, there's not even though last time we were on, I showed
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.120]   the Reddit thread, which was a lot of problems, but general search on Google is not finding
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.320]   a lot of problems. So I'm hoping this is just a little lemon unit. You got maybe Google's
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:07.360]   censoring the results. I've never had it happen with the Galaxy buds. I've never had
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.720]   it happen with the AirPods, although people have had other problems with the AirPods
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.400]   Pro. I've never had it happen with my job. Those things are amazing. Yeah, I love my,
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.360]   I have two sets of job research. Yeah, I was thinking I might as well get the galaxy
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.120]   to the job because I don't really care about having assistant on it. It's not to be the
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.920]   Google one. We can still get the, you can set up assistant on your job. Yeah. Oh, really.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:34.320]   Okay. And I work out which job you have. I have the 65 T's, but that's what I have the
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:41.760]   elite. The 75s are out. Yeah. And if I, I'm trying to break my 65s so I can get the 75s.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.160]   They're beautiful. They work really well as sound quality is excellent. They're a little
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.720]   pricey. The galaxy buds are cheap. Oh, really? What is the price now on the?
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.680]   I think they're only like 99. Oh, that's great. Yeah. But they're, I love those things.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.360]   Yeah, me too. I have the sport. The sport model as well, which is yeah, they're 99.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.160]   Oh, by the way, sorry. That's a good price. I would get them. Well, the 75 T is 179.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.000]   Yeah, get the 65. They're fine. Yeah. No noise canceling. That's what I have.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.800]   But your pixel buds don't have canceling or do they? No, no. And if you're not using the
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:26.720]   translate, then. Puffa. There is Madame built in. Puffa. That's. Puffa. Puffa. Puffa. That's French
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:37.440]   for Puffa. It's French for Puffa. Puffa. I think I can, can I carry that off? Can I pull it off?
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.960]   No. No, I don't think so. I think it's just Stacy. Yeah. That's Stacy,
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.880]   Automata Pia Stacy Stacy, Autopia. Chabra 65 elite. Let's see if you've got Google on them.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:54.720]   That's the only thing. I think you do. When I tap them, I think I hear a voice.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:03.280]   Yes. If you pull your job or device. Yes. You should be able to get Google Assistant.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.160]   So, so this gets us back to this problem with the people leaving at the pixel group. I wonder if
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.880]   there's hardware problems at Google.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:22.880]   Yes. My 3A is a wonderful thing. I love the 3A and I think that's not how I hope it's not the 4A.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.440]   I'm mad the 4A is not going to have an Excel. That makes me unhappy.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:31.200]   I don't know. I should, I don't know. I know. It's not none of my business.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.080]   How much was the pixel like? What is the goal of the pixel? Let's ask that.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.920]   Well, that has it changed. I think where the, yes. I think that's where the confusion is.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:47.040]   The Nexus line originally was a low cost line of pure Google hardware and software.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.360]   For developers, we thought. And also to demonstrate what pure Android experience could be.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.960]   And then they started to get aspirations when the pixel line came out and they got more and
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.760]   more expensive each year. And people started to say, well, what is, what are you trying to do
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:09.280]   with the pixel line? It is no longer a low cost reference design to show you how great Android
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.320]   could be or for developers to use develop Android apps. It's, you're trying to compete with Apple
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:21.520]   and Samsung. And that's the real problem is Google has not at all kept up with either company.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.640]   Sales wise, product quality wise. The only thing. So you don't think the irony is that these phones
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:34.480]   were as good? I think, I think a lot of features on these phones were, I mean, are comparable to
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:40.400]   Android or sorry, Android, Apple or the Samsung fancy phone. I think the only place it excels is
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.640]   the camera, which is ironic. But that's what people are leaving and it is. That's the most
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:50.960]   important part, isn't it? Google's always had trouble with audio clicking, weirdness, quality
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.080]   issues on all of their pixel phones drop out. A lot of complaints about those battery life is
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.440]   subpar compared to Samsung or Apple. So given that they're charging the same amount as Samsung and
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.520]   Apple charge for their flagship phones, I'm not surprised they're not selling that well.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.680]   It is. I mean, I far prefer to use pure Android than I do Samsung's version of it.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.800]   Oh, yeah. I mean, I will buy an Android phone over a Samsung phone every day of the week just to
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:23.200]   avoid the the bloatware. Yeah, the bloatware and the different way of thinking about the world.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.280]   It's a different. Here you go, Carson. Velt on chowel. Velt on chowel. You also.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.920]   Velt on chowel. Yeah.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:40.560]   You also, which is real view, real view with you also get updates more, I think on time,
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.400]   more and more promptly. I don't know if you get them for longer. And that's the other thing
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:50.080]   Google's done that I think really is cheese to people off, but not nearly as much as people
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.760]   are pissed off about the new Motorola phone, which will get only one update.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:07.120]   Jesus. Whoa. Not bueno. I think that's the Motorola edge, which is a very or the edge plus
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.600]   is a very expensive phone is beautiful. It's great hardware. Oh, wait a minute. Sorry.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:19.120]   I got to take it back. Motorola says, no, we'll do two updates to yeah, two.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:26.160]   So actually, if you do one a year, that's pretty much the same as Google's promising,
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:32.320]   which is two years of updates. Still, I think Andrew has got to do better than that.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.920]   I mean, you could buy an Apple phone and get it updated as long as the phone, you know,
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.960]   is can keep up with the operating system, which is usually quite a few years, four or five years.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.160]   Two years, two years of updates.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.320]   Dose. On yes.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   Those on yes. All right. I can't believe they even said just one year at first.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.280]   Well, you know, props to them for like warning people in advance. Yeah.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.640]   If you buy this, it's only good for a year. Yeah.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.040]   And how do we have any recent data on how long people are keeping their phones now?
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.280]   Because I've got to think more than two years. I think it's, you know,
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.520]   the two years was conditioned by the carriers and the two year contract.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.240]   Because in Canada, where it's typically three years, people were perfectly happy to keep their
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.880]   phone for three years. And given the price of these flagship phones, I don't have a number,
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:33.120]   but I'm going to guess it's more like four years. Yeah. And I would think even now with COVID and
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.440]   all of the economic uncertainty, we're going to see that number.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.280]   Right. Nobody's running out of the store to spend a thousand dollars now.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.920]   Also, not using the phones as much.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.000]   Right. No, they're using their phones a lot.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.760]   Voice minutes are up. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We're starting to see some stats come out over.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.320]   Really? Yeah. Hold on.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:00.160]   Everything. Internet usage, streaming usage. The only one that's not up is Quibi.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.600]   April 15th.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.880]   I'm surprised. Surprise. Surprise.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:16.800]   Jeffrey Gadsenberg said, it's COVID-19's fault. To which I reply, I think COVID-19's your fault.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:24.960]   Anyway, I think there's there's a little truth to that. I mean, it is designed as a commuter service
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.720]   where you're like hanging out. Yeah. A strap hanger though, because if you're driving,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   you're not watching it. It's only for people on the bus or waiting in line at the DMV.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:38.320]   It seems like a small market. Not people that he knows. Yeah. Nobody I know. Yeah.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.880]   And waiting at the dentist's office. I mean, all of that sort of thing in the line at the
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.720]   grocery store, although that's the most anti-social. But Jeff, Wi-Fi calling is up 78 percent in voice
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.240]   calls are up 29 percent. Wow. Wow. Wow. That makes sense. That's a lot. Because you can't talk to
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.200]   me. So you're going to call more. I do a lot of face, a lot more face timing, zooming, all that
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.880]   stuff. But I don't think that would show up on those because I don't usually use my phone for
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.880]   that. But you could. But now, now we're all going to be on meat. Oh, you want to show that?
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.840]   Should we do the meat? Oh, yeah. Let's. So Jeff and I have been sitting here on a meat.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:22.560]   We're going to find it. I got it. You don't have to find it. Just talk. And we have turned on at
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:28.800]   the request of our esteemed colleague, Stacy Higabotham. We have turned on captions to find there at
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:35.440]   the bottom. And Google is using its really good engine to do captioning. And I have to say,
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:41.120]   it's doing a great job. Now, why can't I get this? Yeah, why aren't you? I'm seeing it here.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:49.920]   It spelled my name correctly. It knows Stacy Higabotham. Yeah. It spelled Stacy Higabotham.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.800]   That's correct. Oh, it did. It spelled my name.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.400]   Once you added the Higabotham, because at first it was STACY.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.240]   Yeah. So it knows how you spell it. Well, it must be. I wonder if that's because you're in our
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:11.680]   contact list. Or just Google knows. So we've tried various things like swearing. And it does
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:18.720]   the last risks, if you say bad words. We've also tried German. Lijstung Schutzrecht.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.640]   [Laughter]
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.440]   To which it translated my stomachs with wrecked.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.200]   Velt on Schauung.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.120]   What about a common language? Well, it's on.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.480]   Joan, I kind of like how Germans translated.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.560]   Vowester Bonhof.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:46.560]   Volunteer Bonhof. A new Bonhof, oddly enough. I guess that's used enough in English.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.240]   It's Vowest on sauerkraut piten.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:57.440]   You can't again, survivalist, when sauerkraut Peter.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:03.840]   But if you talk in normal English and even at a normal speed, you don't have to talk slowly,
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.720]   it seems to do a very good job. This is roughly how the Google Voice Assistant works, right?
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.680]   I mean, it's about the same. So my question is.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.920]   And we can talk at the same time too, which is amazing.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.040]   Which is really kind of crazy. I don't know how it knows, but somehow,
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.160]   when Jeff and I both talk at the same time, it gets both of our words.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.840]   No, no one's going to join the call.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:33.440]   But this is so much better than Google Voice. When I still get my voicemails from Google Voice,
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.760]   they are terrible. Why haven't they?
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.480]   Still, really.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.680]   Because the quality of this is so much better than the
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.400]   whole.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:50.720]   Yes, in the caption.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.960]   Short spaghetti for dinner.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.320]   Sell the spaghetti stock.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.760]   Short it.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.040]   Anyway, I think that's pretty cool.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.400]   So we didn't know about this.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.680]   Apparently, it's not a new feature. We just, we never turned on.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.880]   Frankly, we're using zoom.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.080]   Although I have to say, at Twitch, you know, Google does a funny thing,
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.040]   because when we make calendar appointments, which we do a lot for all kinds of stuff,
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.520]   internally and externally, it automatically sets up a meet with a link.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.320]   But you can turn off, but then it comes back on sometimes.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:20.720]   Yes.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.440]   So it's almost like, well, got my lines, well, use it.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.360]   It's actually very clever on their part.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.560]   I've had cases where half the meeting is in Google and half the meeting is in zoom.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.360]   Well, we've had that problem too, because if you want a zoom meeting
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.400]   and you put it in the meeting note, it'll still make a meeting.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.920]   It'll still make a meeting. So an ambassador has to go over to Google land
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.360]   to say, cross the bridge over here to zoomville.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.240]   Isn't that funny?
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.960]   Whoever makes, well, whoever makes the calendar invite has to turn that off.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.360]   So if you're making a difference, people forget to, you know,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.800]   they don't even know what's happening and all of that.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:03.120]   Hey, Jeff had a great interview, by the way, with the Unabomber, Nathan Alabak,
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.880]   who is also, as it turns out, little known, the voice of Steakum.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.440]   No, he just has a very aggressive beard.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.280]   He's a wonderful guy.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.000]   He's a nerd.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   So he was hired as their, well, so he was.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.440]   So he was a marketing company.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.880]   It's a, um, okay.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.520]   Does that look a little fake?
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.120]   The beard?
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.720]   Oh, no, it's he was pulling on it.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:30.960]   Okay.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.440]   So he calls himself a nerd.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:33.920]   He's a nerd.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:40.480]   So, and he's the company, Alabak, has been doing food marketing stuff.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.840]   And like three years ago, Steakums came and said, you know, we're for old people like Jarvis.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.240]   It's been around since the 70s when, you know, people like that,
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.440]   eight cheese takes it home.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:56.080]   And so they, they, he said, let me take over the Twitter account and give it a, you know,
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.440]   kind of a voice that says, gee, even Steakums says that.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.400]   And a voice of pre-sanity.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.440]   This is pre-COVID.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.080]   It's three years ago.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.960]   This is three years.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.360]   So the long comes COVID while every other advertiser is running away.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:09.440]   Right.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.440]   And to hell with them putting no COVID content on their forbidden list,
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.840]   they ran toward it.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:23.920]   And he, you know, has this voice of sanity and reason and science from a frozen meat product.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.440]   He's also extremely honest in the saying, hey, folks, don't forget.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.760]   I'm a marketer trying to sell you frozen meat product.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.080]   It's funny.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.800]   It's ironic.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.120]   And we've talked about it before.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.120]   It's really one of the best brands in, in the face of COVID of anybody.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.480]   So I talked to him about a bunch of stuff, but what I found fascinating,
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.120]   which you guys will like, is that, is that he really understands social community.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:56.160]   He goes in and he figures out, you know, he looks at, at, at, at librarian, Twitter,
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.640]   and media, Twitter and weird Twitter and Stan, tritters of, you know, K-pop.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.080]   And he, and he listens to them and he reads them and he sees what's missing.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.440]   And he knows how to enter in.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.200]   He knows how to have a conversation.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.400]   He listens first.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.680]   The reason I talked to him was because it struck me as instructional for my journalism
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.880]   students and social journalism.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.560]   And he really kind of gets that gospel of listening to people,
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.880]   understanding with them, empathizing with them.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.480]   One of the interesting things about him is that he also, his name is out there.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.440]   Nathan Alabach and his Twitter account is out there.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.240]   So he can't really be himself because people are going to say,
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.120]   "Oh, that's the steak guy."
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.320]   He's now steak comes.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.920]   It's just like the Comcast guy, Comcast Frank.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.360]   Comcast Frank.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.240]   He kind of made it hard for him.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.600]   But he, okay, I got a question.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.640]   So in the days of Comcast, Frank, Frank really did very well for Comcast by making them
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.840]   appear to be responsive to customer issues.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.400]   Yes.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:50.800]   To play.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.480]   Something they've just given up.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.160]   But it was a moment in time when it really worked well.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.520]   He was brilliant at it.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.720]   Fast forward though.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.360]   Does it matter if a brand is on Twitter these days?
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.240]   There's some ancillary coverage you get, but most people, normal people,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.120]   aren't on Twitter.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.400]   And even if you are on Twitter, no matter what tweet, it goes by, right?
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.040]   It's not.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.920]   You have to be there at the time.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.200]   Oh, I'm going to disagree.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.240]   Look at another brand.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.000]   Look at what, um, Taco Bell.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:22.880]   My favorite.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.080]   Yeah, but I'm on Twitter and I don't see Taco Bell because I don't.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.560]   But it doesn't matter because your friends will talk about it or the cool,
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.120]   you're not the cool kids, but the cool kids will talk about it.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.400]   There's now a Taco Bell literary magazine.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.680]   Do we tell you about that?
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.720]   I think it's irrelevant.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:36.960]   No.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.320]   I think Taco Bell, when I think it's Taco Bell quarterly,
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.880]   I think you're interested because you're interested in Taco Bell.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.200]   They made it as new customers.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.480]   Taco Bell quarterly.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.240]   Go there's, do we read this last week?
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:50.560]   No.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.440]   Did we do this?
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:51.920]   No.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.640]   Go there.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.800]   Taco Bell quarterly.org.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.160]   It has nothing to do with Taco Bell.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.120]   This is fan fiction, right?
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.760]   This is people came up so volume two has Taco Bell poetry and fiction.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.000]   So this is fantastic.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.200]   Oh my God, Jeff, this is where we can write our queso like.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.400]   Exactly.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.040]   The queso reader requiem.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.960]   Eating you, your voice rings by heart.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.880]   A language turned into light waves traveling into the pace to crack one's soul.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.160]   It is pretty crappy.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.000]   And spitting at times and swallowing and brushing my bristle chin,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   the light now flamenco's mirror to mirror until it becomes noise again,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   bending and loud and rhythmless.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.280]   Okay, well, never mind.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:38.480]   So all of this stuff with standing does it sell more tacos?
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.040]   Gages the people who like you.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.720]   I mean, that brands love this stuff.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.640]   That's pretty, okay, that's pretty obvious.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.920]   And beautiful.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.840]   If you're already a fan, then you're following Taco Bell or Steakum or whatever.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.320]   And so you can talk about this and blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.840]   I just don't think it's it's when I come along out of nowhere and I retweet Steakum.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.440]   So somebody says, what the age?
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.280]   I've never, what is what's what's going on?
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.720]   They discover Steakums too.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.040]   Then they have to go to the store and buy Steakum.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:09.440]   Yes.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.880]   I have tons of friends because they want to reward him because it's so good.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.080]   Who are buying.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.400]   Now, the problem here is that I would kill for it.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.040]   My wife, like you doesn't like your wife doesn't let you go to the store
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.480]   and she doesn't want me to have Steakums.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.760]   So I can't get me Steakums.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.840]   There's better, like me better meat.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.080]   If you're going to get.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.720]   I want it.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.280]   I want it.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:29.680]   I want it.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.640]   That's why I want steak.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.160]   No provolone and grilled onions on a roll.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.160]   That and Taco Bell are the two things I miss.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.000]   Okay.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.600]   Badly.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.240]   All right.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:42.800]   I will.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.360]   You know what?
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.560]   Speaking of provolone.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:44.880]   Yes.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.040]   We are having meatball, pennies tonight and they're going to be delicious.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.480]   Are you homemade or are you going to get them out from the?
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.920]   No, no, I don't make meatballs.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.080]   They're local Bainbridge meatball vendor.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.160]   Oh, that would be nice.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.040]   No, I have.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.640]   I always keep meatballs in the freezer.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.160]   Ah, our son for unaccountably has suddenly got a Jones for meatloaf.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.480]   That's great.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.080]   Meatloaf is the easiest thing in the world.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:10.880]   Okay.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:11.920]   Look for food.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.200]   Do you put a ketchup on top?
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.160]   Oh, yeah, you got it.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:14.560]   Right?
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.040]   After.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.320]   I put a one steak sauce on mine.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.040]   It's delicious.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.240]   Oh, you fancy meatloaf.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.120]   Oh, that's fancy.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.200]   You're going to make me love.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.240]   That's French meatloaf.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.440]   So, okay.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.240]   Okay.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:32.000]   I just was curious because it's actually an internal conversation we have.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.160]   We have a very good, very active social media presence on Twitter.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.760]   We have Jerry Misako.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.800]   They do a great job.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.640]   But I feel like that's nice.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.400]   And I guess it's.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.840]   But there's a difference Leo.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.080]   What your social media presence does is promote what you already have.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.480]   Right.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:56.560]   What what Stackems does is create a persona and a voice.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.880]   And an empathy with people, and irony and humor and intelligence.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.840]   Right.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.760]   And and Taco Bell is different, but it's very similar.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.920]   It created so the Taco Bell was not cool.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.960]   It was it was ridiculed.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.160]   Now Taco Bell is cool.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:12.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.240]   I'm always cool.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.880]   Taco Bell is always part of your drunk eating.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.320]   I got ready to.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:18.720]   Maybe.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.200]   Thank you.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.600]   Cool.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.000]   That is.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.480]   It may be a Texas, but I got ridiculed forever.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.560]   That's because you're a grown man.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.400]   Let's get your grown man.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.880]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.640]   If you are eight years old,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.360]   I understand.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.760]   I know, but it's for.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.720]   My college kids in high school kids.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.160]   That's what Taco Bell's for.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.400]   I want to be young again.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.160]   You want to be a little.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:46.960]   That's also what makes it cool.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.360]   Let me.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.120]   I mean, you could be young, Jeff, if you want to.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.640]   Turn back.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.360]   I mean, it's the cost of one.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.800]   Alan back.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.280]   Tweeting is less than one ad on a network.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.320]   Tell that was your show.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.200]   One story I read said they basically go through their budget.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   And they said, what am I going to do?
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.400]   And Alan back said, I hate.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.600]   Why do I try this?
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.360]   And they didn't expect.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.160]   I mean, they didn't go into this thinking this is going to turn viral.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.320]   But boom, one day and it did.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.840]   And and Stachem says happy.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.080]   Well, I asked him too about the relationship with the brand because I said,
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.040]   they got to be nervous sometimes.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.720]   They said, yeah, you know, there are things that go on the.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.160]   Maybe you don't want to do that again, the list.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.520]   But generally he spent three years developing trust with the brand,
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.840]   with his client, and also developing trust between the brand and the public.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.840]   And so it's kind of brilliant.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.760]   He's just a nice guy.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.720]   He's a musician, songwriter who decided what he got married.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.240]   He said, I got to have a job.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:52.960]   Good for him.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.720]   So he's not.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.520]   And he is thick of him.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.880]   He has done the thing that you really want to do, which is his creative voice.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.480]   He really has.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.440]   He's also on Twitch.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.440]   By the way, he's a gamer.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.320]   What does he stream?
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.680]   I don't know.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.960]   Can you can you look him up?
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.440]   No, no, he does not.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.000]   He can be.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.760]   No, he games.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:17.040]   Well, I guess maybe, well, if you go to his, if you go to Nathan Alabak's Twitter account,
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.600]   you'll see his his.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:25.440]   So it's Twitter slash Nathan Alabak.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.560]   He he was last live 16 hours ago.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:35.840]   And what does he do?
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:41.040]   The history of media polarization and prominent political identities.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.960]   So I guess he just comes on and talks.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.440]   Yeah, he's he's he's been a, um,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.640]   on a didact called himself.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.760]   Yeah, you call himself a nerd.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.880]   So he just works.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.240]   He is a great dog.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.000]   He is a great dog.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.120]   He he he he he does.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.400]   No, that's not a great dog that somebody else.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.280]   That's another person.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.200]   No, there's a dog.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.080]   Do you not see the dog?
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.640]   Oh, yeah, there's the dog.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.720]   I thought that was an alpha.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.600]   He fosters dogs.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.360]   Um, he's a good guy.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.200]   So let's say, no, no, I'm not knocking him.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.000]   No, no, you're not.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.240]   I know.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:10.640]   God bless you.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.160]   I just like the guy a lot.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.960]   Here's your here's your dog moment for you.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.400]   Stacey.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.280]   Wow.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.120]   Puppies.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.200]   Okay, that's a guy to love.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:21.680]   Yes.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.880]   Puppies.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.080]   Oh, more puppies.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.240]   Puppy content's always good on twist.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.680]   Oh, that's the best.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.520]   Look at that.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.000]   Love that.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.640]   Peek dogs.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.440]   Look at that tail.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.520]   Guys, he's so easy.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.320]   I see that.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.240]   Okay, this is not at all Google related,
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.760]   and we probably should get back on task.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.160]   Never mind.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.360]   I'm not going to digress.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.960]   Let's play.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:42.960]   You can play.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.440]   Here's my dog.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.400]   Take him's.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.120]   Let's talk.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:45.840]   Oh, there's your dog.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.240]   Where's your dog?
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.480]   You're like you like Lamar Alexander's, Stacey.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.480]   Did you see that?
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.200]   He likes take him down.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.000]   In the hearing,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.520]   he was off to the side of the screen,
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.640]   just like Stacey,
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.480]   so that you could see his dog behind
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.840]   and think more highly of him.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.000]   That's pretty disgusting.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.760]   I think it was just the poor pooch.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.560]   My dog is exhausted.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.760]   I'm exploiting her so much.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.400]   She's just back there sleeping.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.320]   Siva Vaigenathan.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.640]   Article and Wired.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.720]   Talking about the Facebook regulatory,
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.880]   or I guess not really regulatory,
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.000]   and that's part of his problem.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.640]   Self-regulatory.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.040]   Self-regulatory.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.000]   Well, even that.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Their review board,
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.360]   Facebook and the folly of self-regulation,
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.000]   the company's new review board is designed
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.360]   to move slowly and keep things intact,
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.000]   to play on the Facebook slogan of move
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.680]   quickly and break things.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.040]   I'm sure you've read this.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.360]   Yes, I love Siva.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.160]   We do now.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:46.720]   Siva's good.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:46.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.880]   And we do now know who's on the board.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.120]   And it's a very prestigious board of people.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:53.440]   Indeed.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:59.200]   His, I think his contention is that they have no power.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.040]   He makes some good points,
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.200]   but we don't know until they start going.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.440]   I think what we're going to see from that kind of board
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.600]   is they might surprise us and come out with pronouncements.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.080]   They'll ignore the rules from Facebook.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:16.000]   He says this review board will provide a creaking,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.320]   idealistic, simplistic solution to a trivial problem.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.760]   The stuff that Facebook deletes creates an inconvenience
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.920]   to some people, Facebook makes a lot of mistakes
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.600]   in dealing with the Facebook bureaucracy
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.920]   is next to impossible.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.600]   But Facebook is not the whole internet,
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.360]   let alone the whole information ecosystem,
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.800]   and Facebook is not the only way people
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.160]   can communicate and learn things.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.360]   True that.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.080]   Although, you know, and you would agree with that, right?
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.520]   I mean, we're putting a lot of responsibility on Facebook.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.880]   They're just part of the problem.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.720]   Although having come back to Facebook,
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:52.480]   I can see how easy it is to get channeled into a stream
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.520]   of stuff you believe.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.480]   Very easy to do.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.440]   He also says the problem with the review board is
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.480]   Facebook hasn't given them the power
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.320]   they would need to really change.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.960]   But again, that's where I think we got to see what they do,
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.480]   because what they're going to do is they're going to take
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.080]   they've said this, you know, in the press conference that I listened on,
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.480]   they're going to choose cases that speak more loudly.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:18.720]   Right.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.840]   I mean, I don't imagine the former prime minister of Denmark
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.000]   and the former editor of The Guardian sitting down,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.280]   well, is the should she have said that that makeup was bad or not?
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.600]   That's not what they're doing.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.560]   That's not what they're doing.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.720]   They're going to do things that speak to principles.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.320]   Right. Well, yeah, one hopes.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.160]   And many things will say.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.800]   We'll just ignore them, but at least it will raise an important issue.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.240]   Well, then it's transparent.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:44.480]   Right.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.680]   Then we can all judge them and they will judge.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.160]   I don't think we can know either way.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   I think Siva's good points were about diversity, which they know.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.800]   But you know, you have one person from India
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.960]   to understand all the culture of India, his heart.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.960]   The last line is the problem with Facebook is Facebook.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.680]   He doesn't like Facebook.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.720]   Well, this is Siva's argument.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.960]   This is where he and I fundamentally disagree.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.720]   He thinks that connecting mankind is bound to be a disaster.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.680]   And I think the opposite.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.880]   I don't know if he would say it that way, would he?
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.480]   He kind of does.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.560]   He kind of just says it's just a bad idea.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:26.640]   It poses some intransigent problems.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:32.720]   The funny thing about Siva is he's probably the best person I know at Facebook.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.080]   Isn't that funny?
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.360]   His Facebook feed is brilliant.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.480]   His Twitter feed is brilliant.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:42.800]   He's really good at social media, even as he decries its mere existence.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   Well, maybe he's maybe more aware of it because he's doing all he can to make it a good stream
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   of stuff. And it ends up being crap anyway.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.000]   No, he's just too smart.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.520]   He can't help himself for being smart.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.160]   That's Siva.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.680]   Well, we'll watch.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.200]   I mean, we will.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.440]   The board is complete now.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.800]   When does it not?
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.600]   No, it's not.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.520]   It's 20 people.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.520]   And then those 20 people will choose the next 20 to make up 40.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.320]   Got it.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.960]   And they will operate in five person categories.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.880]   Yes, right.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.760]   And the board itself has views of the diversity.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:23.440]   And so they're going to battle that out and figure out who needs to be there, who's missing.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:30.480]   They're going to go through some training and bonding.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.640]   And they have to guys, they mentioned the last show, they have to get equipment
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:41.280]   to get access to Facebook's own moderation systems.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.120]   So it'll be a while.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.800]   People in a few months.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.720]   Yeah, because you know, you can't do ropes courses right now with COVID.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.880]   No corporate bonding right now.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.480]   Right.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.440]   And that's a god.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.480]   I hate that stuff.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.200]   Oh, I did.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:57.520]   Jesus.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.440]   Hey, you know what?
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.240]   I in high school.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.800]   Oh, I was going to tell you about my secret ropes course history.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.280]   Yeah, please.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.080]   Oh, no, do it.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.520]   I worked with kids who were dangerous failing.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.280]   And we did ropes courses with them.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.480]   I was one of the trades.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.080]   Or that I would have a bit of you.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.760]   Yeah, you would have to do what I would have said.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.320]   Yes, ma'am.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.920]   No, I think that's good.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.280]   I think that that actually works really well with high school kids.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.840]   A little less that we business executives, but definitely works well with high school kids.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.640]   You know what I hate?
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.640]   Icebreaker.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.840]   A lot of things.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.720]   Icebreakers.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.280]   Icebreakers.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.960]   I despise icebreakers.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.000]   I want to run away until the freaking icebreaker is over.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.280]   This is pretty much what I believe in my ice frozen for you.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.360]   I freeze harder.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.600]   If you have to tell us what you mean by icebreakers.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.280]   Why don't we all say, um,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.120]   a little bit about favorite game as a child.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.080]   Tells me nothing about you.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.040]   I didn't have favorite games as children as a child.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.480]   I feel inadequate from the start of whatever meeting you're having.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.080]   And I really start to dislike everyone in the meeting.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.440]   Oh, God, I love it.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.280]   It's like going to a...
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.040]   Don't break my ice.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.960]   My two-and-a-dara-thick Parker or something.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.600]   That's awesome.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.360]   Okay.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:17.600]   Okay.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.280]   We should go back to Google, you guys, because we have lots of actual Google questions.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:21.680]   There's lots of news.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.560]   Lots of news.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.520]   What are you talking about?
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.320]   What are you talking about?
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:24.480]   Yes.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:24.880]   Go ahead.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:25.360]   You start.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.680]   Sidewalk is done.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.960]   Folded.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.560]   As of Thursday.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.520]   Exits Toronto.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.840]   They exited Toronto.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.680]   Did they fold sidewalk?
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:35.840]   No.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.120]   Okay.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.120]   They just gave up on sidewalk in Toronto.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.120]   They just gave up on sidewalk in Toronto.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.640]   So this was the very...
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.800]   You know, when you look at the picture of it,
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.440]   it's a relatively small development on the key sign in Toronto,
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.280]   which is right now just a warehouse district.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.560]   It encompasses a few apartment buildings and stuff,
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.520]   but it's all censored, lots of cameras and stuff.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.880]   And the idea is a model city, and in this case,
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.800]   really just a model neighborhood based on big data.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.320]   The city of Toronto wanted to do it.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.080]   Google Sidewalk, which is an alphabet company,
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.040]   has the technology to do it.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.680]   The people of Toronto, at least some of the people of Toronto.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.680]   Well, the media of Toronto hated it.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.600]   And Laurel Pennick.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.480]   Okay.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.440]   No, no, no, stop.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.640]   Google, in its typical googly fashion, went out and said,
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.720]   "We have this great big plan.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.640]   We're going to change the world.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.440]   Trust us."
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.560]   And people said, "I am a citizen, and I have input here,
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.440]   so I'm going to use that input and ask you a lot of questions."
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.320]   And Google said, "We're going to do something basic.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.040]   Trust us."
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:50.240]   They actually put out a multi-thousand page answer
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.200]   to these questions that didn't answer any of them.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.440]   So I'm going to say that Google shot itself in the footage.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.400]   Well, we're both right.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.480]   I think Toronto shot itself in the footage,
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.400]   because they got all nasty about it.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.560]   And oh my god, the big horrible company is going to do horrible things.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.000]   I don't think so.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.120]   And I think they were both wrong.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.400]   I think they were both way wrong.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.760]   And they've lost an opportunity.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.280]   They've both lost an opportunity.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.080]   But you know what?
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.200]   This is like the Amazon Extra Headquarters.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.440]   You come to Newark, Google.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.960]   It's right next door to New York.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.760]   They need you.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.440]   You could do amazing things in the city.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.880]   So much time, this is the parcel, by the way,
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:25.840]   that they were going to develop,
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.000]   which is really just wasted space.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.680]   But they were also...
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.720]   Could have been really beautiful.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.080]   And look, you have other developers vying.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:39.760]   Toronto's skyline is laced with horrific condominium complexes.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.400]   Oh, god, yes.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.240]   That were overbuilt in the last 20 years.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.440]   This would have been a timber-based skyscraper.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.920]   It was a very interesting project.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.520]   But it also included another parcel,
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.200]   I think a 50-acre parcel,
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   then the city was giving up just to Google.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.040]   So there was a lot about this that was
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.480]   not fully explained well.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.280]   And I will say,
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.200]   here's what I'm going to say about both of these things.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.280]   And Jeff, even your comments about Morl Panic.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:13.280]   I think Morl Panic is something,
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.680]   if you want to call it Morl Panic,
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.240]   we have to address this.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.600]   And companies have to...
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.520]   Tech companies have to be a little less arrogant.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.000]   And they have to be willing to do the work.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.160]   Every other company,
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.160]   like if you talk to a construction firm.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.200]   It's hard.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.160]   It's hard.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.480]   You've got to get by a lot of roadblocks.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.520]   Well, but often,
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.040]   yeah, I agree with you Stacy.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.320]   I absolutely agree with you.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:42.880]   But let's also see the process of development locally is often corrupt.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.880]   And it's a game.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.120]   And it's played by people like Jared Kushner.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.760]   And we see the fruits of it.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:55.040]   So I think that if Google wanted to accomplish something,
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:55.760]   I repeat,
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.800]   I love Toronto dearly.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.640]   It's about the other place I'd want to live.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.640]   New York, Berlin, Toronto, my favorite cities.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.400]   I think it's a great place.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.560]   But Google should have picked some place that really could have used them.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.280]   And they could have collaborated with the city better
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.440]   and done something in a place like Newark or Camden or Trenton.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.000]   God, can't...
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.360]   And it could have made a huge difference.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.160]   Yeah, okay.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.480]   And what's weird to me is Google did such a good job with Google fiber,
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.200]   if you remember, with working with the communities.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.040]   Up until they started actually digging up people's lawns,
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.720]   which everyone's going to get pissed about.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.720]   So it was kind of surprising that...
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.760]   I just don't think...
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.280]   And this gets to...
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.320]   Like I wrote about this.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:45.280]   I think this gets to one of the core problems with smart city efforts is
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.160]   we don't actually know what we're buying and selling here.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.760]   And I think when you do civic infrastructure,
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.280]   you have to be very clear on what you're offering people
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.360]   and the value of that because...
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:02.640]   My God, like we're democracies, right?
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.840]   And you have to sell people on the idea.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.200]   I don't...
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.400]   Here's the interesting things, Stacy.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.560]   Post-COVID, we don't know what cities are going to be.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.800]   And I'm very worried for New York.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.000]   I'm very worried for every city,
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.280]   especially cities with public transit and the things that we need in a society.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.000]   And so what does a smart city look like then with the kind of data we could have,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.680]   things that can protect people's lives around data, privacy,
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.400]   clacksons going off, certainly.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.560]   Well, no, one of the things that Google was so problematic with is they didn't talk about
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.520]   how the city could access and use the data.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.800]   That was one of the big complaints is Google was going to have all this data,
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.560]   but they didn't want to make all of it available to cities.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.360]   And they were very...
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.200]   They were also scared of saying, "Uh-oh, Google's handing over data to the city."
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.120]   So it was a delicate dance.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.560]   I don't think...
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.680]   I'm not disagreeing with you.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.640]   I'm not disagreeing with you that they didn't do enough to say,
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.560]   "Here's what can benefit you, Toronto."
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.200]   But they get smashed on the other side of their head.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.120]   "Oh my God, they got data."
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.760]   So the more they talk about data, the worse off, so they get allergic to that.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:12.160]   But I'm agreeing with you, Stacy.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:12.960]   I'm agreeing with you.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.160]   They could have done a much better job.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.080]   Toronto could have done another job too.
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:16.080]   Yeah, Google's...
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:16.080]   Yeah, Google's...
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:21.120]   Yeah, I don't get why Google is so terrible about communicating.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.320]   I mean, they're terrible about communicating on every level.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.160]   It's probably an arrogance.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.440]   It is difficult to do this kind of development.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:33.360]   Every time this happens in any city, and I've seen it here in Petaluma,
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.240]   on a much smaller scale, the developer is...
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:41.920]   There's a constant push and pull from the developer and very civic entities,
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:45.040]   not just the city government, but locals and so forth.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.000]   I mean, we're so far from it.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.160]   I don't know what the real issues were.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.360]   Maybe Google was asking too much money from Toronto.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.360]   Maybe the issue was Toronto wanted data.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.320]   Google didn't know the issue.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.560]   No, the issue was that Google, when they proposed this,
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:05.040]   they had the Keyside project, but then they also had a whole plan for another
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.360]   development that wasn't part of that project.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.960]   That the city was also giving to them.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.840]   And then there were also issues about data usage.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.640]   All of that's negotiable at some point, right?
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.600]   I mean, I wouldn't as well...
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.520]   Google wasn't willing to negotiate on it,
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.080]   and they weren't talking about what they were going to do with it.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.480]   So it was kind of like Amazon walking away from New York saying,
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.360]   "Well, fine, okay, you don't want it too bad."
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.880]   I think it's good.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:28.880]   I think it's good.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.720]   It was a little bit of take my ball and go home.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.880]   But I ask, "Hey, maybe a little bit."
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:39.120]   I do think that they realize that this is a stupid thing to pursue
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:44.560]   in the wake of sheer economic catastrophe,
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.080]   which is where we're heading.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.080]   And city catastrophe too.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.600]   And city catastrophe.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.760]   I mean, how do you get from that complex?
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.120]   How do you get to your job?
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.640]   Subway.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.000]   And you have to go with distance to get to the subway.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:03.360]   It's just I'm looking at this parcel.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:09.520]   And it's not a particularly attractive part of Toronto.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.120]   It's a part that really could use some redevelopment.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.360]   It seems as if it would have been nice if they could have.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:19.440]   Figured out a way to do it.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:23.120]   And I love, you know, I think it's going to take some of these
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.480]   some of these tech companies to step up and say,
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.200]   "Let's try some different ways to do our cities.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.400]   Let's plan some different ways."
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:36.880]   This is the full 800-hecter designated waterfront area.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.320]   The key side part was just that red part.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.840]   But the purple is, of course, the whole eastern waterfront.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:47.200]   And I don't know how much of that they were proposing.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.440]   So now we have, as we talked about last week, Eric Schmidt,
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:55.200]   brought in by Cuomo to rethink technology and local government.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:55.520]   Right.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:57.680]   It is an opportunity and a need.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.560]   The Stacey's primary point is right.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.760]   The arrogance is a problem.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.680]   But we should be figuring this stuff out together now.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.400]   I don't know if we will.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.320]   But we'll see.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.440]   It's not just arrogance.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:18.640]   It's also a willingness to tell people what the concrete value is.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.680]   And I'm going to say tech is really bad at this because,
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.240]   actually, tech broadly is bad at this.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.000]   Companies like Apple are very good.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.960]   And I'm not a huge Apple fan by any stretch.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.440]   But they do a good job of explaining how a brand new chip
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.600]   or a brand new technology is going to just change your world in an amazing way.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:45.200]   And I think tech companies tend to either over-promise on that and not deliver.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.640]   Or they just say, "Woo, magical chip or magical radio protocol."
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.360]   And they're like, "You should get excited because they're excited."
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.160]   And they'll be like, "It can do all these things."
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:01.040]   But they don't deliver it to people in a package that most people can consume it.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:01.680]   And I think--
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:07.280]   And you've really got to do that.
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:07.920]   If you're going to--
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.200]   And not just smart cities.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:09.680]   I think it's--
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:15.520]   If you're thinking about reimagining cities and you're bringing technology into play,
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.960]   there are a lot of really amazing technologies out there.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:27.360]   But it's really hard to say that none of those are actually deliverable yet in a package.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.000]   They're actually something you need systems, integrators.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.920]   You need a lot of help to pull together.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:36.560]   And I think that's going to be really tough to communicate and build
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.160]   because it's such a fragmented--
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.480]   It's also a human center design thinking is,
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.640]   "We'll try it once, then we'll see, and then we'll iterate,
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.840]   then we'll try and then we'll iterate," which is the way the role does operate.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.280]   But they don't toughen in that sense.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:58.480]   I would love to hear from somebody on the other side who can explain what was wrong with this.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.920]   Bianca Wiley.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:00.720]   Okay.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.560]   I'm reading the master plan.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.600]   It sounds like at least they were trying to listen.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.160]   They did a lot.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.120]   I would have liked to live there.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:12.800]   That's probably really where it comes down to for me is, that's cool.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.680]   I want to be there.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.240]   Beats living in Disney.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.440]   I don't want to live in celebration of Florida.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.320]   Right, exactly.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:24.960]   But this looked pretty cool and interesting.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:29.120]   As I said, it's an improvement over the way it is right now.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.800]   And I know that area.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.160]   I've spent some time there.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:38.720]   But I would be very curious to know what it may, and it may purely have been COVID.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:39.840]   That's what they said it was.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:44.240]   It's just the economic climate is not right to build all of this right now,
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.000]   especially if there's pushback from the city.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.120]   But it seems like they were making some progress.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.800]   I know it's easy to say, "Oh, it's privacy advocates tank this."
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.080]   And I don't know if that's the case.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:54.720]   I really don't.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.960]   It was not a happy end.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.640]   It was not a happy marriage.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.360]   There was a lot of back and forth.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:05.920]   But I can tell you, every single development, we got a development going on in Petaluma right now.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.360]   People don't want it.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:12.000]   It's going to add another stop to the train, the smart train, which people also don't want,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   but it takes a lot of cars off the road.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.280]   There's this is normal.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.280]   This is the back and forth that goes on.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.640]   Back and forth local level.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:19.200]   As it should.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:19.840]   As it should.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:23.680]   So I don't, I certainly don't know what happened.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.760]   Maybe you want to do a whole piece on it.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.280]   Think piece on it, Stacey, for GIGO.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.000]   For my newsletter?
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.000]   I know a lot of work at GIGO.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.800]   I haven't for five years.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.640]   This is why we need journalism.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.560]   Yes.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:44.080]   No, I wrote actually extensively about it during the fighting.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:44.960]   Oh good.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.560]   And I had people on the show to talk about it.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:46.960]   Oh good.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.000]   So you do know a lot about it.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.440]   Is it at all a loss to Toronto that's not going to happen now?
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.040]   I mean, yes.
[00:59:55.040 --> 01:00:00.000]   It's I think it's a loss because I do think there were good things about it.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.640]   I think it could have been a really interesting project.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.800]   Like it would have been good to build something like this.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.880]   I think that.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:15.760]   I think that Google probably could have done a better job explaining some of that and
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:20.560]   acknowledging what it was going to do with the data and answering some of these questions, I guess.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:20.880]   Right.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.120]   But you know what too?
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:29.440]   I think that if they tried this five years ago, it would have gone through a lot smoother.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.360]   Yes.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.400]   But I think that's because we've started learning about how.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:40.960]   I'm also going to say it's also because in the meantime we've had moral panic.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:48.880]   No, I think there's a very legitimate case for saying, hey, we're letting these companies have
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.440]   a lot of data and they're using it in very, they're sometimes using it in ways that are not
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.640]   comfortable for us. And we're also seeing how when you start building AI based on this sort of data,
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.560]   there's no accountability for things like redlining or other things that.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.200]   And this is a really important point.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.240]   Cities and governments, their job is to protect those who have,
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.160]   who are who are most injured by our society, right?
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.120]   They're the last, they're the safety net, they're the last stop, right?
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:26.000]   And if you look at it that way, they have a very different goal than a private company does.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.800]   And sometimes those things are in conflict and I don't think there's ways to resolve some of them.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:37.920]   What I'm saying Stacey too is that the atmosphere now about tech, we're in the tech
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.160]   lash, it's very negative. I think that has to factor in. So it's politically, especially in
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:48.160]   places like Canada, which I remember I love, but they tend to be, you know, European, they're more
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.640]   European than American by a long shot. Robertson Davies always said that Canada is actually Scandinavia.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.480]   And I love Scandinavia. Exactly. I love Canada and I love Scandinavia.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.320]   But they have a different cultural view and there's more skepticism. It's another story in the
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:10.320]   rundown. And this is probably another example of not doing it right. I've argued, part of what
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.360]   the platforms have to do too is start to defend the internet and defend the freedoms that are
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.080]   there. And I'm scared of what's going to happen, right? So what does Facebook do? Facebook is starting a
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.480]   one report said dark money. I think it's a little strong, but an effort to kind of boost tech.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:32.720]   I'm not sure that's the way to do it. This is that new, is it a political action committee or
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.720]   just a lobbying group? The edge? It's, it's, I can't tell if it's purely lobbying and it gets
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:45.840]   obviously part of it. It's called a American edge. And the idea dark money merely means you don't
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:51.840]   you don't know who's donating to it, right? It's a non profit. But let me know what's Facebook.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:59.680]   It's Facebook. They can raise money, blitz the airwaves with ads without the obligation of disclosing
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:05.920]   all their donors. They call it a kind of like a social welfare group American edge.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.440]   Facebook says the US leads the world in technology. We should be proud of that fact and promote it.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.760]   We're working with a diverse group of stakeholders to help build support for our industry while
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.720]   we're leading an effort to start this coalition. Now's a good time because I think people are a
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.840]   little bit more positive about technology. Yeah, I think it is. But it also just to Stacy's point,
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.080]   I mean, I think what you're saying is behave better and maybe it'll get better. And I think the
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:36.080]   example of that is Amazon, right? Amazon should have an aggressive structure to treat its employees
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:42.240]   better. They're going to pay two dollars an hour more. Yeah, I know. But only to the end of the month.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.640]   I like Amazon and I use Amazon and but but they could be doing better.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:52.480]   By the way, deliveries according to Amazon will be returning to normal.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:04:02.640]   Yeah. Pretty amazing. I'm a little missed because I bought my mama Kindle paper white and it only
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.040]   was delivered today. Yeah, it takes a while. Well, she got it today. How long are they order?
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:14.720]   I ordered it on Saturday and I paid more money. They put it on sale on Monday.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:23.440]   I ordered a damn miracle that lets you read on on a device that gets across the country and
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:32.240]   out of nowhere. And it took three days. How dare they? I ordered it Saturday the second for delivery
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.280]   on Mother's Day the 10th. Oh, that makes sense. You want it on Mother's Day? I understand. All
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.080]   right. All right. All right. You win. All right. It's my mom. Yeah. Well, she got it a couple of
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.480]   days at the Mother's Day. I'm sure she was very happy, right? That's actually a really nice Kindle.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:52.080]   I love this. Yeah. Well, hers it. She was on the second generation Kindle with the keys and everything.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:57.680]   And she was telling me she's like, it's not broken. It's just, you know, I have to charge the battery
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:05.920]   after like an hour. Those are moms. It works fine, honey. Amazon took a second. I don't want anything
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:11.200]   new. My mom's like, oh, no, she learns new things all the time. She actually is an active.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:17.200]   Oh, yes. She watches the show. Yeah. She's, but she refused to give up her iPhone 6.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:21.840]   Yeah. My mom, she's, she was raised by depression, her parents. That was her thing.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.800]   I think that's part of it. Yep. Yep. And you know what? Our kids are going to say,
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:32.640]   I was raised by COVID-era parents. That's why I washed my hands 10 times a day and can still wear a mask.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:43.920]   Amazon said they hired 175,000 people. It took several weeks. Wow. It's kind of amazing.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:49.600]   That is unbelievable. Yeah. It's kind of amazing. The scale that Amazon operates at.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.240]   So they say, according to a Time magazine, it's back to normal or we'll be back to normal.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:03.040]   We were overwhelmed in April. Many shoppers saw long delivery times and shifted their purchases
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:09.600]   to pick up curbside options offered by Walmart and Target. This is according to the chief executive
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:16.800]   of Price Spider. I tried, but Walmart and Target seem to have the same long lengthy weights.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:23.120]   Still can't get disinfecting wipes anywhere. Oh, God, no. Oh, well, that, I mean, Amazon's
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.000]   not magic. I don't know if they're going to be able to get you disinfecting wipes.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:37.840]   No, I'm running low. Amazon did announce a new $90 Amazon fire tablet, the fire HD 8.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:49.760]   $89.99. Wow. Pretty amazing. Yeah. 32 gigs of storage. The Fire 8 Plus has more RAM,
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:56.320]   six month subscription to Kindle Unlimited. That's a 109.99. They start shipping June 3rd,
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.760]   which means you should be able to get them in time for Mother's Day next year.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:05.680]   Or Father's Day. Or Father. Actually, that's right. That's right. That's right.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:11.280]   I think though, I know, Aces is better for reading than a Kindle because it's paper.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.960]   Well, Father's Day is the 21st. Y'all have time. You got time. You got time. Order now.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:22.240]   Amazon, one of the big winners in streaming, by the way, the number one is Netflix clearly.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.880]   Then Amazon, an average household minutes for the month. This is according to Seven Park,
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:32.400]   which tracks this stuff. Beating Disney and other big media companies.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:38.560]   Is it the fact, you know, is it the shows? I don't know. I think it's everybody who has
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.160]   Prime automatically gets it. And if you haven't looked at it when you're a teacher, like,
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.840]   I'll look at it. I'll watch. I'll watch. Yeah. I'll do. I had that. Oh, cool. Yeah. And we've
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:51.520]   been watching. We started the Lindberg show based on the Philip Roth novel. That's.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:08:01.040]   Is it scary? It's not scary. It's just that it's an alternate history in which Lindberg beat
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:08.720]   Roosevelt to become president in 1940. It could happen here. Yeah, it's a little maybe too close
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:15.600]   to home. And then, yeah, America first, right? That was Lindberg's slogan. That's pretty good.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:20.400]   Bosch is pretty good. I don't know. There's a load. I just started that. Isn't that
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:25.760]   interesting? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Did we discuss on Netflix? Did you do Berlin,
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:31.520]   Babylon, Berlin? I love Babylon, Berlin. I started it. Try to watch the new season. It's hard.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:37.600]   I don't know why, but I'm just. I need I need lighter and lighter fare for now. What we do in
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:44.560]   the shadows. Very good. Very good. Yeah. It's the season. Heaves me off. What?
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:51.360]   What? Well, so the good news was was tearing a lollipop out of my mouth. Good news was I never saw
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:57.040]   Hamilton. I didn't go to see Amelen. I'm so excited. So wait, wait, wait. I'm going to be mad first.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:03.200]   They'd be happy. They'd be mad. Good news is they moved up the movie version of the stage play
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:10.560]   a year and a half. Bad news is Disney plus Disney plus you can spend 10 bucks and get Disney plus
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.760]   that much. Don't even complain. You also get subscribed and then you got to remember to cancel.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.960]   I don't want Disney plus. Well, I'm sure they'll make a UHD DVD or something of it as well. Jeff,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:28.160]   then you can just wait. Don't complain that Disney put their money show. I'm with Stacy on this one
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:34.080]   because it was not going to be till October 2021. I know I was put the problem was it was it was
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:41.120]   whiplash. I got all happy and then I got all pissed. Get the free trial. I'm a Verizon subscriber.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.200]   I get it free for a year. I'm I'm thrilled. I haven't watched anything on Disney plus,
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:51.840]   but I will be watching that. Oh, oh my gosh. That's such an inconsequential thing to be mad about.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.440]   Don't tell me what to be mad about. I'm gonna be mad about that.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:02.320]   I'm like, oh, that's like, that's like they're giving us free cake. And you're like,
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:09.920]   but it's yeah. Yeah, Marie Antoinette. How long did that work out? Speaking of revolutions,
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.560]   I am. I'm going to have to fight someone on the chat who said Thor Ragnarok was not the best of
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:20.000]   the Thor franchise, but I'm not going to fight them now. Isn't that the one directed by what's his
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.400]   name? Taka Tico. Taka Taka. He's so funny. He also does what we do in the shadows. I'm just going
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.760]   to throw that out there. Oh, he does. I didn't know that. I love JoJo Rabbit. I thought that was
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.560]   incredible. I didn't see that. Oh, it's an amazing movie, Stacy. Just amazing.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.760]   Yeah, I can understand people would be reluctant to watch it because it's a
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.880]   young boy growing up in Hitler's Germany, whose imaginary friend is Adolf.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:49.440]   And he's Jewish. No, no, he has Jewish friends. It's a little, the premise is a little, but
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.960]   it's really weird, but it's so well done. It's really cute. Yeah.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.760]   Acute, they don't be the exact right. Yes. What we do in the shadows, season two is that,
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:01.680]   and people seem to really be loving it. I watched a little bit of season one. I went,
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.120]   okay, I get it. I wasn't that excited about it, but you say season two is really good.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.200]   Well, okay. So I thought season one was funny, but it is a certain type of humor. So you do have
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:18.080]   to put like episode four of season two has this whole thing where he checks his email and it's
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:23.200]   been like a certain number of years, like a lot. And he gets a chain letter curse thing,
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:31.280]   and they all think they're cursed. And it is so funny. I just like it's just fantastic.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.000]   Can you pick up the season two or you have to watch season one?
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.800]   Oh, no. But season one was really hilarious. It's very low stakes, my friend.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:48.560]   I do need some funnier, lighter, fair, because I've, like the plot against America is, you know,
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:56.400]   like, yeah, I'll start. Yeah. No, no, that's. Hey, Uber. Uber was trying to buy Grubhub.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:02.320]   Grubhub's stock through the roof. They actually had a halt trading yesterday.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:10.880]   This has been going on for a year. They can't agree on a price. Grubhub wants to be sold,
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:16.640]   but they want to be sold for more than Uber is willing to pay. Shares of Grubhub were up 38%
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.320]   yesterday before trading was halted at one o'clock.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:27.760]   That's like an antitrust thing waiting to happen because because Uber owns Uber Eats,
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.680]   which is the same business as Grubhub. But there are others. There are many others.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.560]   Aren't there in most markets? Don't you have door dash and.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.440]   And Postmates Postmates.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:46.080]   A name of Brown that never made sense to me. Postmates?
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.360]   Yeah. What is that name? What is that?
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.080]   It sounds like it's something you get in the mail.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.920]   I think Postmates is actually, it's not just food. Isn't it like
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.760]   cigarettes? Yeah, you get cigarettes. What is it? But even that ice cream.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:04.000]   I mean, maybe not anything, but it's like Cosmo. Cosmo. And you know what? That was, I was just
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.040]   gonna say, what was the name of that bicycle service in New York City where they brought you
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:12.320]   cigarettes and ice cream Cosmo? So I was, I was a partner in a startup years ago called Daylife,
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.960]   which was basically Google News as an API. But the brand sounded like a day spa.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:24.160]   Daylife. Welcome to Daylife, where the music is low, the lights are calm.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:30.160]   And our lovely ladies will bring you, no, never mind. No, that's the wrong.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:37.600]   I also said today that Jeff's Zoom room sounds like a bad strip club from the 70s.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:43.040]   There's no champagne. Sounds like a kids playground. So what about Apple News?
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.840]   Is it apparently, and some publishers are confused about this, they're trying to get the
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:53.520]   rights to do audio versions of all the stuff on Apple News Plus. What do you think about that,
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:59.760]   Jeff? Why would a publisher not like that? Well, they don't like Apple News a lot in the
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.080]   deal that it has, but they love the huge trafficking centers. And if they make a little more money
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.560]   and they get more audience, not a bad thing. It's an interesting thing that is, you know,
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.320]   is this mean that audio, they're betting on the future of audio?
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.160]   I think everybody is, right? I know.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:25.360]   I know. I think everyone is. And I also. Look at Spotify. They spent half a billion dollars.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:32.480]   On podcasting. And, you know, just these platforms are everywhere. When you think about
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.640]   wireless headphones, and I said this with apples when they came out a long time ago,
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.440]   having something like this always in your ear makes content accessible in a way.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:46.320]   It's kind of like the quibi of news, right? Except. Except it works.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:52.320]   Except it works. And you might want to listen to it. I will say, just speaking of audio,
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.840]   because you guys are audiobook fans, did you see this story in the New York Times
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:05.520]   about the like number one audiobook narrator in Jeff? I thought it was cool for you because it
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:13.680]   talked about, and I'm going to try to find the name. The story actually had him reading parts of the
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:21.920]   you mean Eduardo Barini. Thank you. Eduardo Ballarini. The voice of God and canal
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.440]   scarred fitment and Machiavelli. So scroll down a little bit. Because this was, I just thought,
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:34.480]   super fun. There you go. Should I play? Oh, you need my audio from the front of the bar.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.800]   Let me play it again because they didn't have my audio. Suddenly I heard a loud crash from the
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:46.800]   front of the bar. Hmm. appears we've stumbled into some kind of class joint here. I don't think I've
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:54.160]   ever heard any of his books. So I just thought it was both an interesting thing, just talking about
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:01.280]   this class of celebrity. Oh, yeah, there are. I mean, you must. You listening to audio books?
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.240]   No, because I read so cool. Oh, I love audiobooks. And there are definitely narrators that you go.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:11.520]   Oh, you actually choose a book because of the narrator. Yes. And I reject them. I go berserkos.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.920]   You're mad at me for you mad against, Stacy. But you know, if you have like a World War II book
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:19.840]   and they don't know how to pronounce German. Oh, that's bad. I just can't take it. I just can't.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:27.280]   I love you got me into Audible Leo. Oh, good. I knew it was there, but you really got me excited
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:33.120]   about it. And we really, I love about Audible is the fact you can return a book with no problem.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.400]   Yeah, they're very good about that. You can even give it 15 minutes. If I'm not going to like it,
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:43.200]   it's no risk. Right. And actually, when Daniel Suarez came in, he's been in several times
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:49.840]   where big fans of his books. And he, I think one of the early interviews, he brought the guy who
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:55.840]   reads his books, Jeff Gurner, with him. And it was so awesome. Because it was really a dual interview.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:02.240]   I'm interviewing Daniel, who I love. He's become a good friend. And then we turn to Jeff and he
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.000]   reads and you hear it. And when you hear it, it's like, yes, that's it. That's the voice.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:13.280]   Really big. So that's it. Yeah. And this article, they had some author do a book talk, but then he
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:19.360]   had this guy there to read it to read it because that's the voice. You don't. And it is such hard work.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:25.280]   Yeah, I've done it. It is very difficult, readily hard work. Oh, God. I especially when you talk
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:32.480]   like I do, and half of it's mushmouth. I speed up. I would not know that I would, I would have you
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:39.520]   read my books, Jeff, unless they were angry. If they were angry books, which you would need to read
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:44.320]   your book. Actually, your book, they'd have a female narrator. They're pretty good about getting
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:51.200]   the the narrator to match the sex, the gender of the author, or the voice in the novel. I was
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:55.280]   about to say, what if I wrote a book in the point of view was a man? Then it would be a man. Then it
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:01.280]   would be a man. So they always want the the reader to be if it's a first person book, always will
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:07.840]   match the gender. So that's distressing that limits my choice of audio books. If I wanted to read
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:15.760]   audio books to people, you could you have such a good voice. Yes. I really wanted to do that sort
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:22.800]   of thing for a while. But you still could. Now even I did refer the blind. There was a charity for
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.920]   reading for the blind from one time. I used to be on the board of that. Oh, my great aunt was too.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.800]   So I'm gonna have to listen to some of ballerini's.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:40.960]   What are some of the other books he's done? He did the the six volume Carl Ove now
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:49.360]   scarves my struggle. Oh, that's a struggle. Yeah, missed that one. 135 hour monologue took
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:55.600]   them more than 200 hours over the course of five years to record. You'd have to really like a book.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:04.480]   Oh, wow. I'm listening to a war and piece that is not great, but it's interesting. In fact,
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.800]   let me play it. I think I can play it if I log into my audible account. That's one of the nice
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   things audible does now is you can play back from the web page as well. But it's an old it's it.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:21.200]   This is the old style of audio books. Some more ballerini is more of the new style,
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:28.480]   which I think is good. He's more he's more bringing it to life. This guy, let me see if I can find it.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:37.840]   This guy is like like a 1940s actor. His name is Frederick Davison. Here, I'll play a little bit
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:44.080]   of it. On the contrary, brimming over with excitement and impulsiveness. To be enthusiastic,
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.600]   had become her pose in society all the time, even when she had indeed no inclination.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:56.160]   I don't know if I can do 61 hours. I have constipation. Yeah, I know. It's audio constipation.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:01.360]   That's the female voices really well, which is hard for a male narrator to do. She was enthusiastic.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:06.480]   So as not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The affected smile,
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:11.360]   which played continually about how he could be. It might be. Well, yeah, I feel like he should
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.720]   be reading Pride and Prejudice more than words. Did we play some time ago the Stephen Fry about
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:23.840]   Harry Potter? He did. It's the Harry Potter books in the UK. We got so Jim Dale in the US.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.280]   I just put it in the chat. It does more of the characters, which I think is wonderful.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.320]   But gosh, I think Stephen Fry's magnificent. I just put it in the chat. It's hilarious. If you
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.040]   want to take two minutes, it's hilarious. Let me see if I can. But it's on Facebook.
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.040]   Oh, Facebook. Jeff.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:48.640]   No, that's fine. Let me click it. I think I can now actually visit Facebook legitimately having an
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:57.920]   account and all. Stephen Fry on a Harry Potter pronunciation pickle. 90s. My agent called me up
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.000]   and said, there's a children's story. Would you do an audiobook of it? It was called Harry Potter
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   in the Philosopher's Stone. Unless you're American, where the word "philosopher" would terrify you.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.640]   It's called Harry Potter in the Sorcerer's Stone in America. I read it and I thought it was rather
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   good. It was about that. Oh, it turns out he's some sort of wizard. It goes to school and he's
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:24.240]   taught all his spells. I thought, this is good. I went along and I met the author who's introduced
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.640]   to me. It's just Joan Rowling and I met her and she was really nice. She shook hands.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:37.440]   And I started breathing it. It was good fun. And then on the second day, second and half day,
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:43.360]   or whenever I'd finished, I said to her, do you know what? I think this is pretty good. I think it's
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.560]   going to do well. She said, well, actually, I've already finished a second one. And I said,
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:57.680]   good for you. The way she tells it, I'm a lot more patronizing than I like to remember.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:05.040]   But by the third one, this had become something of a phenomenon, as you can imagine. And by the
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:09.920]   fourth, it was insane. The second one was the Chamber of Secrets, the third one was the Prison
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:14.720]   of Azkaban. But I remember in that book, and this is the thing about reading, when you read a book
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:22.080]   for recording, I can usually go fairly well without making too many mistakes. Some actors
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:28.960]   are slower and some quicker, but I try not to. Thank you. I'm not saying this to show off because
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.080]   actually I come out of this very badly. But there was one phrase, and this is what happens
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:40.800]   that tripped me up. It was just three words. It's ridiculous. Three words. And I couldn't say it.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:46.800]   Three words were Harry Pockety-Dit. I still can't say it. Harry Pockety-Dit.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:55.600]   I can say Harry, and I can say Pockety-Dit. I always, and so we were doing it. I was going,
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.320]   Harry Pockety-Dit. And Joe Rowling wasn't in the studio because this was the third book, I think,
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:06.880]   the Azkaban book, and there were the Dementors and everything. And everyone started laughing
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:13.360]   in the engineer in the studio. I said, "Look, can we come back to Harry Pockety-Dit-Dit at the
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:21.760]   end of the day maybe? I'll just try it." So at lunchtime I call up Joe Rowling, and I say,
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.440]   now she had very, I think wisely from the beginning, even when it was just one book,
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:32.640]   she had wanted the audiobook to be complete, unabridged, not condensed in any way as
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.800]   sometimes audiobooks are because she felt that if children were reading it and listening at the
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:42.480]   same time, they would be annoyed if it was different. So she wanted, so it was very important that we
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:48.720]   got it exactly right. So I called her up and said, "Look, do you mind? I can't say Harry Pockety-Dit-Dit-Dit-Dit.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:54.240]   Would it be okay if I said Harry put it in his pocket?" And she, there was a big pause in the
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:24:06.320]   alignment, and she said, "No." In her best witchy's voice. And I could hear the smile in the
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:12.800]   voice when she said it. So I managed to get it out, but this is a mark of the woman. The phrase,
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:20.800]   "Harry Pockety-Dit" appears in every subsequent book. She kept writing it in because you knew
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:26.880]   Stephen will have to read each and every... I love that. I love that. One. I was very fortunate
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:32.400]   because in the early days, in the second book, she was still touring, and she did a book reading
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.480]   in Sonoma County up here in Santa Rosa. And I took my daughter, it was only about seven or eight at
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.080]   the time. I said, "Remember this because she's going to be very famous and you're going to have
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:44.560]   seen her and we got her autograph." And she said, "The one question she gets all the time is,
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:54.800]   how do you pronounce "Hermi" one?" I lied. It's Hermione. Hermione. Americans apparently don't
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.440]   know how to pronounce "Hermi" one. That is not an American name. Not an American name. If it were
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:06.320]   to this day, when I see the word epitome, I think epitome. There is somebody on Twitter,
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:14.720]   he's a gramarian who goes around correcting stuff. He tweeted at me. It's a way to make friends.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.040]   Is this dryer? No, no, no. I wish it were dryer. I wish it was for an autograph.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:29.360]   He said, "Leo, it's epithet, not epithet." Fine. "Empathhet." All right. I do say epithet for some
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:35.520]   reason. I don't know why. I've got a little bit of a... Bike Boba Fett. I have love in his face,
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:42.240]   out of keeping as it was with her faded looks, expressed as spoiled child's continual consciousness
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:48.240]   of a charm. I couldn't do it. No. That was going to be returned.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.360]   [Laughter]
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.880]   Let's see. What else? Let's take a little break. We come back. We can do the change.
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.720]   How about that? All right, everybody. You didn't feel like it last week. You weren't up to it.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.760]   You just didn't have the mojo. This week you got it back. This change luck sucks too.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.920]   But it's okay. Sell it, Leo. Sell it.
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:12.880]   You might as well just stop for you now because it's going to be terrible.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:21.520]   We're going to do the change luck in just a second. They're trying to help me be the best I can be.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:27.840]   I'll show you today brought to you by our good friends at Worldwide Technology. You know I'm a
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:34.560]   huge fan of worldwide technology. It'll always have a soft spot in my heart because it was the last
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:40.960]   trip we took before all this happened. Early March, Lisa and I went out to St. Louis to visit
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:48.160]   their Advanced Technology Center. Wow. Wow. It was so impressive. Worldwide technology
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:56.560]   is an vendor of enterprise technology, a consultant. They help people. They do software.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:01.840]   It's one of the top technology solution providers in the world. They deliver business and technology
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:07.600]   outcomes to big companies, private enterprises, public organizations all over the globe.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.360]   Their business really is digital transformation. We're in the midst of that for business worldwide
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:19.920]   right now. It is phenomenal what's going on as people move to the cloud. One of the ways they
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:25.120]   support organizations with this transformation is helping them adopt a multi-cloud architecture.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:29.360]   That can be challenging, and there are disadvantages as well as advantages,
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.680]   but they know them all. They've been there. They've done that and they can help you make that
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.240]   transition. They stay with you every step of the way from the vision and strategy to
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:43.280]   enablement, migration to cloud optimization and management and everything in between.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:49.520]   They have great cloud consultants. They'll sit down with you. This is one of the things that is
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:56.720]   the hallmark of worldwide technology. Before they do anything, they will really get to know what
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:02.080]   your vision is, what your long-term strategy is because they know that those investments in
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:05.760]   enterprise technology, especially cloud, only pay off when they're aligned to your business
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:12.080]   goals. That's the very first thing they're going to do. Then, through briefing and workshops,
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.760]   that's the other thing they give back. They pass out knowledge all the time.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:21.360]   WWT has all of these ways that organizations can unravel the complexities of the cloud,
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.880]   unlock business opportunities. We did an event with them in St. Louis in March. I hope to do
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:32.640]   many more over the next few years. They are experts in cloud migrations in application
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:37.440]   development. They have an amazing app development team. They can create a secure landing zone in
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:43.520]   any cloud for your organization, for your business. That advanced technology center is
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:48.800]   amazing with on-demand labs that can give you access to tools. You can try stuff. You can pilot
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.640]   stuff. You can see if it works, if it makes sense for you, things like microservices,
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.680]   cloud-native development. Once you're up in the cloud, WWT helps with management and optimization,
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:03.600]   because it's a continuum. You just put it up there and set it and forget it. Being in the cloud
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.120]   requires constant attention to detail, but they're there to work with you on that.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.720]   Whether your strategy calls for cloud native, hybrid cloud, or even on-prem resources,
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:18.400]   because that's what they've done for years, WWT works closely with Intel to optimize for the
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:23.520]   latest cloud smart solutions based on Intel technology for security, for performance,
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:29.200]   and of course for agility. They also feature Intel's obtained persistent memory and other
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:36.000]   Intel technologies. Workload optimized to deliver affordable large capacity and data persistence
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.800]   for solutions supporting everything from VDI to data analytics. W, W, T. Don't just talk the talk,
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:49.120]   walk the walk with worldwide technology. Find out more at www.wt.com/twitt and don't forget,
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:54.320]   if you create a MyWWT account, you'll be able to access all sorts of resources at their advanced
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:30:02.000]   technology center, ecosystem papers, white papers, labs. You can even do your own on-demand labs
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.400]   from anywhere in the world. You don't even have to go to St. Louis. www.wt.com/twitt.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:11.920]   Their time is now for WWT. Worldwide technology, delivering business and technology outcomes
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:17.520]   throughout the world. We're so happy to be partnered with them. And the minute we can go back to St.
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.160]   Louis, we're going to do it because that was a fantastic trip. Really appreciate their support.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:30.960]   All right. Now, Jeff, are you ready? I'm on prem. I've never heard on prem. I've never heard of
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.600]   on prem. You don't talk the talk, man. On prem. No, I just want to say the same. Your servers live
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:41.040]   on in your data center. You could have them on premises or you could have up there in the cloud.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:47.440]   I figured it out. I just never heard. Oh, yeah. It's a talk at mid-price talk. You're so cool.
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:52.960]   Yeah. I did it in a fresh shit talk to you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Google change log.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:31:00.320]   The Google change log. Oh, it's the most exciting Google change log since last week.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:04.560]   Where he couldn't bear to do it. He was so down.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:13.280]   People thought that I was gone. I mean, I got there was a whole thread started up in the
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:18.400]   trick community. Thank you. We appreciate you, Leo. They thought I was just going to get up,
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:23.120]   walk out the door and never come back. You know what? Here was my thinking there.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.440]   I think we all go. There's ups and downs throughout this race. We all go through this cycle.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:35.920]   Most on-air personalities, it's our job to project a positive upbeat persona. We don't always feel
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:42.080]   that way. No, that's the plastic vision of this. That's my podcast. I can do that. But I thought,
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:48.080]   you know what? If I maybe I'm feeling a pain, I thought it would be good for you to see that we
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:54.560]   all are going through this. That's all. I thought it would be like, yeah, I got a lot of those too.
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.520]   Yeah. Somebody in our Twitter community said, if you ever do that again, I'm never listening.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.720]   Jeez. Wow. Well, that's a way to buck you up.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:09.840]   It's funny. There are people in the world. And I guess I understand this.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:14.320]   Who think if they email you or tweet or say something like,
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:19.600]   that's it. I can never listen to you ever again. I'm going to go, oh, no.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:27.680]   No, I'm so sorry. What can I do? It's like, OK, fine. No one's making you.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.800]   And you shouldn't listen if you're not happy. I certainly don't want anybody who doesn't enjoy
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.760]   this show to listen. That would be a mistake. I don't listen to shows. I don't read books that
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:41.600]   I don't like. I don't listen to shows. I don't like if I'm watching a TV show and I don't like it,
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:48.800]   I stop. Don't suffer, please, on my behalf. But you're going to enjoy this change lock.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:50.400]   This is going to be good.
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:58.160]   Juicy. They're trying to cheer me up. No, it's true. All right. I'll tell you, guess which stories
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:02.320]   I'm excited about. I'll find. I'll make it into a game. I'll raise my hand when I think it's a story.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:07.760]   You're excited and Google lens lookups now include in line search results.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:11.680]   When we already did that one, didn't we copy to computer text shortcut?
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:20.640]   I don't think so. I don't care. Oh, here's a big one. Alphabet's balloon powered
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:27.600]   loon internet comes to Mozambique. Is your hand raised? Is this one for you?
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:33.920]   This is one for you. You excited? Really? Loon. Loon in the world is very fun.
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:39.600]   It's a little carrier. These are giant balloons that fly in the stratosphere to give you internet.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.160]   Yeah, they're bringing internet to Mozambique, although I don't know if Mozambique has it.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.160]   I wouldn't guess that was tasty. Really?
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.520]   I thought you were born excited in life. It is fun to say it's a spy.
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:53.200]   But I don't even know if I could put my finger on Mozambique on a map, to be honest with you.
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:34:01.840]   OK, if Mike Pompeo came to me and said, you don't even know where Mozambique is on the map,
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.880]   I might have to say you're right, sir. I think it's next. Is it next to Kenya?
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.920]   It's next to Kenya. Very good. That's exactly right.
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.560]   I mean, if the map had no countries on it, though, I would have a hard time or like no
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:18.240]   other names. I believe you're right. It's in West Africa.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.960]   Loon is, by the way, there's not the first place Loon has deployed.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:28.800]   They're doing Puerto Rico. That's right. After the hurricane, Kenya, just next door,
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:32.480]   I hear. I've been told next door to Mozambique is right now.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.480]   I have to look up where Mozambique is just to make sure.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:40.480]   And Peru, which of course is on the west coast.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:50.160]   It is actually Kenya is not here. It's next to the Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.160]   Malawi, thank you.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:35:01.520]   Peru, of course, mountainous. So very difficult in the Andes to provide internet service.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:07.920]   I would guess in Puerto Rico, of course, flattened by hurricane and having power issues
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:12.960]   and infrastructure issues. These are places where a big balloon providing internet might be
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:17.120]   really a good idea. I thought Google had kind of given up on Loon, so I'm glad to see
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.720]   being a professor. See, this is why I thought it was okay. I just have to tell people
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:26.160]   to the north of Mozambique is Tanzania, and to the north of it.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:29.360]   How is it? Tanzania?
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:36.480]   North of Tanzania is Kenya. North of Kenya is Somalia and Ethiopia.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:42.400]   It's actually kind of central West Africa, not northwest Africa, but Kenya and Somalia.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:42.960]   Yes.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.920]   So there was a Facebook executive who was having hellacious internet connectivity
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:54.240]   and asking people what to do. And I stopped myself and say it. I said, just have Mark,
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:55.760]   but one of those pliers up in the air.
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:01.040]   Akila, I think Facebook did give up on Akila.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.280]   So it was so big nice to Google. Maybe they'll put a little bit of a
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:10.320]   mountain view. Yeah, that's cool. Google Meet, now free. What we talked about that last week,
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.000]   too. We talked about that. Oh, forever.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.920]   Well, not, I mean, forever.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.240]   Moving on, let's let's do some things that are.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.560]   This post is from May 12th. So I don't know forever. Google Duo has had a group of
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.440]   costs about it forever. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's not for forever.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.760]   No, Google, we keep the story going long enough to really frustrate Stacey, you know,
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:34.000]   and me. Don't forget me. Google Duo adding group calls
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:41.520]   to with up to 32 people feel like we did this. You call it duo anymore. It's not just two.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:47.600]   What is the word for 32? I don't know. You know, Apple had, they had 32 people on FaceTime,
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.800]   but they did this really awful thing where they would float the person talking.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:54.560]   You'd see all these bubbles of people and then they'd float the person talking forward.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:59.680]   It was so disturbing. They just they stopped. They stopped doing it because no one won.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:07.120]   No, don't do it. Google will kill. And this we found out, by the way, yesterday,
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:13.840]   because we had the person in charge of YouTube music on Google is going to replace play music
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:19.600]   this year with YouTube music and they will offer a migration tool because many of us
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.880]   uploaded music to Google play music. So that I tried to migrate and said it wasn't my turn.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.840]   Oh, I just started using YouTube music because you get it anyway.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:38.880]   And I like YouTube music, actually. It's dark mode.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.880]   I didn't cause a connection fit by Jeff. I was surprised. He wasn't listening. He was looking.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:48.960]   Google podcasts, by the way, can import your play music podcast subscriptions as part of this.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:54.480]   I like your podcast. Wait, so you have to import you to do a dual split import
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:01.200]   your music on YouTube and your podcasts onto Google podcast. Yeah, that's Google Google.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:06.720]   Google Spotify like every normal human man.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:13.360]   Finally, this is actually the one I'm going to raise my hand on. For a long time, I told people,
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:19.120]   please don't use Google Authenticator use Authy for your authentication tool because Google
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:25.200]   Authenticator had a fatal flaw. If you change phones, you had to set up all of your two factor
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.080]   all over again. There was no way to export it out of Google Authenticator. Thank goodness.
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:37.680]   Now there is you can transfer accounts between between devices. So this will eventually come to
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:43.840]   you. I mean, the first time that happens to you, you're like, never again, leap leap, ever again,
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:49.840]   Authy is great. It's free. It's from Twilio, which is a great company. Stacey knows all about him.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:52.480]   You can ask her if you're not. It is a great concern.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:59.440]   And in fact, I talked to the guy. He came to visit our studio a few months ago, who does Authy.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:05.360]   So I said, thank you because you offer a really great free authenticator that has this one feature,
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.160]   which is an account so that you can log into your Authy account anywhere. And there's all of your
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.520]   authentication codes, which is really nice. Google Authenticator is going to do that too.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:22.640]   From version five to version 5.1. Look for it. Soon, Google's Nest cameras will be used to
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:30.320]   monitor coronavirus patients at Mount Sinai to cameras in each room. This way, nurses can stay
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:37.120]   seated. You would think they'd have cameras in the hospital rooms in the
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:45.520]   ICU. You would think privacy. One of the cool things is you can use the Nest camera to talk
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.520]   and listen because they have microphones and speakers. So one of the cameras will be used to
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:53.120]   communicate with the patient. The other one will be pointing at the screen where their vitals
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:57.840]   are showing, which I think is really great and it'll be streamed to. Oh, you know, I'm trying to
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:06.240]   help actually a hospital system in someplace. Illinois, I feel like figure out how to do this
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:11.360]   with Amazon Echoes. It's actually quite a challenging problem to do at scale. Maybe think about doing
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:15.200]   it with Google because even though this is the first time Google's done it, they said they plan
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:20.480]   to provide 10,000 Nest cams that are specifically designed for this kind of monitoring the hospitals
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:28.880]   around the country. Raise your hand. That's exciting. Raise your hand. I think easier to do
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:34.640]   that with a Nest. I have, I use the Nest cameras all around our house. As I mentioned before,
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:41.360]   replaced a ring with a hello camera doorbell, but I also have Nest cameras, you know, around
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:47.120]   the outside. I really think they do a good job. I'm very happy with them. The quality of the
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.200]   image is good and the notifications work well. It's not cheap because you have to buy a Nest
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:57.120]   subscription, but that's life. Oh, that's changing too. Is that on your list?
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.600]   Is it? Tell me. The Nest subscription changes. Yeah. Is that not in here? No.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:08.640]   Oh, Google is changing their Nest to Wear subscription plans. So now,
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:14.560]   oh, let me look this up. Okay. Keep going and I'll come back to me on this when I have the
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.320]   exact impression because I don't want to mess it up. Good. It seems fair. It seems only fair
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:22.160]   that you should help since you're making me do the Google change log.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:30.240]   Oh, it's so brutal. Okay. Now I have it. Here we go. Good. Yes. So cranky. All right.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.160]   So what they're doing is they simplify their pricing. The new Nest to wear.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:41.440]   Yes. $6 a month or $60 for an annual subscription. That gives you 30 days of event video history.
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.680]   Oh, fantastic. And that's for everything.
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:47.600]   For all the camera speakers in this place. And I have a lot of them.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:53.440]   Now, if you only have one camera, this is not a boy no deal because... No, it's a buck more.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:42:00.080]   It'd be like, oh, suck. It's going to be more expensive. It's incentive to get more. I have one,
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:08.160]   two, three, four, five. Actually, one doesn't have a camera. It's the mini hub.
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:13.520]   But I have four with cameras. So that's a good deal for me. Six bucks a month.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.240]   That is because I think it was it was at $5 a month for...
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.240]   Yeah. Yeah. Each camera.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:24.160]   Money. Oh, I forgot. I have two here. Also on my subscription. So for S&B's,
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:29.760]   I actually think they have a 24/7 video history one called Nest to Wear Plus that is 60 days of
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:36.800]   video history and 10 days of 24/7 video. And that's $12 a month. And I would think if you were using it
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:42.320]   like in a camera purpose for like a business, that might actually be better for you.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:47.760]   We have one in each studio as kind of a security camera. But we also have real security cameras.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.240]   These are just mine. So I can see if anybody's at work.
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:56.000]   Because if somebody's here, I don't want to come in. I only come in when everybody's gone home.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:04.160]   You know what? I must have to upgrade it because I was a little annoyed because Amazon said they
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:10.320]   had delivered something and they didn't. And I went back, I gave them five or six days,
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:14.240]   you know, in case they made a mistake and it never came. And then I went back and said,
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:19.840]   well, let me, I can probably check the Nest camera from that period of time. And it already erased it.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.560]   So I got to get the 30 days should be enough. Right? That's a lot.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:33.840]   That's a lot. Google Play launches, change the game design. It's a challenge for students.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:39.520]   This is kind of cool to submit ideas for original mobile games. Starting today, we're
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.040]   accepting applications for 2020 change the game design challenge. And this is a good thing for
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:49.600]   kids who are, you know, at home from school, if you're between the ages of 13 and 18,
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.480]   you can submit an idea for your original mobile game along with a statement on why you're passionate
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:02.160]   about gaming or what changes you'd like to see in the gaming industry. May 11th through July 31st,
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:06.880]   they'll hold online workshops starting in June, running through the end of the summer. If you're
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:12.000]   selected for the workshop, you'll be grouped with a few others for a four session crash course
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:18.320]   on game development hosted by girls make games. So if you, you know, I know there's a lot of 13
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:22.800]   year olds out there who say, Oh, I really want to learn how to do game design. I don't get Michael
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.880]   to get involved in this. One of Michael's friends keeps coming to me and say, help me make a game.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:37.280]   Help me make a game. This would be perfect. This is Google plays change the game design contest.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:44.880]   And it's at play.google.com. You can submit your idea there. Sounds looks like they're focused on
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:52.160]   young young women, which is cool. Game changers. I love this. Thank you, Google. What a good idea.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:56.960]   Yes, we can. Google's 3D animals.
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:04.720]   Well, you're right. This is a pretty dull. Oh, come on. This is the best part. 30 plus
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:12.160]   augmented reality critters that can be on your phone. It's a new zoo. You can even have videos
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:19.920]   of these and other cool 3D objects on you. Wouldn't you like a tiger in your tank or in your swimming
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:32.720]   pool? Just great. All right, hold on. There's got to be something better. Kids can learn at home
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:38.720]   with read along by Google. Kids, would you like to read me too? Are you raising your hands?
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:44.640]   No, this is good. This is exciting. I'm going to beat it. You keep going, but I'm going to beat
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:50.800]   this one. You keep going. Kids are trying to learn how to read.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:58.320]   It's first launched in India. They call it Bolo there. They're now introducing it in 180
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:04.080]   countries and nine languages. This is cool because what it's doing is it gives you,
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:09.200]   and this is not unusual. A lot of reading apps, learn to read apps, let kids read along,
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:12.880]   and it has little bouncing balls and things like that. What's cool about this is Google's
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:19.440]   listening to your kid and ties it back and says, "Oh, you said this word correctly," or you didn't.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:24.560]   So people who go epitome, Google would say, "No, it's epitome." And you'd be like, "Thanks,
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:30.160]   Goog." No, you know what? That's what made me as ironic as I am.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:37.600]   Mrs. Thompson's class in third grade, we had to sit and we had to read out loud in circles.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:45.280]   If you made the slightest little error, little Steve, that brat. Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Thompson,
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:50.000]   I believe Jeffrey made a mistake. Oh, I hate that kid. Made me scared to read out loud for
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.640]   for years and years. You know, it makes me feel better. Find out what Steve's doing today.
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:00.880]   Steven Gravat. Yeah, go find out. What is, you know, he's probably, you know, find out. He's
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:05.360]   probably that grammar guy who corrected me on Twitter. But I'm going to beat that Stacy. I'm
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:10.240]   going to make you happy. I'm not done. I'm not done. I want to say, you can do this without
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:15.600]   signing in and no data is sent to Google's servers. The voice data is analyzed in real time
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.800]   on the device. So if you're concerned about privacy, so is Google. This is a really good idea. Look
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.480]   for it in the place where it's called read along. Of course, you have to have an Android device.
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:30.240]   I don't think that's a concern about privacy thing. I think that's a children's DCM.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:39.040]   CC to be D B D B D D B. What do I put something to beat this in the chat? Okay. I'm not done yet.
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:46.560]   Okay. With that story, it's a beat. That's it ties in with this to that story. Okay. Yes. So
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:53.920]   then so I'm going to make her more excited. Kids are reading to therapy dogs on zoom.
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:01.280]   They can't pet pooches, but the sessions book book book up. You want to watch this beat Steven
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:09.760]   Gravat? Yeah. But I bet Steven would say, can you see me dog? But you shouldn't be on what I'm
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.360]   reading to you. I want some video. I guess you can't have it. Isn't that nice? See?
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:21.120]   That is nice. Who's doing this? This is a really good idea. That is a good idea.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.640]   Part of the PAL program. They used to do that. I mean, they do this in person beforehand. I know
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:33.600]   that your dog can go to the library. My daughter used to talk to me read to. Yeah. They like it.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.000]   When you talk to them. Okay. My daughter used to read to the cat and it was just the sweetest thing.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.080]   And that's not for years. She did it. Cat loved it. My daughter loved it.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:51.360]   So go to peopleanimalslove.org, which is PAL. And you can, if you have kids who want to read to
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:57.040]   the dog, hey kids, now you can respond to a PAL dog from home. They do this as you're absolutely
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.560]   right. They do this in person normally. But now they're doing it on zoom. I mean, I can show my dog
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:08.320]   and have people read to my dog. That's fine. Yeah. I think that's kind of cute. But you're
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:14.640]   going to correct them. You're going to say no. It's epitome. Mommy. Is that dog, dad?
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:24.160]   Mommy. I think the dog died. Mommy. Mommy. Does it like? Well, the nothing, nothing at all.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:32.800]   She was just like, no. Oh God. I don't even want to do the rest of these. That's the Google change
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:38.480]   log. You can't get better than ending with people reading the dogs. That's perfect. Yeah, right.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.280]   See, they're I gave you nothing to do with Google.
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:54.000]   He's a drummer. We got it. It's not Jeffries fault. There's something to sluggish some sluggish
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:01.120]   drinkaster. They got some goop in the veins and it's just moving very slow. Normally we would do
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.240]   a restart, but we'll do that after the show.
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:10.880]   This I think looks like something that perhaps Jeff Jarvis added to the
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:19.440]   mix. Excellent Ben Evans piece. Is this your? Ben's really good. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, just
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:23.440]   talking about rolling in collapses. So he starts with rim and says, you know, rim.
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:31.200]   Didn't die right away. The blackberry guys. Yeah. Yeah. They're not. Yeah. They didn't die right
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:37.200]   away. It took time, but they did die. Okay, sort of. No, they have an IOT software platform. Yeah,
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:42.720]   they own Q and S. Yeah. And then it's actually in a lot of things and they now have an IOT security
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:47.520]   platform. But the fun part, go on. Go on. Tell me more how he calls it the Wiley Coyote effect.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.480]   Right. So on the call. Yeah, then it falls off.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:58.240]   He shows searches for BBM for iPhone, BBM for Android and how it went. So he's talking,
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:03.440]   he just uses this as the way to talk about waves of disruption and how with COVID,
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:13.200]   things like e-commerce, he starts with newspapers. He looks at US is massively overstored. We have
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:20.640]   24 square feet per capita for retail in the US. We know that.
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:25.760]   And you can see the problem with the Wiley Coyote thing is that thanks to COVID, you've got all
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.160]   these cliffs that all of these businesses are right. That's what he's saying. This is going to
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:34.400]   push him. Yeah. So it was just it was interesting post for folks who care about this. I mean, I can't
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:41.280]   imagine indoor malls surviving this. Can you? There were there were dead beast anyway.
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:49.760]   Department stores were unnecessary anyway. Right. US pay TV subs are down 20% in falling.
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:55.040]   Cable companies suffering big time as Netflix, which is the gray bar goes up.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:52:02.880]   Comcast and the others go down for all my newspaper people who scream about how Google stole our money.
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:06.560]   More than two thirds of Google and Facebook ads,
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:10.080]   as advertisers that were never in traditional advertising at all.
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:16.560]   That was the big story. Thanks to Australia in a real debate going on right now, because of
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:20.800]   course, and we talked about this a little bit last week, Australian regulators look like
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:25.040]   they're about to make Google start paying for the snippets that they include in Google News and
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:31.600]   Google search. And a lot of people are saying bravo because it's all Google's fault that journalism
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:38.400]   and I knew that you would be great. Well, I did a law. So so Ben Smith, the former editor of Buzzfeed
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:44.000]   News, now the David Carr or would be David Carr of the New York Times, were in a column which was
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.120]   pure Murdoch company line in favor of that Australian stuff. Right.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:52.960]   And I went through a Twitter typhoon. They're about what I like it a Twitter typhoon,
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:53:00.080]   not just a storm. It was a typhoon. What is what is doom doom scrolling?
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:05.360]   So doom school, I found this. It's kind of cool. So people complain that, oh my God,
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:10.400]   we're all just doom scrolling. We're going through all this news about COVID now,
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:15.840]   and it's driving us nuts. Yes. And we're awful. Well, of course, when these things happen,
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:22.320]   just like any good information you want to have. So during World War one,
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:27.600]   there was much complaint that people were too much thirst for war news.
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:34.080]   In the Saturday review in 1915, talked about the part that newspapers played the first two
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:40.000]   year that the war were cruel, ignorant for news. I'm sorry, cruel eagerness for news, tortured everybody.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.440]   When even the poor spent their pets recklessly, as if pennies and happens were coined in every
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:48.480]   household in the benefit of actual discussion. It says if you use paper reading at a tendency
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:55.120]   to throw some people off their balance. So it was a cool little piece. So I went from that,
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:01.680]   I went, I went, I went to doom clicking and then found great stuff about about how books,
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:08.480]   of course, were presumed to be terrible, especially for you women Stacy. They're going to cause
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:14.720]   vapors romances were very bad. Oh, yeah, the novels we were dopples were terrible for. Well,
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:19.200]   actually, the women were only supposed to read smart novels, or like novels, as opposed to like
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:23.920]   policy papers and things for men. There were magazines for women
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:29.680]   early on the history of magazines. Yes, there are now, but they're early on in the history.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:34.800]   It was the first kind of publishing was correct women. So that was a doom, doom scrolling. I
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:38.880]   thought you'd like that. Yeah, we're all doing it. It's not that it's bad to look for that information,
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:43.440]   it just can make you nuts. Right, you get over as the world, the world. That's how I feel about
[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:48.560]   everything coming out of the White House in this administration, all their press releases. I'm like,
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:52.800]   Oh, no, it's kind of hard not to watch the press conferences. It was so funny yesterday.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:57.440]   That's kind of hard not to watch. And by the way, I know you're going to send me emails saying,
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:03.200]   I'm never listening to the show again, if you bash our fine president. How can anybody at this point
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:10.320]   be thinking, I have to think you're a Russian bot at this point. If you think that this is that
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:17.760]   80,000 people dead is in some way a success. I mean, I don't understand.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:23.520]   I'll still be. It's China's fault. Oh, it's all. Yeah, China, the kung flu. Yeah.
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.120]   Let's not talk about politics. No, no, I'm not. I'm not because I want to talk about podcasting
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:36.400]   luminary has now raised another 30 million who would give these guys more money.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:41.040]   They've raised 30 million dollars not trying to build their business, just trying to
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:51.120]   shore it up as it collapses. They have now raised their 160 million dollars to do this
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:57.360]   podcast network. Former HBO executive, Richard Pappler, who's quite famous.
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:05.600]   I mean, he's, you know, he put HBO on the map. Also, the NEA and Sinai Ventures
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:11.680]   raised $130 million. They want to call it. They wanted it to be the Netflix of podcasts.
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:15.040]   That was the elevator pitch right there. That's all you had to say. Oh, it's the Netflix of
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:22.720]   podcasts. Here's $130 million. Then no, only 80,000 people who tried the app have still pay
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:28.400]   are still paying their blues and money hand over fish. So they've raised another 30 million,
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:32.400]   but it's not because they're doing great. It's because they're doing terribly.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:37.840]   They're burning four million a month before the coronavirus outbreak while generating less
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:43.680]   than half a million in monthly revenue. We make more money than they did.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:47.920]   [laughter]
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:53.600]   I mean, our revenue was higher than theirs was, but I didn't lose $4 million a month. I actually
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:59.360]   made money in it. But that's- And you never took any money? Yeah. Yeah. I thank God I didn't take any money.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:07.120]   So listening is still growing according to Bloomberg. The decline is beginning to level off.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:11.680]   And you asked me before the show, I don't know what our numbers are. I'm not paying attention to that.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:15.440]   I'll tell you, that's not really in all likelihood- That wasn't curious about the number so much
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:20.240]   as trends. Yeah. That's not really the issue so much as listening numbers. I'm sure they're going up,
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:26.480]   but it's advertisers because we're headed into a great depression. And I don't blame advertisers.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:31.520]   They're very skittish and they're reluctant to spend money. Even if they have a product like Zoom
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:36.000]   that's doing really, really well, they don't need to advertise. I don't think they're buying
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.400]   any ads. So I'll go to a number. I have Rasmus Clay Stiehlson at Oxford's
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:47.280]   Reuters Center for the Study of Journalism, or News Journalism, I think it is, said that he
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:54.240]   predicts the print circulation revenue will be down 10%. Print ad revenue down 30%. Digital
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:59.680]   circulation revenue up 20%, but digital ad revenue down 20%. That's the problem. Working from that,
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:09.440]   he figures a decline of $24 billion. That's the same as the decline from 2013 to 2019 in one year.
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:14.080]   So audience is going up, revenue going down because- Yes, yes, the advertisers are
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:20.560]   doing what do they have to sell? What we're trying to do is there's plenty of companies that are
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:25.600]   booming on all this and we're trying to focus on them. But I mean, the companies like Zoom and
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:30.560]   Netflix don't need to advertise. They're doing just fine. So you're trying to find smaller companies
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:35.440]   that maybe see this as an opportunity working on companies. And the great
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:39.600]   opportunity thing you've always done in this network is to change habits. I never thought
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:44.640]   of buying a razor through the mail. Oh, okay, I'll do that. I never thought of buying a mattress
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:50.160]   through the mail. Well, Gia, now I have to. Well, okay, here's the way. But you got to figure these
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:54.960]   companies are going, well, but what's our business going to do? And I think many businesses are
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:59.760]   declining. I don't know. And there's just uncertainties, the worst possible thing. Their
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:04.560]   business may be going up, but they're uncertain. So that's the problem. And I don't think it's only
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:10.640]   luminaries fault. I think it's just tough time actually. Oh, have a little shot in Frida. Go ahead,
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:15.120]   go ahead. Jeff Katzenberg says, you know, Quibi would have been a big hit if it were for coming.
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:20.800]   Yeah. All right. Here's one that's going to give you a heart attack. France. Oh, no.
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:32.240]   And I love that there. I love France. France has decided that platforms will have one hour
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:40.880]   to remove pedophile or terrorism related content or be face of fine of up to 4% of their global
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:47.760]   revenue. That's a GDBR number. I think that's a big number. Companies like Facebook, Twitter,
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:55.040]   YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat will have 24 hours to remove manifestly illicit content. But
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:58.640]   I'm not the illegal manifestly illicit. What's the difference? I don't know.
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:05.680]   One's not the ones prescribed by law. And one is just social morays, right? You don't take us down.
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:11.680]   Your ass is crazy. Yeah, the illicit. We do not smoke marijuana in France. We drink wine.
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:18.560]   I think it's probably more like we don't let you sell or show off Hitler and Nazi paraphernalia.
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:26.720]   The one hour is for hate speech and pedophilia. And Justice Minister, Minister Nicole Belubey
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:33.520]   told Parliament, people will think twice before crossing the red line. If they know there is a high
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:39.200]   likelihood they will be held to account. All right, France, you made me do it. You made me do it.
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:43.520]   I read the entire just last three days to be three days to get through it. The entire
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:51.840]   Areopagetica by Milton. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You did that with France with quotes. No, it was England.
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:57.440]   It was when there was an effort to do licensing. And Milton was arguing, don't insult us.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:03.360]   And I'll give you my favorite quote from it. Give me the liberty to know to utter and
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:06.800]   argue freely according to conscience above all liberties.
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:14.400]   Well, he's right in the Marine Le Pen's pocket because she's, of course,
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:20.080]   a far right national rally party president said the law is a serious violation of the freedom of
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:30.400]   expression. It's a don't know what's going to happen, but 4% of your global revenue in an hour seems a
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:38.160]   little fast. An hour is kind of like ridiculous. Wow. Think about the incentive to develop technology
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:41.600]   if it could be developed. Maybe that's what they're trying to do. That's a big incentive to get you
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:45.120]   to do something. Yeah, but you know, I can't work because because I mean, look at China,
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:48.800]   where they have extremely expensive, extremely efficient censorship mechanisms.
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:53.120]   And people find ways around by creating new languages. Right. It will always happen.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:57.680]   Well, this is this is always the case. It's like it's like trying to keep you from reading novels
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:04.080]   and having the vapors, Stacy. It's it's always a new mechanism of speech comes and there's an
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:11.600]   effort to control it. And that's all that's happening now. E-commerce sales, like nobody's
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:17.360]   business, it's like it's Black Friday. U.S. E-commerce sales jumped 49% last month.
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.400]   You can't go to a store. How are you going to get your sourdough or your bread knives,
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:24.400]   right? This is whatever.
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:24.800]   Quarit.
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:33.120]   Dobi's digital economy, X index, online grocery, help drive the increase in sales with a 110%
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:38.800]   boost in daily sales between March and April. Electronic sales up to 58%. This one, you'll be
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:46.160]   both happy about book sales have doubled. Yay. Yay. What are you doing at home? What are you doing?
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:47.520]   You're reading. You're reading more.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:49.440]   Or no, you know what you're doing, Leo? What?
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:52.160]   You're stocking your Zoom bookshelf behind you.
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:57.120]   I bet a lot of it is that. I bet a lot of it is that.
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:01.280]   There is a bookstore. There's a bookstore by the foot offering that as a service.
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:01.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:07.440]   I think it's in Boston, brattle books, and they will curate the books to be behind you to make
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.120]   you look good. Oh, I like that.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:14.320]   Man, I don't buy physical books because they're they're hard to move.
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:19.520]   Too much. You're just going to fail at rate by Skype room. In fact, Stacy, you know,
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.720]   this is not a great thing. I'm sorry, but you're about a four out of 10 right there.
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:27.920]   Wait. You can see my oh wait. Yes. Check out my picture.
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:33.520]   Let's see. It's not even hung. We're sitting on the file cabinet.
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:35.520]   Wait till wait two months. Yeah, you're moving.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:36.560]   That's fair.
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:41.760]   Loose. Is it loose lips? No, keep mum. She's not so dumb. It's feminist.
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:42.640]   Oh, I like it.
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:46.240]   And keep mum. She's not so dumb.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:51.520]   She's kind of. So I just put in the chat so you can put it in the brattle book story.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:55.280]   That is good. That is good. Yeah.
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:58.960]   Folks, we got flowers too.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.240]   I like to keep mum. She's not so dumb. That is pretty awesome.
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:04.800]   By the way, why don't you hang it up?
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:06.160]   I have to.
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:09.360]   I'm in a rental in the new place. She's going to hang it.
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:14.800]   By the way, I have to say, rate my skype room. It's very first 10 out of 10.
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:19.040]   Dr. William Hazeltine, infectious disease expert,
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:25.120]   who not only has a full skeleton, but he's got a giant Saturn five rocket ship.
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:31.360]   And it looks like some sort of Egyptian pyramid plus bones.
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:35.760]   This is the best anti-pollution. By the way, I have that jacket.
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:36.720]   It's you have a name.
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:39.120]   No, it's not a rudeless. That's a very in jacket.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.360]   Is it OK to wear it, you think?
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.960]   Yeah, a value of a Bavarian jacket. Let's a fleek flag fly.
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:51.200]   10 out of 10. Is that his house?
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:55.360]   That's his office. I don't know whether it's his house or not.
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.920]   Right. He's brilliant.
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:04:59.360]   Hazeltine is really clearly.
[02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:03.360]   He discovered great things that say people.
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:04.000]   This is in the room.
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.920]   He discovered great things that you're in.
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:09.200]   Oh, I know. I discovered.
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:12.400]   German. Oh, he just worth the German jacket.
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.640]   He's a very in jacket with a pocket.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:17.920]   He's known for his groundbreaking work on HIV AIDS and the human genome.
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:18.720]   Oh, good for him.
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:21.280]   He was professor at Harvard Medical School,
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:24.400]   where he founded two research departments on cancer and HIV AIDS.
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:25.360]   And I love that room.
[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:30.960]   He also has the bookshelf, but is carefully positioned it.
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.920]   So you can't read it anyway. So there's no status.
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:35.920]   But what the hell is the giant rocket?
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.520]   Well, yeah, it's a giant room.
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.640]   Well, who doesn't want to settle a rocket?
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:41.920]   It's a great rocket.
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:43.520]   His grandchildren like it, he said,
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:45.120]   Oh man, I like that rocket.
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:50.720]   I have seen one of the original ones at the Big NASA facility at Houston.
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:51.280]   Nice.
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:53.680]   I have pictures next to me next to it.
[02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:56.560]   Are you just a little tiny person in a giant, giant rocket?
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:57.360]   Basically, yes.
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:57.680]   Cool.
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:01.920]   That's Stacy Higginbotham, who is a giant in my mind.
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:06.960]   She is the host of Stacy of the IoT show with Kevin Tofa.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:12.800]   And does a great newsletter, Stacy on IoT at Stacyoniot.com.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:15.040]   She's at Gigastacey.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:15.920]   I am sorry.
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:16.880]   I'm sorry.
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:17.440]   Okay.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.200]   Wait, do we not do pics?
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:24.640]   Oh, you made him do not feel it today.
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:25.280]   The changelog.
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:26.560]   He's trying to get out of something.
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:27.520]   He's tired.
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:28.720]   And now ladies and gentlemen,
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:29.680]   I showed Captain.
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:33.440]   She is going to give you her pick of the week.
[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:37.600]   I unfortunately did not bring it upstairs.
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:40.320]   But do you, if you know, I can't, I'll go get the August.
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:42.080]   It's the new August lock and it's smaller.
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:43.680]   And I think you guys might like to see it.
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:44.080]   Stacy.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:44.320]   But no.
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:46.720]   You could have just let it slide.
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:47.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:49.680]   You could have just got me finished the show.
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:52.480]   But no, you said, what about my pick?
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.680]   And you don't even have it.
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:58.560]   Well, I was going to bring y'all downstairs on my computer and show it to you.
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:59.120]   Can you do that?
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:00.320]   Yeah.
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.600]   Oh, let's do it.
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:04.400]   Now you're going to use my good audio.
[02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:05.120]   That's all right.
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:07.040]   Karsten, is that going to be okay for you?
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:08.560]   Karsten's somewhere in space.
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:09.760]   We can't hear Karsten.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:11.760]   It's he's crying inside.
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:12.560]   He's on the chat.
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:13.120]   Okay.
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:13.920]   He's going.
[02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:16.640]   If you want to start while I go wonder down there.
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:17.840]   Jeff, why don't you give us another number?
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:18.880]   You already gave us one.
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:20.640]   I was all happy that we were going to do this.
[02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:21.680]   And now I got to do it.
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:22.080]   Jeez.
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:22.960]   You already did that.
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:25.200]   I'm like, what's that kid's name that you hated?
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:27.200]   Timothy?
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:28.000]   Stephen Grovat.
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.560]   Probably I can suit this.
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:31.440]   Can't be real.
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:32.640]   What?
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:33.280]   This number?
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:34.960]   About the ants?
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:36.160]   Yes.
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.120]   Go ahead.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:42.080]   1.8 million people are pretending to be ants in a Facebook group.
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:42.320]   What?
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:45.760]   I know.
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:47.200]   It makes no sense at all.
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.240]   Does it make them happy?
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:48.640]   Oh, it's cute.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:51.840]   It's kind of boring.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:54.240]   I signed onto it so I can see what it was.
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:56.240]   It's very boring.
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:58.160]   Um, okay.
[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:00.640]   That's our number of the week.
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:03.200]   I have a pick for a change.
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:06.320]   Well, should we watch Stacy wander?
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:07.280]   Yeah.
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:08.560]   I'm there.
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:09.440]   Oh my god.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:12.000]   Oh, there's the August lock.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.440]   This is the new August lock.
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:18.400]   That's me manually doing it just because here I am.
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:18.640]   Yeah.
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:20.240]   And it's actually much smaller.
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:23.440]   I have mine at a higher level because of this wood trim.
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.680]   It was a little difficult.
[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:27.680]   What you'll see, it's smaller because
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:29.440]   whoop.
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:32.000]   It has new batteries inside.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.720]   It's not for triple A's or double A's.
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:35.360]   It's all right.
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:36.240]   Are those hard to get?
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:37.760]   They are.
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:39.840]   You're going to have to keep those in your house.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:40.240]   Okay.
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:42.480]   So we want to make that plate.
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:43.120]   That's nice.
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:44.800]   The other one had that too.
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:47.440]   And what else?
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:48.240]   It's also subtle.
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:49.760]   It doesn't look like anything.
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:51.520]   It just looks like a knob.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:54.400]   Uh, is that a sensor?
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:56.080]   What is that on the face of it?
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.040]   Is it a...
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:59.120]   This is the August light up in a second.
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:08:59.840]   Oh, it's a light.
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:00.240]   Okay.
[02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:01.840]   So here we go. Ready?
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:05.840]   And does this work in conjunction with your existing?
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:07.600]   Because you have a lock on there.
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:10.320]   So this is more like a deadbolt turner?
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:10.720]   Got it.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:12.960]   Do you have an existing...
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:13.920]   Oh look, it's going to do it.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:15.040]   Oh, there it goes.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:15.440]   There it goes.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:15.920]   There it goes.
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:17.200]   The red eye is awake.
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:20.000]   It turns green when it's on.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.200]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:23.200]   What's it look like on the other side?
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:24.160]   Does it have a...
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:24.800]   Oh.
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:26.080]   Is it show on the other side?
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:26.320]   Is it...
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:28.480]   Oh, looks like a regular lock.
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:29.840]   I was saying it's a regular lock.
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:31.760]   So on the other side, your key still works.
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:32.080]   Nice.
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:33.360]   Now it's going to be...
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.920]   So this would be...
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:38.800]   You would use this to open the door remotely.
[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:40.480]   Oh, but yes.
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:42.960]   Well, it auto unlocks with the Bluetooth in your phone.
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:43.600]   So if you're...
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:44.640]   Oh, I like this.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:45.600]   ...lofting up your door.
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:45.840]   Yeah.
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:47.600]   They also...
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:47.840]   No.
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:49.520]   They also have...
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:50.720]   Oh, poor dog.
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:52.160]   Mom, you open the door.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:53.360]   Well, I want to go out.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:55.440]   Oh.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:56.240]   Can I read to her?
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:59.120]   Yeah, you can read to my dog.
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:00.560]   She's not going to like it, but...
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:04.080]   Yeah, I'm sitting here kneeling and she's like,
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:06.160]   "Why are you so close to me and not petting me?"
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:09.200]   It also has an auto lock.
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:10.800]   So if you walk away from your door,
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:12.000]   it will lock.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:12.480]   Oh, nice.
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:16.080]   And it locks also after a period of time,
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:17.200]   if you have that setting.
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:19.920]   I do not because I walk outside in the backyard a lot
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:20.560]   without my phone.
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.560]   So there was an existing deadbolt on there.
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:26.080]   And because it's a rental,
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:27.200]   you'll be able to remove that
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:28.880]   and restore it to its original state
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:29.760]   without any effort.
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:32.960]   Yeah, let's show you how that works.
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.080]   There's these little wings.
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.520]   Oh, neat.
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:42.720]   Oh, it goes right on top of where the knob would be,
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:44.160]   where the bolt, the thing would...
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:46.720]   Yeah, so this is a custom Argus plate
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:48.960]   that you just swap out this
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:50.160]   for the original plate.
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:50.560]   Easy.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.160]   This is what actually turns your knob
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:55.360]   and every door knob has a different shape right here.
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:57.520]   That's not the shape of my knob, but it's okay.
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:00.960]   I get the idea, the principle.
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.440]   And then you just pop this guy back on it.
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:04.800]   It's really easy to install.
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:05.360]   I like that.
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:09.600]   So it's really just like a robot knob turner for you.
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:10.080]   It is.
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:10.560]   It is.
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:12.240]   That's exactly how you should think of it.
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:13.280]   Yeah, nice.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:14.880]   That's from August.
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:15.280]   How much?
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:18.720]   Uh, two, 49.
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.920]   99.
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:20.560]   Thank you.
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:24.000]   My pick of the week is something for Jeff Jarvis,
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.840]   because I know I feel about profanity.
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:32.960]   Finally, there is a font that won't print profanity.
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.320]   Scunthorp Sans.
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:41.520]   It's a joke, but it really works.
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:43.200]   Because as some people know,
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:46.960]   fonts aren't really just pictures of letters.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:49.920]   They're programs typefaces.
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:53.040]   And this is a nice font called Aileron.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.960]   It's public domain.
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:12:02.880]   It uses the, it actually has some intelligence to combine letters into a single ligature,
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:04.960]   which is a black mark.
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:06.320]   You can have it.
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:08.000]   Well, a ligature is like F.I. around F.L.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.280]   with two letters into one.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.960]   But they can do it for U.C.K. or H.I.T.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:13.440]   That's clever.
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:14.240]   Isn't that good?
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:15.600]   Clever.
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:18.480]   And it's named after the town of Scunthorp,
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:20.080]   which for obvious reasons,
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:23.680]   it really wishes it had a different name.
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:27.200]   But the good news is it doesn't actually block Scunthorp,
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:29.600]   because as the authors of this font,
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:32.720]   vol.wtf say that town has suffered enough.
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.200]   So you can literally,
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:38.240]   you can literally use Scunthorp Sans.
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:40.240]   You download it.
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:42.000]   It's a font.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:42.560]   It's pretty funny.
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:44.000]   It just looks like any other font.
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:48.000]   But go ahead and try to swear we should use this in our chat room.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.560]   And you won't be.
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:52.320]   Well, that would be very funny, wouldn't it?
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:53.760]   It would just, it would just,
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:56.400]   curse our chatters.
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.440]   We just pull the Chinese kind of censorship thing,
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:00.800]   and you just use different words.
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:02.480]   You do exactly what Jeff tells us.
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:03.840]   Our chatters are way too smart.
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:07.280]   They wouldn't, it wouldn't fool them for one second.
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:10.480]   Hey, this was fun.
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:14.000]   I feel so much better now after that great Google change log.
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:16.640]   And the pics.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:18.080]   And really good pics.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:19.280]   Thank you guys.
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.200]   Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Jurisalism.
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:28.560]   Jeff pocketed it.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:33.840]   I can read that for the entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Neumark Graduate School of Journalism
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:35.280]   at the City University of New York.
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:35.840]   That's the important part.
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:36.800]   That's the important part.
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:38.080]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:38.880]   It's great to have you.
[02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:40.560]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:44.400]   and Stacy already mentioned Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:45.920]   Together they make this show.
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:47.360]   I'm just the, I'm just the,
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:50.960]   me in the Jeff and Stacy sandwich.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:55.440]   I'm the Vegemite in the Stacy.
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:02.400]   Hey, don't forget we, speaking of things that are coming up,
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:05.040]   we have a wonderful event for you tomorrow.
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:07.920]   A last pass event with Steve Gibson,
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:12.000]   Jerry Bucelt, who's the CISO at LogMeIn.
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:19.920]   And my friend Andrew Keene, who is kind of a digital naysayer,
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:20.800]   they're all great.
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:23.440]   And we're going to talk about the future of identity.
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.840]   It's a special event for last pass.
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:30.400]   Now normally we'd be doing this, you know, at a venue or a theater,
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:31.760]   but obviously we're not going to do that.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:34.160]   So we're going to stream it live to you starting 1 p.m.
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:37.200]   Thursday the 14th.
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.400]   That's 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:47.280]   That's 20, 2000, 2000, 2000, 20 hours, you can see.
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:49.040]   It's going to be a fun event.
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.640]   And we will be streaming that live.
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:52.000]   There'll be an hour of conversation.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.440]   We'll also have a Twitter tag that you can use to ask questions.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:57.280]   We'll answer those questions also.
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:00.720]   And if you can't make it at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern tomorrow,
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:04.400]   please download it from the Twitter events feed.
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:06.720]   It'll be up there shortly thereafter.
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:07.680]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:11.760]   I can't wait our second last pass event, not our last.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:15.600]   We do twig this week in Google every Wednesday, 130, Pacific, 430,
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:17.600]   Eastern, 2030 UTC.
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:19.200]   Want to watch us do it live?
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:20.480]   Believe it or not, you can.
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:22.560]   All you have to do is go to twit.tv/live.
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:24.560]   There's streaming audio and video there.
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:29.200]   So you can even ask your Google or your Amazon voice assistant,
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:30.800]   "Hey, play Twit Live."
[02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:34.480]   And in most cases it'll actually just start the live stream.
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:36.080]   There's always something going on in twit.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.440]   If you're listening to the stream,
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:39.920]   you should probably be typing in the chat room,
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:43.760]   which kind of follows along at irc.twit.tv.
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:45.040]   And if you ever get a little lonely,
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:46.880]   there's somebody there 24/7,
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:49.520]   because we have listeners all over the world in every time zone.
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:51.200]   So nice people.
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:53.600]   Jeff Pockett did it.
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:58.640]   Nice people at irc.twit.tv.
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:00.960]   On-demand version of this show available on our website,

[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:09.520]   to subscribe in your favorite podcast client,
