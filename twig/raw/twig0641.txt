[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   It's time for Twig, this week in Google Stacey Ant.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.680]   And Jeff for here, we're going to talk about the year in search 2021.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.520]   What were the most popular searches in the US?
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.280]   The answers may surprise you.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.800]   Instagram says, we're going to go chronological.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.240]   As soon as we figure out how, what could be so hard?
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.800]   And watch out for the robots.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.280]   They're stuck in the snow in Estonia.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.560]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.200]   Podcasts you love.

[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.680]   Happy holidays, everybody.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.440]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we talk about the latest
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.200]   from the universe, the Google verse, the Facebook metaverse and all of the above.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.720]   Stacey, maybe, maybe that's why they named it meta.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.360]   So I would say metaverse.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.000]   Stacey Higabotham is here from Stacey on IOT.com.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.200]   Happy holidays, Stacey.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   I guess, thank you.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.720]   Santa didn't visit your house.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.400]   No, we are behind.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.360]   You can see some wrapping paper actually just behind me on the shelf.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.240]   And let's see if we can do it.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.280]   Raise the roof.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.360]   Oh, there's presents up there.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.880]   Does your daughter know that's where you store them?
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.880]   Yeah, it's real obvious.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   So that's good.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   It's wrap as you go into Stacey's house.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   I'm the other way around.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.480]   I get all the presents, make a big pile, and then wish I didn't have to wrap them on Christmas
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   Eve.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   I wasn't wrapping them.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.480]   Oh, no.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   We got everything's done.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.480]   Oh, I'm so impressed.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   I'm so impressed.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.400]   Because I'm like on it this year.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.200]   Last night, Lisa said, "Give me your laptop."
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.680]   I gave it to her.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.000]   She said, "Look at the shopping cart.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.400]   I want all that."
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.880]   This is a deal we have because I can't buy.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.040]   I don't know what to get her.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.160]   Aunt Pruitt's here from Hands On Photography, Twit.tv/HopHelloAnt.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.760]   We came up with a new thing for you to do on Windows Weekly today.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   I don't know if you heard.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.280]   Paul Thoreau was criticizing people who sent Christmas cards with pictures only of their
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   kids, not of them or pictures that are too small or bad pictures.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.840]   We thought, " Aunt should do a Christmas card picture workshop where you reviews your card
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.360]   and tells you what to fix before you mail it."
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.600]   We may need to do that.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.240]   I actually do have one now having a new finish.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   You just love giving Aunt jobs.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   I feel like he is a busy man.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   You know she's not a teeny.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.640]   You know she's something good.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.240]   Give it to someone that's busy.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   That's true.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.960]   You have a busy year all the time.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:17.600]   So with us, the Leonard Taaperfessor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:28.760]   Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.560]   Craig Newmont.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.080]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.040]   I turn my Christmas tree lights on.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.680]   I'm going to get up and I slowed down the introductions just so you can get back.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.680]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   Oh, that's so lovely.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.680]   Isn't that cute?
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.040]   Alright, next week I'll have my space decorated.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.960]   You didn't say when you looked at our set, you didn't say that's so lovely.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   Is it too much?
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   Yeah, it's too much.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   It's too much.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   It's too much.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   I'm not going to lie.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960]   I've got a very...
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   But you know where Christmas is a lot.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   But you know what?
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   Christmas is a lot.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   Yes, there's always room for one more point in zeta.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.280]   You know, that's just kind of the rule with a twist.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.640]   If you're a member of Club2it, there should be something on the Twit+ feed from yesterday.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.440]   When I said I got there for my breakfast, I said we haven't decorated this yet and I
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.240]   made Burke bring it all out and throw it on the table.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.440]   It was actually quite funny.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.040]   So he literally threw it.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.120]   He was like, "I don't give you your decorations.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.120]   Have a giant deer."
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120]   So hey...
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.680]   Is that tie fighter really a Christmas-y?
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.680]   Yes, it is.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.200]   I don't know where the tie fighter came from.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.840]   Did you put that there, Mr. Pishup came?
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   I did not.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   Okay.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   But I approve of that message.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.840]   Alright.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.000]   Is there like, is it from the Christmas episode of Star Wars?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   We do have an R2D2 we could put in there too.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   We have other somewhere.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yeah, right there, yeah.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   We have other things.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I have two points set as below me.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Stacey has one.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.400]   I'm doing very important.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.440]   I have a confession to make these our artificial points set us.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.440]   But...
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   Now you have one set.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.440]   You have your dad right there.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.240]   He's just solving that front.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   He's like...
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.520]   Hey, I got a big announcement.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.120]   I got a big announcement.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.720]   Salt hank went live today.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.960]   Salt hank, Dodge.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.960]   Yeah!
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.960]   Show the website.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.680]   I think he's done a great job.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   Look at his logo.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680]   Isn't he cute?
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   He looks like Chef...
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   What?
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.320]   Is he making kachoye pepe just free?
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   Yes.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.200]   And of course, you can't make kachoye pepe without salt.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.880]   So salt hank is my son who is now selling a premium blend of sea salt curated from around
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   the world.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   But don't worry, Jeff.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   Don't worry, Stacey.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   Don't worry that.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.880]   I'm sending him out to you.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   You don't have to get him.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.640]   But I just wanted to tell everybody...
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.640]   Look at this.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.960]   Meat hank, he really does have that mustache.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.920]   He says, "I effing love salt."
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   Right there on the webpage.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   How's his blood pressure?
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   It's fine.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   Salt's good for you.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   Nothing wrong with salt.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   I love salt.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.200]   Nothing wrong with salt.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.360]   So yeah, I'm really proud of my boy.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.120]   He's launched his salt site.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.760]   If you're looking for a gift for...
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   It's just starting.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.000]   There's only three salts right now.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.460]   The Calabrian pesto flaky sea salt blend, the essential flaky sea salt blend, or the
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.440]   truffle and garlic flaky sea salt blend.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.720]   And there's also, I think you can get all three as a package and that kind of thing.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   And look at the...
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   Let's take it off.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   Oh, you love the logo.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   Look at his...
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.720]   Look at his little face.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.720]   Isn't that cute?
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.720]   It's very chef-aware, D.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   I like it.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.160]   It is exactly what I told him.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.560]   And I also pointed out, you can never shave your mustache now, dude.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.560]   It's brand.

[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.640]   It's TikTok influenced by the world or the world by TikTok.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.160]   That's the question.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   I also--
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160]   I also--
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.160]   I also--
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.560]   The youths are influencing on TikTok and then the youths--
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.800]   Top five memes.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.920]   Number one, Bernie Sanders mittens.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.920]   Of course.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.040]   Well, we should watch TikTok for a rest of the show.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   Number two--
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.480]   I saw a wrapping paper that is just Bernie Sanders mittens.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.480]   That would be good.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.840]   Okay, I got to buy that.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   Hamster.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840]   Excellent.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.440]   I don't know why hamster.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.840]   Twisted tea, squid game, and shish.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.160]   Oh, that makes perfect sense.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   I'm still--
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.160]   Can't quite figure out Michael Jackson pronunciation.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.720]   I don't pronounce Michael Jackson.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.720]   Me?
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.600]   Anyway, we can go on number one recipe, TikTok pasta.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   That's where the feta came in.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.880]   And hamantaschen are on the list.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.680]   What is hamantaschen?
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.240]   Oh, it's a delicious cookie.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.240]   Oh, it's a delicious cookie.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.240]   Cookie for--
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.240]   I've never heard that.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   Hanukkah.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.240]   For Hanukkah, yeah.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.240]   So that's the year in search.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.640]   Watch, it's just the scratching the surface.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.040]   Google goes deep and all this.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.240]   Do they have a fancy video?
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   Yes.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   Would you like to--
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240]   It tears your heart.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   I'm reluctant to play videos.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   Do you realize?
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   Canada.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   Canada.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   Can you give us a take down for last?
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.240]   Oh, no, that was Mac Break Weekly.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   Mac Break Weekly.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:34.560]   We played Canada's tribute to-- what's his name?
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.560]   And--
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.560]   Brian Gosling?
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.560]   No.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   No.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.840]   You know, the other guy, Mint Mobile's guy.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.840]   Not quite yet.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.840]   We both did.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.840]   You're thinking we're thinking we're thinking we're thinking.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.840]   The same thing is going on.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840]   I-- Deadpool.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.840]   Anyway.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   Brian Reynolds.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.840]   Yeah, Brian Reynolds.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.840]   Not Gosling.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.840]   Yeah, that's who I meant.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.840]   Brian Reynolds.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   Thank you, each other.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   Thank you.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.000]   So Canada gave us a-- they didn't give us a take down.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.800]   They demonetized our show.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   And then--
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   And then music.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.880]   And then on Sunday, I played smoke in these meats.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.040]   And the smoke in these meats guys got mad.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.840]   So I'm not playing any Google, Year in Search.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.840]   Well, we're going to see where we get to the YouTube channel.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.320]   We're going to see how nice work Jammerby is.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.680]   Do you like-- there's Bernie, by the way.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.680]   He's joining us.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.680]   Nice work.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.680]   Yes.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.600]   Gosh, that was all the way back in January.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.480]   It's almost a year ago.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.480]   Here's the Year in Search.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   I'll play the video.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   Just no audio.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   No.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.440]   Go ahead, take us down.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.240]   This year, I'll do the narration more than ever.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.560]   The world searched.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.920]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.120]   Oh, gosh.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.280]   Will there be another lockdown?

[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:15.360]   How to be resilient?
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   How to make a comeback?
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.760]   There's Lin-Manuel Miranda on the stage of Hamilton.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.280]   There's somebody else.

[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.560]   How to be yourself?
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.040]   What is my purpose?
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.440]   Somebody won an award.

[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.680]   Somebody's given a speech where there's people.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.080]   There's power.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.880]   How to move forward.

[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.320]   Do you think it'll be upbeat as the end?
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   It can't keep us there.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.960]   Ways to help your community.

[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.160]   OK, now it's starting to cheer up.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.640]   No, it's going to-- oh, I love the poet laureate.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.760]   She was great at the inauguration.

[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.760]   Crying while they kiss babies.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.760]   Search on.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.640]   You know you're going to see this, though, on the Super Bowl
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.040]   and all the football games online.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.400]   So don't take us down.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.600]   It's like, I'm not going to see it.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.520]   You know what?
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.960]   When you're an actor, you're taught not to cry.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.960]   They always say, let the audience cry for you.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.400]   Don't cry for them.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.640]   And I feel like this was that.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.840]   This was like them crying.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.000]   Made me not-- maybe like, I'm not going to cry.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.400]   Were you touched by that?
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.080]   Yeah, I felt that.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.960]   It made me mad.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.480]   I knew I was being manipulated.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.000]   Exactly.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.480]   I was still OK.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.320]   You allowed yourself.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.200]   I felt manipulative.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.320]   I felt like it was kind of manipulative.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.200]   Some of it I felt.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.520]   And I cry at weddings, and I cry.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.120]   The commercials made me cry.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.640]   In fact, a lot of Google commercials--
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.320]   I mean, like--
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.160]   I cry at long drugs.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.000]   --is true hardship.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.600]   I mean, like Simone Biles, like, I cried, like,
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.920]   when she didn't do her routine.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.440]   I mean, like some of this, you're like--
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.240]   I can't believe it.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   --it brings back--
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.080]   There is hardship in the world.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.680]   But when Simone Biles didn't do her routine,
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.480]   it doesn't really quite like--
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.720]   OK, I thought it was a big deal.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.040]   I mean, she has worked her whole life for that.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.560]   And she is a true bad--
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.680]   Maybe I didn't know the back story.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.880]   OK.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.600]   Do this.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.640]   And if you think about what she'd overcome to be there,
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.240]   you're like--
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.120]   But wasn't the reason she couldn't do it,
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.520]   because she did so badly the day before?
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.000]   No.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.160]   No, she couldn't do it because she got basically
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.520]   the equivalent of the yips.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   But one of the--
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.520]   Yeah, because she did so badly--
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.080]   the day before.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.320]   No, that's what she did badly because she had the yips.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.960]   Oh, she had the yips and then she didn't come.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.960]   OK.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.720]   And then also, just think about this, Leo.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.480]   She was one of, however, 20 gymnasts who were sexually
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.240]   assaulted--
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.360]   Through that, I understand.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.280]   --for years, they're all in that always--
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.720]   You think that was part of the head all the time?
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.040]   Oh, OK.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.080]   OK, if that was part of it--
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.640]   I mean--
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.280]   Wow.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.160]   Well, I think it's going to always be part of her.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:17.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.280]   But all of a sudden, that day on the Olympics,
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.280]   you think that was why?
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.960]   I think when you're like big pressure cooker
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.160]   and you get worried and then move with that--
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.280]   I'm not--
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.280]   And then--
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.280]   And then--
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.600]   You know, I'm sympathetic and certainly she
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.680]   should take the day off if she's upset.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.760]   Didn't bother me.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.720]   I'm not sure it made me-- brought me to tears.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   But--
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.560]   And that's--
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.080]   I mean, like as someone who pushes through mental illness
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.600]   or stress to the detriment of myself, I was really proud of it.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   That was a hard step for the head.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.200]   That she did that.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:50.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.200]   All right.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.760]   That's going to affect different people
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.960]   because it depends on your own personal story.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.760]   There are some people just like Ms. Stacey said.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.760]   They have their own personal battles
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.000]   when it comes to mental health and they understand
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.800]   the struggles from day to day to keep pushing through.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.200]   I understand that.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.400]   All right, I don't want to be--
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.600]   I'm not a static or anything.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.200]   No, no, you're not-- I'm not saying that.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.840]   I was a move to tears by your not showing.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.240]   I'm just going to be like--
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.120]   I could see why you wouldn't be moved to tears
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.560]   because you're not in that same space as some of the other folks.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.200]   Makes sense.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.520]   OK, well, that was fun.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.720]   Way to bring us down.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   I really thought Google would--
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.360]   I thought Google would do the arc and start
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.440]   like being really upbeat.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.080]   But no, they just were like--
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.440]   Actually, yeah, the sheer was not upbeat.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.120]   Wasn't a good year.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.520]   You were fine.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.440]   I mean, we got the vaccine, but then we didn't all
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.400]   use the vaccine.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.040]   So then there's back here.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.200]   And I mean, here we are still debating like--
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.680]   There's still a debate on safety and all that stuff.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.160]   But yet people will choose to do a bunch of weird stunts.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.120]   And I don't get it.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.600]   But that's just me.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.640]   People.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.600]   People are weird.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.600]   Anyway.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.600]   [BEEPING]
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.800]   You've got tons of stuff here, boss.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.400]   Tugs.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:11.760]   Really?
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.200]   Do.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.840]   Although so much of it is like not--
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.520]   so much of it feels like Jeff put it on the list.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.520]   I wonder why.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.520]   Wow.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.520]   Adam, I heard--
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.800]   I was major.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.040]   I told you so opportunity.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.560]   We'll get there.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.000]   We'll get there.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.840]   We'll get there.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.000]   Adam Moserie says Instagram is going
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.720]   to bring back a chronological feed next year.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.160]   All right.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.880]   I don't understand why they've been working
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.320]   on a version of the feature for months.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.080]   What?
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:39.800]   Well, it's so hard.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.840]   It's so hard about bringing a--
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.680]   You just do it in the order they were posted.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.520]   Data comes in.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.000]   Data goes out, right?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   I--
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.920]   Well, they were coming for months.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.880]   Leo, I saw what it took for you to do bingo.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.320]   This is stuff is where it was coming.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.160]   Bingo is a hard day to say.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.720]   But even then, it only took me an evening.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   Not months.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.960]   Not months.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.520]   After more than five years-- OK, I didn't realize this.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.840]   Instagram hasn't had a chronological feed for five years.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.480]   And this is my argument boy against Facebook too,
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.040]   is you join these things thinking
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.480]   you're going to see the people you followed in order of the posts
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.440]   they make.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.840]   And in fact, you're subtly being manipulated.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.080]   And they happens everywhere because we're
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.520]   talking about my son and his TikToks.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.160]   I don't see his TikToks.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.640]   I follow him.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.160]   Right.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:38.680]   Same here.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.360]   But they're algorithmically nudged out of the way
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.040]   for something else.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.720]   I get notifications for his videos
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.280]   this like three days after he posted it.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.240]   It's sort of weird.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.600]   I think it's interesting that this is such a challenge.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.640]   What this is because--
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.440]   Because TikTok too specifically is that when I go to the salt
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.480]   hank, it doesn't have the latest on top, which
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.480]   is the way we think of all the web algorithms.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.800]   They're pushing on top.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.600]   Algorithms, yeah.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.760]   Adam Oseri, head of Instagram.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.440]   Not the founder.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.880]   Remember Kevin Sistrom and company
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.800]   left after a while at Facebook thinking
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.160]   they just-- and we don't like what they're doing.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.720]   Oseri, who's a Facebook guy who was moved into Instagram.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.400]   He was in charge of the news feed before.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.400]   Yeah, which was also not chronological, I might add.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.000]   We're currently working on a version
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.880]   of a chronological feed that we--
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.840]   a version of does not mean chronological.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.240]   All right.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.560]   I just want to say this.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.400]   There's not a version of Monday through Friday.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.240]   There's Monday through Friday.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.200]   Chronological--
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.480]   I like to skip Wednesday myself.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.400]   It's rigid.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.080]   Can you twig down?
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.840]   You want to skip it?
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.640]   Hey.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.600]   Chronological is rigid.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.360]   It is in order of presentation.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.000]   And what does a version of chronological mean?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.360]   It's not chronological.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.360]   That's what it means.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.680]   Maybe Tuesday through Monday is chronological versus Monday
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.320]   through Sunday.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:01.960]   I don't know.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.480]   Maybe they throw the big things in there just in case.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.040]   Talk about rationalization.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.200]   In June, Moserri wrote in a blog post that--
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.480]   here's the problem, he said, with a chronological feed.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.880]   Quote, "It makes it impossible for most people
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.320]   to see everything, let alone the posts they care about.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.120]   Putting them in order would make it hard for you
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.280]   to see everything you care about."
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.080]   That's bull.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.840]   You follow who you follow.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.120]   That's self-serving.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.760]   It's like, no, no, no.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.800]   You care about what we tell you to care about, buddy.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.840]   Well, I'm sorry, but I'm on a devil's advocate here.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.080]   If you look at the numbers of how many posts,
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.640]   there is stuff that you might like to get to you won't get to.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.120]   I mean, say we have to be on Twitter.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.840]   Now that it says 109 tweets above, I know I'm missing--
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.840]   Well, you kind of controlled that, though,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.440]   because you're following more people than you can see.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.400]   So you could, if you said, no, I want
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.320]   to be able to see everything say, well, I'm only going to follow
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:25:59.600]   five.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.680]   Well, that's why I use a list.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.600]   Then I use a list.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.880]   Yeah, but I mean, that's up to you.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.720]   He's saying, well, people follow so many people
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.200]   that we have to massage their feeds
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.480]   so that they see everything they care about,
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.560]   even though I'm sending them a very direct signal of what
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.120]   I care about.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.120]   I care about these feeds.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.400]   So this is just, to me, self-serving.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.120]   We know why they have an algorithm.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.840]   And it has nothing to do with--
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.120]   Why do they have an algorithm?
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120]   Can make money.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.200]   Oh, OK.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.480]   To make it sticky.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.840]   But that's why you should be in business, too, right?
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.240]   To make money.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.840]   OK, that's exactly the--
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.480]   In a nutshell, you've just explained the problem right there,
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.720]   which is these companies are constituted for profits
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   over people.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.680]   They want to make money, and they
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.080]   are using non-cronological algorithmic feeds
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.240]   because it keeps you there longer.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.520]   And then you see more ads, and they make more money,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.680]   not because that's what people want.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.880]   They're not doing what you want.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.800]   They're doing what they want, make more money,
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.440]   by making it sticky.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.480]   Can I just say that I was very impressed
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.800]   that no fewer than three senators' offices created fake
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:17.160]   Instagram accounts for teenage girls?
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.640]   What?
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.000]   Senator Blumenthal, Senator Blackburn, and Senator Michael
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.760]   Lee.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.960]   They all created--
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.240]   More creepy about this, too.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.800]   But keep me going.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.760]   What?
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.240]   I added the hearings.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.280]   They all created these accounts to try to understand
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.760]   how everything worked.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.760]   Finster accounts?
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   They--
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   What's a fix?
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.760]   You say, but I thought this is kind of refreshing.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.800]   And I'm sure a staffer told them to do it.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:51.000]   But I remember in 2008, sitting through some of the Google
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.720]   hearings-- oh my goodness, this little Leo thing.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.320]   What is happening?
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.680]   And Jeremy is killing it in the tricaster.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.000]   I love it.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.840]   This is great.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.680]   Anyway, they created way back in 2008,
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.200]   when we were talking about Google search and harm.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.240]   It was ad-polic.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.760]   It was actually tracking.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.080]   And they were like, well, I couldn't understand that if I
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.280]   searched this, you actually keep that information
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.360]   like they were shot.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.240]   But now they're actively trying to engage in the platforms
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.360]   to understand how they work, which--
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.840]   you know, I'm glad.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.720]   I appreciate that.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.840]   That's progress.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.640]   So that's progress.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.600]   I feel like it is.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.640]   It sounds creepy.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.040]   But I think we should explain why they created Teenage Girl
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.920]   accounts on Instagram.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.560]   Blumenthal said, the office created a fake Instagram account
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.120]   to pose as a 13-year-old girl to research what the app is
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.040]   like for teens and how it could affect their mental health.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.440]   Because we've all seen the studies.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.160]   And she's back when this was in the news--
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.400]   Francis Hoggins, Whistleblower--
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.960]   that Facebook knew and Instagram knew,
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.120]   Instagram particularly knew that it was making young girls--
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.480]   some percentage of young girls feel bad about themselves.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.040]   Bloomberg Thal said that during their protecting kids online,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.720]   this is exactly when he also talked about Finstas.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.400]   Our research has shown in real-time Instagram's recommendations,
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.880]   this is Blumenthal talking, "We'll latch onto a person's
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.440]   insecurities, a young woman's vulnerabilities
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.360]   about their bodies and drag them into dark places
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.080]   that glorify eating disorders and self-harm."
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.800]   I wonder how he knew--
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.400]   I hope he had some expertise.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.360]   Some experts come in, Dana Boyd or somebody come in and say,
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.840]   yeah, let me show you what a 13-year-old girl's account
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   would be.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.960]   Because it's not one of his--
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.720]   I'm sure one of his staffers had a kid,
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.880]   and they were like, OK, go.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.600]   He said, "Within a day of creating the account,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.640]   the platform began serving the fake account known as a Finsta,
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.240]   content promoting eating disorders and self-harm."
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.840]   I'd like to know what that is.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.480]   I didn't say, oh, you should try throwing up after you eat.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.240]   Much more likely, he's interpreting--
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   I get a lot.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.240]   Do you?
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   No, well, I get a lot of things that are very, like,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.240]   disordered eating kind of posts.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   So I get a lot of weird-- I bet it's bad diets.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   OK.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   How about self-harm?
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   What would it post be encouraging self-harm?
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   How would that even manifest?
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   Yeah, I don't know about that.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   I mean, but you could see girls talking about struggles
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.240]   with that, or I mean, there's a lot of--
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.240]   I don't know if this matters, Stacey,
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.240]   but is this in reels that you're seeing it,
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   or is this just the actual--
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   Oh, sorry, this isn't TikTok.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   I'm not-- I don't do Instagram.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:45.240]   On TikTok, I get a lot of things like, only eat this for losing this.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   And what's scary is, because I follow things that my daughters
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   interested in.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   I'm half 15-year-old girl to these things, and I'm half--
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240]   Oh.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   Actually, I think suddenly, a menopausal 55-year-old woman.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.240]   Actually, they're eating disorders on both ends.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.240]   So I'm just like, "Dane."
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   Because I get posts talking about eating this and eating that,
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   but these are all professional athletes that would, you know,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   follow in diet plans and things of that nature.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.240]   Oh, a lot of the advertising on these sites,
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.240]   all these sites are diet supplements, protein, powder,
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.240]   you know, tiger, milk, everything, or special teas that help you
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   burn fat, that kind of thing.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.240]   It's the early days of newspapers of magazine.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   Is that considered disorder?
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.240]   It's like the Joe Weeder magazine in the back of the magazine, right?
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   Is that considered eating disorders, though?
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   No, I mean, that's what I'm asking.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   No, just like it's-- I get some that are, like, nutritionists,
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   but then I get a lot of, like, juice cleanses, which I do think of
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   as disorder eating.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   A cleanser is what I get a lot of.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:52.240]   My own personal trainer and his wife told me the other day,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.240]   "Yeah, we take a pill that makes everything go through you."
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.240]   I said, "I got some gummy bears in here.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.240]   You don't need to take a pill."
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   I got, "Let me make you a pot of coffee."
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   He fixed that.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   And then, and then he said, "Now we're on the other pill that is--"
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   "Clenses are just BS, but a lot of normal people believe them.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.240]   It's not disordered eating."
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.240]   I know, but I also get, like, intermittent fasting
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   that's pretty extreme.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   I get things like--
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   Yeah, I was doing that.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   How did it, like, I get tons of, "This is what I eat in a day."
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   And some of them are totally normal, and some of them are, like,
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.240]   a woman who's, like, my age, my size.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.240]   This is what I-- this is how to eat 1,200 calories in a day.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   And I'm sorry, you should not try--
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.240]   No, no.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   1,200 calories in a day if you're, like--
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   That's not even breakfast.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.240]   Okay, well, it's more than breakfast for me, but yeah.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   [laughter]
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   I was like, "That's like breakfast, and--
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.240]   How many eggs do you eat?"
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   There's minimum six eggs.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.240]   Oh, my God.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   Minimum six eggs.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.240]   And you eat the yolks and the whites.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   Of course.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.240]   Hell yeah.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   [laughter]
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   Did him raw?
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   No, you can--
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   No.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   No, no.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   Because Rocky, we eat raw fruits and--
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   He doesn't even chew.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   The whole egg just goes down.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   He's, like, cast on.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.240]   [laughter]
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   Um, okay, I don't know.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   You know, yeah, yeah, I'm--
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   There's also a lot of, like, how to keep your eggs
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   up while only eating, like, X number of calories a day,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.240]   which I am, like, a girl.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.240]   I had a cubano sandwich, and I can't keep my energy up, so I don't--
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.240]   [laughter]
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   I don't know.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.240]   I think you can eat too much, too.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240]   I think that's also possible.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.240]   It's true to sugar crash.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.240]   Um, all right, Jeff, you said there's a lot of good stuff in here.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.240]   Give me one.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.240]   Can I-- can I-- can I say I told you so?
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.240]   Oh, yeah, actually hold that.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.240]   Hold that thought, 'cause if I'm gonna get beat up,
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.240]   I better do an ad first.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.240]   [laughter]
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.240]   Let's pay the bills.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.240]   Better fill some money in your pocket.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.240]   Why am I going through this?
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.240]   Hold that's right.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   I got-- I got the salt to buy.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   [laughter]
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.240]   This is expensive salt, I gotta say.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.240]   I hope-- I hope you're getting a wholesale price from salt hank.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.240]   No, actually, I'm an investor.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   'Cause he had a-- he had a-- oh, my God.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.240]   Am I sitting behind myself?
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   That's for sure.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.240]   [laughter]
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.240]   Um, nicely done, Jim and B.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   [laughter]
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.240]   Nicely done.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.240]   [laughter]
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   If you're not watching the video, well, you're missing all the fun,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   that's all I can say.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   There's like a Leo Elf on the shelf.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   There's an Elf on the shelf.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.240]   Wow.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.240]   Nicely done.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.240]   Good old Tri-Casto magic.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   It's kind of mesmerizing.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.240]   It is.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.240]   It is.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   It's the Leo as bettronome.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:39.240]   And I have gone ahead and ordered some salt even though you sent--
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   You don't have to.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   No, even though you sent some--
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.240]   You are.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.240]   I want to support him.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   Thank you.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   You know.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   Well, I think, you know, get out there.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   You might-- you might sell out if you don't hurry.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   [laughter]
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.240]   Um, you know, it's exciting.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   It's really nice to see your--
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   Yeah, wait, wait.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.240]   Are you shopping while on the show?
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.240]   [laughter]
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.240]   I did it.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   I started ordering right when he-- right when he pulled up the website,
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.240]   I started ordering.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.240]   I was like, yeah, I want to support him.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   Aw, thank you.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   You give me--
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.240]   Our show today brought to you by--
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.240]   And then we're going to hear Jeff tell me so.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   Userway.org.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   Actually, this is something I think at this holiday season we can all get behind.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.240]   Every website without exception is a public entity.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   That means it has to be accessible to people with disabilities.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   And it's-- you know, I mean, there's three reasons you do this.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.240]   One is the law.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.240]   Americans with Disabilities Act requires it.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.240]   You can get sued for it.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.240]   In fact, a very well-known pizza company in the United States took it all away to the Supreme Court.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   I've said this before.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   They had a phone number.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240]   They said, well, we got a phone number.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   If you're blind, just call the phone number and we'll get you your pizza.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   And the Supreme Court said, no, that's separate but equal.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   You're a public entity.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   You have to be accessible.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   That's one reason.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.240]   Other reason is it's the right thing to do, right?
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.240]   Make your site accessible.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   Third reason, profit.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   If you aren't accessible, you're leaving 60 million Americans with disabilities out in the cold.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   They can't buy your salt.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.240]   They can't-- they can't shop.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   They can't participate.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   They can't fill out forms.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   Userway solves all that.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   And it doesn't vary affordably.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   You know, as a website owner myself, I was always nervous about this because, ah, this is going to cost a lot.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.240]   It's going to be a lot of work.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.240]   I'm going to have to hire developers.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   Userway has an incredible AI-powered solution that tirelessly information
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   and tirelessly enforces hundreds of web access guidelines, content access guidelines, with one line of JavaScript.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   It can achieve more.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   Userway can achieve more than an entire team of developers.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.240]   You don't have to be overwhelmed.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   You can make your website accessible easily, affordably.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   In fact, first thing you should probably do is go to userway.org/twit
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   and they have a free scanning tool to see if your website's ADA compliant.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   Probably isn't.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   But, you know, maybe it is.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   Maybe it is.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.240]   Maybe you did the right thing.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   Good.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.240]   But if not, check out Userway.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   Userway's AI and machine learning solutions, power accessibility for so much of the web.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:14.240]   Over a million websites, Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, Walmart, and on and on and on.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.240]   Userway, just, but, and you might say, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.240]   I'm not Disney.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   I can't afford this."
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240]   No, no.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   Userway is making its best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available for a very affordable price to small and medium sized businesses.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.240]   Operating an accessible and compliant website, it's the right thing to do.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.240]   It just makes business sense.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   And when you need to scale, "Hey, if it's good enough for Disney and Walmart, you're going to be able to scale.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.240]   Don't worry about it."
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:48.240]   For years, Userway has been on the cutting edge, creating innovative accessibility technologies to push the envelope of what's possible.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:55.240]   With AI, machine learning, computer vision, Userway's AI automatically fixes violations.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:38:02.240]   At the code level, they actually are working on what's called the accessibility layer of your browser.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.240]   Everybody's browser has an accessibility layer.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   You don't normally see it.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   If you're blind, if you're using a screen reader, that's what your screen reader sees.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   And that's what Userway writes to it.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.240]   Automatically generates image aunts.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.240]   So it writes those alt tags for you.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.240]   That's where the AI and the image recognition comes in.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   It'll fix complex nav menus.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.240]   I hear from people all the time that that's a real problem for screen readers.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.240]   It's a real Achilles heel.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.240]   All your pop-ups are accessible.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.240]   All your forms are accessible.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.240]   It fixes vague link violations, fixes any broken links.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   And it puts users in control because they can customize your website to make it work for them.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.240]   Works with everything.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   Wordpress Shopify Wix, AEM Site Course SharePoint integrates seamlessly.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   It's easy to add Userway.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.240]   It'll help your business meet its compliance goals.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.240]   It'll improve the experience from your users.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   Just ask Susan Bennett, the former Voice of Siri, the world's most popular assistant.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   What do you think, Susan?
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   Hi, I'm Susan Bennett, the original Voice of Siri.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   You won't hear me say something like this too often.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.240]   I don't understand what you're looking for.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   But every day, that's what the Internet is like for millions of people with disabilities.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.240]   Userway fixes all of that with just one line of code.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:30.240]   Userway can make any website fully accessible, fully ADA compliant.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.240]   With Userway, everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly, can customize it.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:39.240]   It's also a great way to show your commitment to millions of people with disabilities.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.240]   Go to userway.org/twit.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   U-S-E-R-W-A-Y, userway.org/twit.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   Actually, we've got 30% off for you on their AI powered accessibility solution.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   That's even more affordable.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.240]   Userway, making the Internet accessible for everyone.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   Userway.org/twit.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.240]   We thank you so much for supporting this week in Google.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.240]   All right, Jeff.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:11.240]   Last week, when we were last here, we had a discussion about Twitter's new rule that
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.240]   was going to be in the middle of the day.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   We had a discussion about the Internet accessible for everyone.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.240]   We had a discussion about the Internet accessible for everyone.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   We had a discussion about the Internet accessible for everyone.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.240]   We had a discussion about the Internet accessible for everyone.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.240]   We had a discussion about the Internet accessible for everyone.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   We had a discussion about the Internet accessible for everyone.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.240]   You're a fool, Jeff.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   You think that all the time?
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   No, I don't.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   I was hopeful.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:56.240]   I understood what you're saying, but I was hopeful that A, Twitter would enforce it appropriately
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.240]   so that there was enough room in there that they could make it work.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.240]   But obviously, people are already using it.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.240]   Right, so what happened was the far right has weaponized it.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   And is going after anything that might criticize them and taking down stuff and putting up all
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.240]   kinds of false reports and doing all kinds of things.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:19.240]   And so, my argument stands well-intentioned but unintended consequences.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   Here's an example from --
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   Twitter said that they're going to be looking at this.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think they could fix it.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   Yeah, they started taking down some of those who were abusing it, but it took a couple of days
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.240]   and a lot of researchers yelling at them.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.240]   Again, I like Twitter.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.240]   I think Twitter is doing the right thing.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.240]   I mean, I think it's --
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.240]   Here's an example.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.240]   How democracy works.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.240]   Right.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.240]   I thought this was going to be part of the process to begin.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.240]   Yeah, and I think they quoted it in such a way that it gives them the tools they need to
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.240]   take care of it.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.240]   This is an example that was given by a CNN business.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.240]   This is the article you're referring to.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:56.880]   In January, Samuel Braslow was covering an anti-mask protest at a Los Angeles mall for the Beverly
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.240]   Hills Courier, 56-year-old local newspaper where he's a reporter.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:07.240]   During the event, he tweeted a video of a standoff between anti-maskers and a mall official.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.520]   You see that a lot these days.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.360]   This week, this is back in January he did this.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.120]   Someone filed a report caused Twitter to lock down his account.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:22.400]   The complaint led to him being unable to tweet until he either successfully appealed
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.680]   or reported to lead old tweets.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.160]   He was stuck.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.480]   Now, this is -- I don't know what's happened since then, but yeah, that's exactly the
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.480]   unintended consequences you were talking about.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.480]   The Guardian has the latest story.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.480]   That's the one on top where this is happening.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:42.480]   Twitter has said, "Uh-oh, we got used."
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:47.200]   They've got a -- so a statement Twitter made said an internal review of the policy after
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.480]   making several errors in enforcement.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.480]   Well, if you have a bad point, you could have -- I mean --
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   That does reflect poorly on them because you could see that was going to happen.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.480]   Oh, damn.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.480]   They should have been ready for it.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.880]   After this roll, we became aware of a significant amount of coordinated and malicious reports
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.480]   and unfortunately our enforcement team has made several errors.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   I'm shocked.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.480]   Malicious people on the Internet?
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   How could that happen?
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   That's what I said is they didn't think of far enough ahead with those things.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   So you said I was a fool.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.480]   No, I didn't say that.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   No, we didn't say that.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.480]   I said, and I think it's still true.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.480]   I'll stand by it.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   The policy as they stated gives them enough leeway to handle this properly.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.480]   What they did wrong was they just kind of need your pull down these accounts.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.480]   Well, they also didn't write it well enough.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   Didn't write it well.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.480]   No, no, no.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   This is the way -- no, no, no.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   You're trying to use us here.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.480]   You can't do that.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   And people managed to get through it.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   So they'll figure it out.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   But there's a lot of -- I told you so.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.480]   It was going around the Internet this last week, including right.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   I think, Jeff, this is moral panic on your part.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   It is yet to become -- look, there's going to be some --
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.480]   It's not a problem.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.480]   It's just a problem.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   Nobody said this would be perfect.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   But I think that -- we'll see.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   Let's look in a couple of weeks or a couple of months and see how this is paying out.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.480]   I think it was really important that Twitter took a stand on this stuff and said, you know,
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   this is -- they hadn't even admitted it was a problem.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   No.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.480]   So to admit that it was a problem and say, look, we're going to do something about this is
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   exactly the right direction.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:21.480]   Maybe it needs some refinement, probably more likely in these less automated takedowns.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.480]   But that's a problem on -- you know, I was just talking about that on YouTube.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   I think these were human takedowns, but they were interpreting.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   Well, they need to then, you know, train people better, obviously.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.480]   So anyway, that was --
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   Thank you.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   Let's see if they fix it.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   Let's see if they fix it.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   And if not, then they got a problem.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   You're absolutely right.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:48.480]   But anything Twitter does, you know, Twitter has also been used and you've been the victim
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.480]   of it for abuse.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   So I think anything Twitter does to kind of counter abuse is a good thing.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   I agree.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   I agree.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.480]   They just could have done it better.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   That's all.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   All right.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   Do better, Twitter.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   Do better.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.480]   I'm watching.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   Much of the World Championship match, you know, is going downhill fast.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   And there was a press conference yesterday.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   World Championship match in --
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.480]   What sport?
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   What sport?
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   What other sport is there?
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.480]   Okay.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   I thought you were talking about F1, maybe the car is full of playoffs.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.480]   Or --
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.480]   Magnus Carlson, the World Champion, was so friendly by a question at the press conference, he
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.480]   says, "Do better."
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   Wow.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   I want that meme.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.480]   I respect that.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   Do better.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.480]   I respect that.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.480]   He says, "We get this question every World Championship.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.480]   It's a BS question.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   Do better."
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.480]   Yeah, I respect that.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   Wow.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   I wish there were more journalistic approach out there when doing these little post-cuff -- post-sporting
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   event interviews.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.480]   You rarely hear --
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   How do you feel about this big win?
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   I feel like crap.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480]   Is that what they're --
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   But I also say it goes both ways, because athletes are not notoriously forthcoming at
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.480]   these interviews.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.480]   I came to play.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   I played 100%.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   We came to win.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   We're going to win.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   It's not always very interesting.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   We just scored on more points than the other teams.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   To the team.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   You know, I found that the team that scores the most points often wins these games.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   Yeah, allegedly.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   Allegedly.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.480]   Unless it's American democracy.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.480]   Hey, here's a good -- here's a good feel-good story.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:23.480]   Tim Nick Gebru, who was hired by Google to run their ethics division, then fired when she
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   said things they didn't like, has started her own AI research center.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   Two, I think this is important to ask questions about the responsible use of artificial intelligence.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.480]   That was kind of what she was supposed to be doing at Google.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   But they didn't really want her to do that, apparently.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.480]   So that's good news.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   I'm not surprised.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   She's the founder and executive director of distributed artificial intelligence research
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   there.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   With lots of funding from lots of places.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.480]   Good.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   The first part of the name is a reference to her aim to be more inclusive than most AI labs.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   That's where the distributed comes in, which is Q, of course, white, western and male.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.480]   And recruit people from parts of the world rarely represented in the tech industry.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   Nobody better to do that.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480]   That's great.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.480]   Glad to hear that.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   So, see, there's happy news.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.480]   Yes.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:19.480]   There will also work on demonstrating uses for AI unlikely to be developed elsewhere.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   Gabriel says, aiming to inspire others to take technology in new directions.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.480]   This is one of the really strong arguments for diversity.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   You get a kind of a monolithic group of people doing it.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   They're all going to do the same kind of stuff.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.480]   Here's an example.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.480]   A homogenous.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.480]   That's exactly one such project creating a public data set of aerial imagery of the
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   South Africa to examine how the legacy of apartheid is still etched into land use.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.480]   Interesting.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.480]   So.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.480]   Good going.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   Happy news.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.480]   And then there's the Estonian robots.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.480]   Well, I don't know if I put this in the rundown.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.480]   Stacy, you may think it's one of those crazy things that Jeff put in the rundown.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.480]   I thought it was a nice one.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   I thought this was fun.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:16.480]   I saw this and they thought about my chat with Miss Stacy about the Murderbot book series.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.480]   It's on my screen.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   She thought it was cute that I thought I could take out a Murderbot and I said, "All I need is a hose."
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.480]   That's all I need.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:31.480]   And this right here is these little things you see them all actually in the US too on college campuses.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:36.480]   They're little food delivery bots and they're bunching San Francisco at one time.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   And actually there's always on TikTok funny little videos of them getting stalled and stuff.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:47.480]   But here's about, I don't know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven of them stuck in the snow.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.480]   Stuck in the snow.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   They just can't.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.480]   They just can't put it.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.480]   The biggest story it would have bought up with a snow tire is by the way.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   You can see the wheel spinning.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   Try and go in and go in.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   This is the one in the front that's here.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.480]   He's giving up.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.480]   He's just like, "I give up.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:00.480]   I can't miss my robot."
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.480]   It's like this is the next generation's children's stories right here.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   Like the little engine that goes to the robot.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:12.480]   It had to make, it's like, "Baltow meets the little engine that could."
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.480]   There we go.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.480]   What I like too is they're going opposite directions.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.480]   They kind of meet and say, "Are you screwed?"
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   "Yeah, I'm screwed."
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   Yeah, I'm screwed.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   Somebody's not getting their submarine sandwich.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.480]   On the other hand, you know what they need?
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.480]   They need some Macaques.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.480]   Monkeys?
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   You watch that video?
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.480]   Oh, is that the one right below it?
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.480]   Is that how you say that monkey name?
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.480]   Yeah, Macaques.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:35.480]   These are the Macaques of Valley.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:41.480]   They've learned to steal valuables from tourists and then trade it back for food.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.480]   They don't want the backpack.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   They want the food.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   So he demonstrates in here.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.480]   It almost was like Brian Regan standing there.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   Sorry.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.480]   If you go along for a few minutes, it goes for a while.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   But he goes along.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   He gets the monkey to steal his phone and then he negotiates with it.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   So the monkey's--
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   He goes what the monkey will take.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   Oh, she just stole--
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.480]   That was me.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.480]   The poor little girl, she's got two shoes.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.480]   One steals one shoe and the other one steals the other one.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.480]   They like ganged up on her.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.480]   Holy cow, look at this.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.480]   I'm not digging this.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.480]   A sunglasses?
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.480]   The monkey would have a--
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.480]   Now, they don't really need sunglasses or shoes, I hear.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.480]   Oh, well.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   No.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   No.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.480]   So, um--
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.480]   He's got a pussy out from us.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:33.480]   A.M. Espin of BBC Two is going to explain--
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.480]   Is there not audio on this, John?
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.480]   I can-- I can--
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.480]   Here, you do it.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.480]   But you got to do it in a ponzi British accent.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.480]   Ponzi British accent?
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.480]   Yeah, here you go.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.480]   So then I put it on my shades and there's a phone here.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.480]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   Okay, he's got my phone.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.480]   And there is a system by which I may be able to do this.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   Bartry, an egg?
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   Is there a school--
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.480]   Is there a school, a BBC reporter's school where they teach them how to--
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.480]   Look, he got his phone back.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.480]   No.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.480]   Okay, I--
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.480]   He's terrible negotiation.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.480]   I think that's not--
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.480]   Yeah, that's not good.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:08.480]   I think that's an example of an anthropologist who knows what he's doing.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.480]   Hey, congratulations to our own Congress member, Devin Nunes, who has decided to--
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   [laughter]
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.480]   --abandoned Congress, wasn't working out that well for him.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.480]   So, it's a good question.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   And his constituency is to run-- this is going to work out great--
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   Trump's new media company.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.480]   Oh, boy.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.480]   He'll be the CEO.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.480]   What is the name?
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   Do we have a name?
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.480]   The Trump Media and Technology Group.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.480]   [laughter]
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.480]   That's a good name.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.480]   Okay.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   Okay.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   Is this the-- is this the-- whatever happened to the Trump Twitter?
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.480]   That's what this is.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.480]   Is that what this is?
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   Okay.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.480]   This is the SPAC.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.480]   It's like $1.8 billion.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.480]   It's all just shady as shady can be.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.480]   Before Nunes, the company released the full names of just two top employees, Donald J--
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.480]   one Donald J. Trump and streaming content executive Scott St. John.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.480]   Oh, boy.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.480]   Now they've got-- now-- and then there were three.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.480]   So, anyway, congratulations.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.480]   It's not up, though, right?
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.480]   You can't-- can you--
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.480]   No.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   No, all right.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   I don't think it's ever going to go up.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.480]   No.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.480]   [laughter]
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   --a political--
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.480]   That's where narcissists just have to stay relevant.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.480]   --stay relevant.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   --and raise your money.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.480]   These are all Jeff Jarvis's stories.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.480]   I just want you to know.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.480]   Okay.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   "Politico slammed for inventing a disease."
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:40.480]   News reports that Kamala Harris is Bluetooth-phobic for not using Bluetooth.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   Remember, Hillary Clinton got in trouble for using her own email server?
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.480]   Harris does not want to use-- and she's right.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.480]   Good.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.480]   --a phone with Bluetooth because it's not secure.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   Yes.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:56.480]   Well, now she's Bluetooth-phobic according to Politico.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.480]   "Politico's bad."
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   I'm hating people throwing this term around.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   Why is that a story?
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.480]   I mean, it's--
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   Amen.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:08.480]   Because if they're sexist, right-wing bros, that's why.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.480]   The December 6 story says, quote, "While a growing number of consumers are going wireless,
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.480]   the vice president is sticking with the classics.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   She's long felt that Bluetooth headphones are a security risk as a result."
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.480]   Silly her.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   Silly.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:29.480]   As a result, Harris insists on using wired headphones.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.480]   Wow.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.480]   Good for her.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.480]   What a horrible person.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.480]   The reason is--
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.480]   The reason is--
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.480]   --every girl in the road is--
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:41.480]   --the road is where she's getting the phone that has a headphone jack because I'd like to know.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.480]   Oh, you're not going to find that out.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.480]   Oh, man.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   You're not going to find that out.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   The battle between Roku and Google--
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   Good stuff, right?
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   --is over for now anyway.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   Roku has become so big that it's able to finally say no to companies that are over a zealous in their contracts with Roku.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:13.480]   For a while, it looked like Google's YouTube and YouTube TV would not be on Roku, which would be a big deal.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   I mean, for Roku users.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.480]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.480]   I use Roku.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.480]   I do too.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.480]   Yep.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.480]   And I use YouTube TV.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.480]   I really like it.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.480]   Roku's deal was set to expire this month.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   Roku warned customers in April that YouTube TV maybe forced off the platform.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.480]   Roku said it was-- they were asking for too much data about customers.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.480]   Google was also threatening to make the YouTube app unavailable.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.480]   That was the escalation, right?
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.480]   Well, you're not going to use YouTube TV, which is our money maker.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:50.480]   We're not going to let you use YouTube either.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.480]   Actually, YouTube TV was removed from Roku's store for five months.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:58.480]   I didn't notice that because they didn't delete it from-- I still had it on my Roku, but I guess new people couldn't download it.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:11.480]   At the heart of these conflicts, allegations from Roku Google was making any competitive demands as part of its distribution agreements, including preferential treatment of its YouTube TV and YouTube apps within the Roku system.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.480]   Roku did not back down for months.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.480]   Google publicly denied the allegations.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:26.480]   CNBC a couple of months ago said we saw an email that said YouTube executives-- actually, an email that was from YouTube executives actually making those exact demands in 2019.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.480]   Axios-- this is from the Axios stories.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.480]   Yeah, it takes publicly denied.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   We've seen that email and can confirm the contents in any event.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   This is not the end of these battles, not just with Roku, but with all of these devices.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:48.480]   And services like Hulu, YouTube TV has its own negotiation issues with locals and the cable channels.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   They're all battling because there's a lot of money.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.480]   Yeah, I was going to say everybody's got to make a buck.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   Gotta make a problem.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   Bumblers.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.480]   Bumblers.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   Gotta make a buck.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   Bumblers.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.480]   Gotta bundle.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   Okay, was that all of your stories, Jeff?
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.480]   That was-- I actually put that in there.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   He didn't put that in there.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   Oh, good man.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.480]   No.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:16.480]   Did you put-- I put it in something for Stacy, but she doesn't like what I put in here, so I'm not going to mention it.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:17.480]   Well, what is it?
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   Let me just look through.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.480]   Normally, I see a little time.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.480]   I don't know.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.480]   It says "very IOT" down at line 152.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.480]   I thought it was IOT-ish.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.480]   I thought this would be an interesting question.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   Okay, if you think I get all the way down to line 152--
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   --very IOT.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.480]   Seeking a common language--
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.480]   This is when you say "bless his heart."
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.480]   For self-drive.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   Press your card.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.480]   Press your card.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.480]   So this actually--
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.480]   Was it raised by a southern woman?
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   It was just raised in the south.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   This actually is interesting because one of the promises of self-driving cars is that they will talk to each other in their auto communication.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.480]   That would help you all arrive at a stop sign.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:56.480]   The cars can say, "After you have fawns," that kind of thing.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.480]   But it's very IOT-ish.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.480]   It struck me.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   It's out of the home.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   And to-- interesting to have to create a language for this, and is it going to be too late to enforce it?
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.480]   This is actually about bicyclists.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:20.480]   The company Argo AI, which develops self-driving systems, has released technical guidelines for safe interactions between robo cars and bikes.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:25.480]   The guidelines created in collaboration with the League of American Bicyclists.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.480]   Because humans do a really crappy job of interacting with us.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   I mean, so much so that cyclists-- I mentioned this a while ago, are putting up what they call ghost bikes where there have been car, bicycle collisions and deaths.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   We have one down the road from us here, a white painted bicycle.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:50.480]   Bicyclists are urging AV companies to incorporate the bike lanes into their AI maps.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:58.480]   And furthermore, to put models in for typical cyclist behavior, like lane splitting or swerving around an open car,
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.480]   they're prepared for such actions.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.480]   It would really be nice.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:08.480]   I actually pretty much given up bicycling around here because it's too scary, too dangerous.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.480]   I would love to be able to.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.480]   You tried the pool noodle half?
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.480]   Excuse me, even as an automobile driver, it scares me.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:19.480]   If I had a pool noodle on my head, what would I do with a pool noodle?
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   No, the pool noodle hack.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.480]   We actually see people around here riding with them.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.480]   You get a pool noodle.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   It's just strapping on the back of your bike.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   And it makes your bike--
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   Why?
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   Why?
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.480]   And people avoid it.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:35.480]   Yeah, it's mostly just to-- and it's true.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:44.480]   I see-- I am not one of those people because I ride my bike, so I know how scary it is when a car feels like it's not that far from you, but it's really freaking close.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.480]   So that's an idea.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.480]   But yeah, no, this is-- this was in it first.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.480]   I feel like--
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.480]   Around here, people would actually take aim at the pool noodle.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.480]   No.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.480]   I think it just tipped the pool noodle.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   I don't know.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.480]   If you search for--
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.480]   I'm pretty horrible.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.480]   I know.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   Pool noodle bike safety, you'll find some images of it.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.480]   Now the entire show comes to a halt.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   Well, I'm sure you good by pool noodles.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:14.480]   I won't try to contribute to the show at all.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.480]   But it's safety.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.480]   Geez.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.480]   Here it is.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.480]   God, I just get kicked.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:21.480]   I rode around San Francisco with a pool in the--
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.480]   Oh, wow.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.480]   I totally like that.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.480]   It's super visible.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   It's visible.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.480]   It's cheap.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:31.480]   This is Michelle Robertson running for the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.480]   The lead will tell you something about it.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:40.480]   If you behunch the man chats at me from the rolled down window of his silver sedan, we're
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.480]   at the intersection of Fifth Emission.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.480]   Not a fun place.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:50.480]   Yeah, angry sedan man can't get around me because I have a bright yellow pool noodle.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.480]   Five foot in length tied to the back of my bicycle.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.480]   It juts about three feet into the right lane.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.480]   Denoting the minimum safe passing distance per California law for cars and bicyclists.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.480]   Three feet.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.480]   I really like that.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.480]   I like that as a driver.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.480]   There's a certain spot.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.480]   Yeah, I like it as a driver.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.480]   I like it as a bicyclist.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.480]   Okay, you would name it me?
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480]   No, I wouldn't.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.480]   But some--
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.480]   I'm feeling San Francisco probably would.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.480]   There are people who would aim at the noodle.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.480]   Oh, no one here in this area.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   It would just say, well, let me put it this way.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.480]   Have you ever driven down a country lane with a baseball bat aiming for post office?
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480]   No, boxes.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480]   No, I--
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480]   You're a good man.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.480]   You're a good man.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   You're a good man.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.480]   Who would do such a thing?
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.480]   No one, no one in their right mind would do such a thing.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.480]   Drunk West Texans.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.480]   Okay, so anyway, I was going to say to bring it back to a tech angle.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   Just for fun.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480]   Yes.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.480]   Just going out there.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.480]   I like this story, Jeff.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.480]   I think we talked a lot about B2V standards, like vehicle to vehicle.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.480]   Vehicle to infrastructure.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.480]   It's not infrastructure.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.480]   I can't think of what.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:09.480]   And we were actually supposed to get there, but then the Trump administration ordered the--
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.480]   I can't remember if it was the national highway and--
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480]   San dieren, whatever.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480]   That one.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480]   That one.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   Yeah, it's either that one or that.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:25.000]   They basically took it out of the language that-- we didn't have to do it by any timeline.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.240]   So they took away the timeline.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.800]   So now we don't have a timeline for that.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:36.480]   And then the other thing is, this is really good information because MIT has done research
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.280]   on cars at an intersection, like self-driving cars at an intersection, and like how people
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.040]   will make-- like if I'm about to cross at a crosswalk, I try to make eye contact with
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.520]   people in the car before I step into the street.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.520]   That's a very good idea.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.640]   And there's no way to actually do that.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:54.120]   So this is talking about creating ways to have the cars communicate with people.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.600]   And I think that's really important.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.800]   So in our chat room, I think this is good.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.840]   One of our chatters has attached-- her name is Zircon.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.200]   I mounted a freight train horn on my e-bike.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200]   Nice.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   Nice.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.160]   Where can I get a freight train horn?
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.360]   Because I will do that.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.360]   That sounds like a great idea.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.280]   I'm not afraid of a freight train horn.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.720]   What is it-- let me see if I can find a freight train horn.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.720]   How do you power it?
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.880]   Do you have to have a lead acid battery to power it?
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.920]   Well, your e-bike already has a battery.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:39.360]   But you need a pretty big battery for a freight train horn.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.600]   Here's an example of what you might hear when you travel by Zircon.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.160]   A little too close.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.440]   I like that.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:56.120]   I want that on my-- I'm biking here.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.920]   I get out of my way.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.560]   Watch that fun little-- horn blasters.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.560]   I'm not doing that.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.560]   You think I'm going to get a--
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.560]   You're not going to get a special--
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.560]   A take down from the freight train--
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.560]   It costs $1,399.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.560]   Yes.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.560]   It costs $1,399.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.560]   You can buy it, really.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.560]   Huh.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.720]   Well, it's pretty heavy.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.160]   Well, I got a trike.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.840]   I can get in the fancy.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.520]   So we were talking at the beginning of the show about YouTube takedowns.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.320]   Get ready for this.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:33.160]   Over 2.2 million copyright claims hit YouTube videos between January and June of this year
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.440]   before being overturned.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.440]   Wow.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.720]   This is a report from YouTube, the copyright--
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720]   Right on YouTube.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.920]   It's a new transparency report.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.440]   Yeah, they haven't done this before.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.720]   Copyright Transparency Report.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.680]   This is good to finally shame the bozos who are doing this and put a stop to it.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:56.400]   Well, it is-- as many as that sounds, it's only 1% of the 729 million copyright claims
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.160]   issued in the first half of the year.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.320]   Yeah, so it's only the bad ones.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320]   They caught.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.320]   You know there was a heck of a--
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.040]   Well, it's this automated content ID system which catches us all the time for all sorts
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:11.040]   of things, including Canada.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.440]   When users dispute the claims, which we often do, we didn't dispute the Canada claim because
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.920]   it wasn't really fair use.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.240]   Yeah, I just didn't have enough stories, so I just played a piece.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.640]   When users disputed these claims, the case was resolved.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.080]   Although I thought it was kind of pro-Canada, right?
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.000]   And I thought it was like, Canada wouldn't mind if I used it.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.760]   It was great fodder at the time.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.000]   Yeah, well anyway, when users dispute the claims, the case is resolved in fact.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.240]   It's in favor of the uploader of the video 60% of the time.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:50.000]   So 729 million claims, 60% of them overturned.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.120]   YouTube creators have long complained.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.360]   They didn't talk to me about this, about how the platform handles claims because it always
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.840]   assumes you're in the wrong.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.840]   Yeah, it's an uploader, right?
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.840]   It's just quite a fault.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.840]   Right.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.840]   The copyright holder, whether or not the person's--
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.840]   You're guilty.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.840]   The copyright holder.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.960]   And it's problematic.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:16.520]   So the report says no system is perfect and that errors happen even with established
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:22.320]   guardrails or as you would have at fund noodles in place to prevent the abuse of enforcement
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.320]   mechanisms.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:29.600]   I think that's probably what Google's using is a couple of pool noodles to keep the guard
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:36.240]   rails when disputes take place, the process provided by YouTube provides real recourse
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.800]   and over 60% of these disputes were resolved in favor of the uploader.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:48.160]   You know, if 60% of 729 million content ID copyright claims, if 60% are wrong--
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.160]   Right, right.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.160]   That's the problem.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.160]   That's the problem.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.160]   That's the problem.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:59.120]   And the prejudice that it's going to favor-- it's going to be wrong.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.640]   It's going to be wrong in favor of the copyright-- a legit copyright holders.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.640]   Right.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:08.600]   Well, maybe the fact that they put this out here is indicative of the fact that they're
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.440]   going to start looking at how to fix it.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.440]   Yes.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   I hope so.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.440]   That's the hope anyway.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   I mean, I don't think--
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.640]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff I don't do even though I know it would be fair use just
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.480]   because we don't want to, you know, enrage YouTube.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:28.160]   And it really-- and frankly, YouTube isn't that important to our downloads or to our
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.440]   revenue.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.440]   But I want to make sure we're on YouTube for the audience to say--
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.440]   Right.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.440]   --we don't want to have strikes.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.440]   We could leave YouTube.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.440]   I don't want--
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:41.920]   Yeah, that's really-- JT says in our chat, "I'm Sony has taken me down for sharing NASA
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.920]   Apollo 8 video, which is completely public domain--
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920]   Public domain.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.840]   --because it was in Sony's libraries."
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:54.320]   And they forgot to say, "Well, we're using it, but it's not part of our content ID."
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.400]   Same thing happened with National Geographic.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.240]   We got to take down from National Geographic because we got some NASA footage in one of
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.440]   our shows.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.600]   And it was because National Geographic had the same footage.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:10.520]   And the content ID just says, "Well, yeah, they own it because they used it."
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:17.520]   Yeah, I think-- I mean, because it would be-- it would be reprehensible and truly evil
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.000]   for Google to be like, "Oh, we see that this is a real problem.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.200]   We're publishing this problem and screw everybody else out there.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.200]   We're not going to do anything about it."
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:30.160]   So I think this is probably them collecting data on the path to fix it.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.160]   This isn't that big.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.480]   I could put this on my bicycle.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.480]   170 decibels, though.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.200]   Oh, we're still building the frame.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.840]   It might be kind of loud.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.840]   It's lower.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.840]   Got the tank on the back.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.840]   You put it in the frame.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.840]   That's not bad.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:45.840]   That'll go on your trip.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.840]   170 decibels.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.640]   I'd have to wear ear plugs.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.320]   Yeah, you would.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:58.760]   It has an air valve solenoid for increased airflow to sound louder.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.200]   See what we need here?
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.040]   Stacey, we need to put that in the studio.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.000]   And when you do something bad, Stacey can help us.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.680]   Oh, that would work.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.680]   Should we get that?
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.000]   But that would work for an amp, too.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   I'm not ready to like last night on the studio.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.640]   I appreciate her being considered of me.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.640]   Thank you, man.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.040]   You've done nothing to deserve it.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.920]   Google was saying that workers would return to office January 10th.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.000]   They've backed down on that.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.960]   They sent out an email on Thursday, said, "No."
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.960]   They still encouraged--
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.520]   Do you all think this is the new normal?
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:32.880]   Yeah, I do.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.160]   And I ask this because--
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.160]   No, I do.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:35.920]   Yeah, I do.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.200]   So then what do we do going forward?
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.240]   Are we just going to adapt over the next three to five years to just--
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:45.800]   Hi, Stacey.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.440]   Are you thinking about people up in person events?
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.480]   I'm thinking about in person.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.320]   I mean, I am going to CES.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.920]   I have decided that--
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.520]   I don't want to go.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.160]   --on the cron or how--
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.520]   I am still going.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   So--
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.040]   You're going to-- yes, I just got to know you won't be here in January.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.240]   Yeah, that's what I just said.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.240]   So let me explain how this show works.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:13.280]   John writes down everything each of you says and hands me a note,
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.120]   and I read it.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.080]   And then that way, Stacey just said she won't be here.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.640]   It's in January.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.640]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.640]   I was just confused.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.160]   I was buying an air horn.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.000]   I wasn't--
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.120]   I'm like, did I not say something out loud again?
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.400]   No, I'm just confirming it.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.680]   Yes, you're not going to be here.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.840]   You're not going to buy things on the show.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:35.920]   You're going to see, yes.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.720]   So I'm not buying anything.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.560]   I'm not tweeting.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.000]   I'm the only guy here actually paying attention.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.640]   Am I going to CES?
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.320]   Any difference?
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.640]   No, you just weren't.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.000]   Although I am.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   How well is that going?
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.600]   I'm looking at the next story.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.440]   In fact, I had already started the next story.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.160]   But she was making a point.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.520]   Yeah, but she was making a point.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.680]   Ms. Stacey, you were so busy.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.520]   So that was--
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:58.520]   Yes.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.000]   So that was the story.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   Yes.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.320]   Yeah, I was just trying to--
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.320]   It is the new normal.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:03.960]   I'm going to add to the story.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.080]   I think it is the new normal.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.720]   And I think that part of it is--
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.600]   I don't know so much about going to events.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.080]   But working-- that's an industrial era notion
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.040]   that you have to come to a place of work from nine to five
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:16.880]   when it's your Friday.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.800]   A lot of industrial era bosses are going to insist on it.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.440]   But it's industrial era.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.320]   It's from when you were making widgets,
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.640]   and you had to have hands-on.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.160]   So true.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.400]   But with knowledge workers, and many, many jobs
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.680]   are knowledge-based right now.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.840]   A lot of our staff doesn't come in.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:32.840]   Yeah, it's not faculty work.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.480]   Are you OK with that?
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.720]   We're just told.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.960]   Yeah, that's our policy.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.840]   And we're doing four-day work week starting next year.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.320]   Oh.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.160]   Oh, to match the four-day school work weeks?
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.280]   Because that's a thing that's--
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.080]   That's a thing, too.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.520]   That's going to be.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.560]   Yeah, a lot of schools are having-- like teacher burnout.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.160]   So they're going to four-day work weeks.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.440]   But if you're a parent and your office has not gone
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.280]   to a four-day work week, you're kind of like--
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.320]   That's torture.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.680]   That's not why we're doing it.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.400]   But I'm actually-- I'm glad we aren't doing it.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.880]   I don't know if any schools in this area are--
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880]   Good for the teachers.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.840]   Yeah, I was going to say you should look into that,
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.480]   because that's some of the wider-reaching effects of this.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.200]   Well, Anne, I would say good for the teachers,
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.320]   except it's not good for the students.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.040]   No, it's not.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.840]   They're getting 20% less education.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.480]   I agree.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.240]   It's tough on the students, too.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:23.240]   But I have a teacher in my family,
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.160]   and some of the stuff that she's been dealing with
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.920]   from the COVID restrictions and all of that,
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.520]   in addition to the kids being pretty
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.040]   craptastic with their behavior, in addition to the parents being
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.920]   craptastic, it's really burning these teachers.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:39.640]   Oh, I know.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.880]   And it's not their fault.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.080]   But we just want to do the best for the kids.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.480]   But people have mass mandates.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.960]   Some people don't have mass mandates.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.400]   People have assignments that'll do it such and such time,
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.400]   and they throw it at the excuse.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:55.480]   Well, I can't do this assignment because I'm not well,
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   and there's nothing totally wrong.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.440]   They're using COVID as an excuse when it really isn't an excuse.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.440]   It's a mess.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.280]   People are just gaming the system all around,
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.560]   and teachers are set up.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.840]   Well, I don't blame it.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.680]   But what are we going to do about education?
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.280]   Because that's kind of important.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.120]   And my pay teacher is better.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.120]   That's the thing.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.640]   They're not making enough money to keep
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.680]   fighting this hard.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.440]   Well, that's different.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.320]   Yeah, if they're just not being paid.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:18.880]   Well, I know.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.960]   Also, they ask to do a great job.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.160]   It's hard.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:23.520]   I know.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.800]   It's really hard these days.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:29.760]   Anyway, yeah.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.160]   I think more and more we're going to be
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.560]   seeing people work remotely.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.000]   It's interesting because our sponsor for this hour--
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.280]   whoo-hoo--
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.760]   is a company called Andella.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.480]   Let's take a little break.
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.080]   We'll come back with more.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.560]   Actually, the change law is coming up.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.240]   And Bella is--
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.480]   when I talked to the folks in Andella,
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.280]   I loved what they told me.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.560]   Their motto is, "Brilliance is evenly distributed,
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.480]   but opportunity is not."
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.640]   I love that.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.760]   So brilliance is global.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.480]   There are really great engineers and programmers.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.160]   All over the world, the problem is the jobs.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.880]   Up to now, they had to live nearby.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.760]   Well, times are changing.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.240]   And more and more companies are saying,
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.120]   we can get-- we want global talent.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.280]   They're some of the best programmers in the world.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.160]   They don't have to live next door.
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.560]   And Bella can hook you up.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.360]   They're a global talent network with a mission
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.680]   to connect that brilliance with opportunity.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.880]   These days, your company is expected to move faster
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.720]   than ever before to stay ahead of the competition.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.240]   And it's hard to find time to both build and onboard
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.680]   an amazing engineering team.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.920]   You need it.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.480]   You need it.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.640]   But that's where Andella can help.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.000]   They can get you there.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.040]   They're the world's first talent network connecting
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.840]   innovative companies like yours with top tier vetted
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.960]   engineers.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.360]   So you have more time to focus on your core business.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.280]   And Bella has a very rigorous vetting process.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.320]   Their hiring process will make sure you're
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.720]   getting the best technical talent.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.920]   It's quick and efficient, but it maintains the highest quality
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.840]   admission standards.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.280]   You're going to get top quality engineers.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:04.040]   It's a truly global talent pool.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.720]   But I want to reassure you, because for instance,
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.280]   these engineers are fully embedded.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.560]   They're really part of your company.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.360]   They're embedded in your organization.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.160]   They guarantee five hours of overlapping working hours
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.520]   for the rest of the engineering team.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.920]   So it's not like they're working at night.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.960]   You're working at day.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.040]   Although sometimes the shift in hours
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.840]   is helpful to give you a broader footprint
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.360]   so you can help customers and things like that.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.320]   Andella, you could tap into their pool of highly
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.480]   top qualified talent from around the world.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.720]   Cut your hiring timeline down for months to days.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.680]   And it's very efficient to get you going.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.960]   The ramp up times are really quick,
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.360]   because Andella understands companies are expecting to do more
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:43.960]   with less.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.960]   They've got to justify ROI.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.640]   When you hire Andella engineers, you
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.360]   can expect they will be efficiently onboarded
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.920]   and work in and ready to deliver value for your team
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.680]   within days.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:56.960]   It's just great.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:57.720]   It's just great.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.640]   Mindshare, as an example-- and you'll
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.040]   find these references on the website-- Mindshare
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.560]   partnered with Andella to quickly hire 10 new digital experts.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.560]   And these are high level experts-- data scientists,
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.920]   machine learning specialists, analysts, software developers.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.720]   I have a quote from the executive director
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.200]   and head of business intelligence at Mindshare.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.640]   He says, "As we continue to enhance the Synapse platform,
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.200]   time to value is very important.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.400]   Andella is a great partner in helping us identify the right
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.160]   talent that's fit for different purposes."
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.040]   Andella, you can tap into a wider talent pool,
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.120]   stop competing with major tech companies
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.840]   for talent down the street.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.800]   There's talent all around the world.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.000]   You'll spend less time interviewing.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.200]   Brilliant is evenly distributed, but opportunity isn't.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.240]   I love that.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.080]   Visit Andella.com/4-companies to schedule a complementary
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:48.760]   consultation.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.440]   You'll get a two-week, no-risk trial
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.080]   with their vetted technical talent.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:16:00.360]   Andella.com/4-companies.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.440]   4-companies.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.560]   Thank you, Andella, for supporting this week in Google.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.600]   I think this is really great.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.560]   Bring in talent from all over the world
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.720]   into these businesses that need the talent.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.480]   And nowadays, you don't have to be sitting there.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.360]   It's not an industrial area job.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.480]   You don't have to be sitting next to each other.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.640]   You really can get the job done.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.480]   And these people are so talented.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.360]   So talented.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.920]   All right.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.120]   Let's play the drums slowly, John, because it's time for--
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.600]   The Google Change Log.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:38.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.560]   Android 12L, beta 1.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.640]   Here's everything new.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.080]   Actually, really more importantly,
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.160]   if you have a Google Pixel, the drop
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.520]   is coming out this month.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.400]   New feature drop.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.880]   But look, here's some things in the next version of Android.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.840]   12L will be released early next year.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.040]   Two more betas to come.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.520]   A little bit easier to find wallpapers.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.280]   Dark themes just for you.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.080]   Just for you.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.920]   Really easier to find wallpapers?
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.040]   They've got some real issues with Android 12.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.600]   Twicken problems in this OS, man.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:15.120]   Wow.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.840]   I'm laughing about some wallpapers.
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.200]   How about the buggy now playing notification?
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:20.720]   Really?
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.960]   Now playing is a big issue for someone.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.440]   How about I can't keep my phone calls connected?
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.000]   Really?
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   You're dropping a lot of fun.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:27.920]   How about my Bluetooth?
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.720]   That's all wacky.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.440]   Bluetooth.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.360]   Who uses Bluetooth?
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.080]   Not Kamala.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.960]   Not Kamala, but she's the part that I ask.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:35.480]   I'm good.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.640]   You're Bluetooth phobic.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.640]   That's what I say.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.120]   Well, those might be hardware issues.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.560]   No, dude.
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:47.040]   I started noticing the Bluetooth stuff on the Pixel 4
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.520]   when Android 12 came out.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.680]   It just toggles off.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.040]   You don't want a full screen widget sheet from the home screen.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.760]   And new weather grouping icons.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:57.960]   Yeah, when I have to say plus all the luck.
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:58.960]   I can't slap you.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   I'm just stating.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.960]   I'm just slapping you.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.080]   Come on, man.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.080]   Did you hear that ants going to slap you?
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:12.280]   It's going to hurt way more than the Stacey Punch Leo, but I can't wait.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.960]   Sound the air horn to the free horn.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.360]   It just annoyed me when I saw you hate your Pixel 6.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:25.640]   The hardware is great on this phone, but the OS is crap-tastic.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.320]   It is.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.080]   You don't use yours enough, I guess.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.080]   I guess not.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.080]   It's not my daily driver.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.880]   I use it, but I don't use it every...
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.880]   Well, this is something that's been driving me crazy.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:36.880]   What's that?
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:37.880]   Well, I have the always on screen.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.760]   It even shows the fingerprint, but it's not responsive.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760]   It just is.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.760]   That's a where.
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.240]   Well, what I discovered is you have to press the screen on off.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.240]   You shouldn't have to.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.240]   That's a bug, I would say.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:54.200]   If I press the button, it'll wake up and live.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.800]   This should have gone through DadGumUAT.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.800]   What's that?
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.680]   User acceptance testing before it got pushed out.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.320]   With people who have Android Auto.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.320]   Or it could have gone through A&T, because he's got opinions.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.960]   I do it on pages.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:12.960]   Well, true.
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.960]   Well played.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.880]   There is a lot of latency on this guy.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:22.360]   But no, this really bugged me.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:27.640]   All of this stuff looks like just some cosmetic, pretty ended up kind of Android stuff.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.720]   And it has nothing to do with function.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.640]   This always has to be better than what is offering up.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:39.280]   Especially when you have really nice hardware like the Pixel 6 Pro.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.880]   Let me check for an update.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.280]   Maybe I'll get an update.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.280]   Nope.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.240]   Maybe in a week or so we're going to get updates.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:51.320]   That's going to have the Pixel December security patch.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.280]   They do say nearly 100 fixes to Android 12.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.840]   So maybe some of these complaints will go away.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:05.760]   Can you control left and see if it says Bluetooth?
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.040]   Fix for distorted audio over Bluetooth in certain scenarios.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.960]   That's not the problem.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.720]   The problem is it just hurts it off.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.720]   There's quite a few fixes.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.720]   There's 100 fixes.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.320]   Fix for issue.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.200]   Which seems like a lot for--
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.200]   A lot.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.080]   It's just to unintentionally start a phone call.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.760]   That's been something people have been complaining about complaining about.
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:34.120]   Audio playback, audio noise and videos, microphone cutting out during calls in certain conditions.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.560]   That was happening to you, right?
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.480]   It cuts out or drops.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.960]   I had to call PG&E.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.800]   You know how much fun that is.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.040]   I have had calls drop on this coming from the second.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.040]   And it just stops.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.040]   So then you get back and assume--
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.040]   I just assume--
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.600]   When a call drops, I just assume it's a carrier.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.600]   Not the phone.
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.320]   That's what I was assuming at first.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.800]   But if you sit in one spot--
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:55.800]   No.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.280]   No, this is not the carrier.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.040]   General improvements for fingerprint sensor stability and performance.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.520]   They improved that last time too.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.520]   No metrics.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.440]   Camera, image quality improvements.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.960]   I expect continuous improvements in the camera.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:10.960]   Sure.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:11.960]   Camera's good.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   And I think they're just making it better and better.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.960]   Sure.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:14.960]   Oh, wait.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:15.960]   Networking telephony.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.520]   Fix for issue that disabled call features.
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:19.520]   No.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.520]   Sensors.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.880]   All right, Google, give me a call.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.880]   Let's talk.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:24.880]   Wow.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.880]   We need to talk about this.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:30.240]   All Pixel phones going all the way back to the 3A will benefit from the December update
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:33.480]   fixes that listed below.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.480]   There's quite a few--
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.480]   That's great.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.960]   So patches will go out to a lot of phones across the board, all the Pixel phones.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.480]   Well, golly.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480]   Golly.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.880]   Sorry for raising my voice earlier.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.360]   Pixel-- did you raise your voice?
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   No.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360]   Let's go over there.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:56.600]   Pixel Buds A series firmware update adding bass slider, loudness compensation, and more.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.320]   I agree with Kamala.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.200]   I don't want to use wired headphones.
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:05.120]   I really don't like Bluetooth, but that we don't have much choice.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:10.120]   The December Chromecast with Google TV update improves Dolby Vision playback storage and
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.760]   more.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:17.960]   Google Photos is-- they do this every year now starting to surface your best of 2021
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:18.960]   memories.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.280]   Let me just see.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.360]   Oh, that reminds me of another bug.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.680]   It continues to think that my photos are sideways.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.240]   And I get this little notification from the software.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.720]   It says, hey, your photos are sideways.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.680]   No, they're not.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.400]   I'm starting to hit my epics phone.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.200]   I took it that way.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.680]   Well, you mean you took it landscape mode?
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.040]   I took it in landscape mode.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.040]   Oh, no, no.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.040]   That's sideways.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.040]   That's not sideways.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:51.840]   That's not-- oh, geez.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.200]   It's a dad gum camera.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.480]   Did you have a Pixel before?
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.480]   No.
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.480]   Yes, that's all I've had.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.480]   Oh, you did.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.480]   OK.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.480]   Because I talked to you in getting the six.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.840]   No, you talked me in the get in the four.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.920]   I wanted the six.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.960]   You talked me into the four.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:07.200]   No, I told you when the six came out, I said, you can get one.
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.200]   Yes, you did.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.920]   And I was like, yeah, and I want me.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.920]   I bought it for you.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.920]   OK.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:13.920]   And I was like, yeah, I'm feeling bad now.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:14.920]   No, no.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:15.920]   The phone is fine.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:16.920]   It's the OS.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:18.920]   It's the OS.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.200]   Nice thing is the OS can always be improved.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200]   That's true.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.200]   Please Google.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.200]   Please.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.120]   How about this fix?
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.200]   And it works, Jeff, right?
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.120]   For the mysterious Android auto error.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.600]   Yeah, I was going nutso.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.880]   I bought another cable to make sure there wasn't the cable.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:36.880]   I was going nutty.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.000]   And this thing is a bit overwritten because it's all
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   very difficult.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.240]   I had to hit one button once.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.960]   Somebody discovered it because they were probably hitting
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.440]   every button in the car saying, why doesn't this work?
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.600]   You hit the talk to the car button, the little mouth.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.720]   That just opens up the communication between the car and
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.680]   the phone and like, oh, there you are.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:55.680]   OK.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:56.680]   Wow.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.680]   OK.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.680]   Here was the Android auto.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.680]   I hit it once.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.680]   Other people have done it.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:01.680]   They have to hit it every time they're doing the car or
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.680]   something, which is a bit of pain.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.880]   But I hit it once and it works.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:06.240]   One more time I kind of hit it once because I wasn't sure.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.920]   But it knocked wood.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.920]   It's working.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:09.920]   All right.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.400]   And what kind of car do you have so we can--
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.400]   Buzz.
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.400]   OK.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.240]   Because, you know, like I said, I haven't had that problem.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.440]   But I guess it just varies per automobile.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.440]   Yes, it does.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:19.440]   I have heard from people who are having issues.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.080]   I was the celebrity email of the week on all about Android.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.080]   Woo hoo.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.080]   Oh my god.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.080]   Two weeks ago.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.080]   Did you excuse them of moral panic?
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.600]   No, because they were helpful.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.760]   They couldn't have been more helpful and more nice and more
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.480]   generous and gentlemanly.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.480]   Nice work.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.480]   And informed.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480]   And informed.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.680]   And they were trying to help me out of a fix.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:42.080]   They were quite nice.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.080]   That's their job.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.080]   They do a good one.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.880]   They all got Android Tuesdays 5 PM, Pacific 8 PM Eastern on Twitch.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.360]   [HONKING]
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.880]   [HONKING]
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.240]   Are we-- is there just like a paucity of news?
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.240]   I feel like--
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.480]   There is an apostity.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:01.280]   There's a paucity of Leo.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:01.800]   OK.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:02.640]   No, no.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.560]   I'm like, OK.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.120]   We're still in the changelog.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:05.640]   changelog?
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.120]   OK.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:10.200]   And that's the Google changelog.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.200]   What?
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.200]   What work?
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:12.720]   In that--
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.880]   Now what do you want to do?
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.040]   Now, now we're moving on.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:17.560]   OK.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.320]   We could do TikTok videos.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.440]   Lots of TikTok videos.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:24.560]   The top videos of 2021.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.400]   Oh, wait.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.160]   Wait, before we do that, can we just say how excited I am
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.960]   that Jessica Rosenworsl has been--
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960]   Congratulations.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.480]   --and improved.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:32.880]   Yes.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.680]   Congratulations.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:36.840]   She is the new head chair of the FCC.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.000]   I have met her several times.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:39.920]   She's very good.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.560]   I don't want--
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:40.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:41.760]   She's so good.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.760]   She's so smart.
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.880]   She's really interested in both understanding
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.640]   how the technology works and protecting the consumer.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.280]   So she's been a commissioner for some time.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:57.040]   And as you may know, the way the FCC works
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.080]   have to be three Republicans, three Democrats,
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:02.120]   and then the chairperson.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.320]   She is the first woman--
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.360]   No, no, there are only five chairs.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:05.880]   There's five.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:06.920]   There are two Democrats.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.400]   There should be three Democrats and two Republicans.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.320]   Well, there's two chairs.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.760]   There's two Republicans-- sorry.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.360]   There's usually two Republicans, two Democrats on the chairs,
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.880]   and then whoever the president is usually
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.760]   appoints whoever is part of his party.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.960]   So the fifth person is the chairman.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.720]   OK.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:28.000]   So instead of-- OK, so I got it off by one.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.080]   So there's two of each.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.760]   Well, it was a further crucial one, yes, but it's--
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.520]   I was off by one.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.400]   It's an off by one error.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.280]   It's very common.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:39.040]   So there were two Republicans, two Democrats, and the chair.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.440]   This is the first time a woman has
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:45.400]   been a chair of the FCC in 86 years, ever.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:49.920]   Senate approval was 68 to 31, which is kind of amazing
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:54.160]   to hear that kind of majority in the Senate.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:54.800]   So--
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.680]   This GG is someone going to get through?
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:00.040]   They're fighting GG, and GG is so freaking awesome.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.760]   And I'm so mad about that.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.160]   It's such a-- is it a red herring?
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.840]   Is it whatever you put up to attack?
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.560]   It's annoying.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:13.480]   So there's empty seats at the FCC.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.160]   Yes.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.840]   And GG, would she make it complete?
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:21.400]   She would be the third Democratic commissioner, basically.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:25.000]   So they've been missing a fifth commissioner for some--
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:25.500]   Yes.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.000]   Since Trump.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.520]   And that was actually political wrangling
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.560]   by the Trump administration.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.560]   Well, the Republicans like GG.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:31.960]   First, I forget what the reason was.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.920]   It's backwards Republican logic.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.000]   And some of the Democrats-- oh, it's all complicated.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:36.960]   I haven't been able to--
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.200]   She has supported-- like she is very much
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.800]   in favor of First Amendment rights.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.320]   She's argued in favor of conservative news organizations
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:44.880]   in the past.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   But if you ever look--
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.040]   She's also a net neutrality advocate.
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:49.160]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.840]   Yeah, she's a net neutrality advocate.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.720]   She is anti-duopoly.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.200]   She is--
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.200]   It's what we need.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.160]   She's a pseudo-viral protection.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.520]   Yes, we need-- exactly.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.080]   She's brilliant.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:27:59.800]   She's informed.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.360]   She's brilliant.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:01.920]   Good.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.400]   So however, her prospects are not great.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.120]   Well, I don't know.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.320]   I don't know that they're bad.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.120]   The press in everyone is fighting for her in ways
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.080]   that are actually pretty astonishing.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.960]   Well, it's amazing that Rosenwasser--
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.280]   it's amazing that Rosenwasser got 68 to 31 vote
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.440]   in the very partisan Senate.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.520]   So obviously--
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.360]   She's charming.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:27.880]   She doesn't really know that.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.960]   There's some progress being made, which is really good.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.400]   It's important.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:36.880]   That's easy important to all of us for a variety of reasons.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.400]   OK, yes.
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.200]   Thank you for doing that and distracting us
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.840]   from TikTok's top videos of 2020.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:43.480]   We appreciate it.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:46.120]   If you go to 101, you get a long list of them.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.280]   You can pick them rather than having
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.520]   to watch their compilation.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.520]   Yeah, the CNN thing is just taking--
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:53.200]   that's just like one of those ridiculous slideshows
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.880]   where, of course, you could go to TikTok
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.720]   and see the videos, but no, CNN's
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.160]   going to give you a static slideshow.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.560]   Retention.
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.400]   I'm going to give you a chance to vote.
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.360]   We're going to watch one.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.440]   One.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:09.960]   One.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.000]   If you like TikToks, so damn much, go watch it.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.080]   Drone dancing.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.960]   Where are my squishy the chipmunk hiding nuts in his mouth,
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.920]   restocking in its finest dog painting or Zack King, who's
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.480]   kind of an amazing video effects genius,
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.400]   disappearing into his art.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.560]   Chipmunk.
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:31.760]   Chipmunk.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.200]   Squishy the chipmunk.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.600]   The account is chipmunk's of--
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.320]   Oh, dog painting.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.040]   No, dog painting is my off-seat girl.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.360]   No, I've seen the dog painting.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:40.840]   So--
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.080]   Oh, it's wonderful.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.920]   Here comes Squishy.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:44.520]   Hey, Squishy.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:50.080]   That's it, by the way.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.320]   Yeah, no, but look how cute he is.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.800]   Now he says fluffy bunny watch.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.960]   Squishy peen rent.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.160]   This is Squishy peen rent.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.440]   Because I'll ask you this is animal--
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.360]   Is he going to make it?
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.040]   Yes!
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.400]   He got them all in.
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:08.400]   OK.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.760]   All right, I'll give you your second choice.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.960]   Dog painting.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.400]   From my off-seat girl--
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.680]   Drone dancing would have been this better.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.680]   This is amazing.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.680]   This is amazing.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.200]   The dog that was doing down the snow.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:20.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:22.640]   We probably can't play this music.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.280]   So just watch the dog paint.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.320]   [SINGING]
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.240]   Dog painting blue.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.400]   Lots of blue on the canvas.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.360]   It's all blue now.
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:33.800]   That's the first one.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.840]   Now he's got some green.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.760]   That's interesting how they're cutting in between.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:39.200]   Tails me.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.720]   They really are very, very much influencing
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.400]   what the dog is doing.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.000]   Now he's doing yellow.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000]   If they weren't cutting--
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:46.920]   The dog producer.
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.360]   That's probably the dog having a producer.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.360]   They're cutting.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.000]   They're cutting.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.640]   That don't think the dog is painting a daisy.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:55.120]   I don't think the dog even knows what the hell's going on.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:57.480]   They probably put bacon on the paint.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.840]   OK.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.680]   I don't know what I'm doing here with this painting.
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.000]   I thought the trick was peanut butter.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.640]   The dog painted a daisy.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:07.400]   And there-- yeah, sure.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.840]   Quite honestly, both of those are better than what I thought
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:12.240]   would have been the best pick, the drone dancing.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.440]   Yeah, the drone dancing was not--
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:14.360]   That was horrendous.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.400]   So do not even play it.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.160]   Now you got to play it.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:17.680]   There you go.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.680]   No, no, no, we don't.
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:20.200]   No, we don't.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.240]   This horrendous.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:24.440]   I hate I gave them two seconds.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.840]   That's beauty of TikTok.
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.080]   In fact, the New York Times discovered
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:32.320]   how TikTok reads your mind.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.320]   Didn't the Wall Street Journal--
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.320]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.600]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.120]   Don't worry.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.280]   Don't worry.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.200]   It's moronic.
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.800]   I agree.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:46.120]   The CIA is big into Philip Finish the Sense.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:46.680]   Surveillance.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.400]   Bitcoin.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:48.160]   Cryptocurrency.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.360]   Taboroni.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:50.880]   Cryptocurrency.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.040]   Stacey wins cryptocurrency according to William Burns,
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:54.880]   the director.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.880]   The agency has, quote, a number of different products
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.920]   focused on cryptocurrency.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:05.920]   Projects.
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.720]   Oh, not products.
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:09.680]   Projects.
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:12.240]   This is something I inherited.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.080]   My predecessor started this, he said,
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.160]   but had set in motion a number of different projects
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:18.760]   focused on cryptocurrency and trying
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:22.360]   to look at second and third-order consequences as well
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.960]   and helping with our colleagues and other parts
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:27.200]   of the US government to provide solid intelligence
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.680]   and what we're seeing as well.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:35.120]   And actually, if you look-- this is on vice--
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.120]   at the more like-this-stories, you'll
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.520]   see why the CIA might be interested.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.880]   Man shot dead in a hail of gunfire over crypto mining rigs.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:49.000]   Ted Cruz says Bitcoin mining can fix Texas' crumbling
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:49.880]   electric grid.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.960]   Oh, God.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:54.960]   Cryptocurrency loan platform implodes in a $130 million
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.520]   track, how not to get scammed in the crypto market.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.200]   And Binance says it helped cops arrest
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:04.160]   ransomware money launderers.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.520]   So I guess you'd get an idea why the CIA might
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.160]   have some interest in all of this.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.680]   You know, probably four years ago, I was at an event
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:15.520]   and there was an FBI money laundering person there.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.360]   And they were like very excited about Bitcoin.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.560]   This was not crypto in general.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.320]   It was Bitcoin.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:24.320]   And it was because we can track things.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.440]   It's great.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:29.480]   So I get why they're excited about this.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.320]   I think you know, some of these people
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:34.560]   made the case that we wouldn't see ransomware as such a problem
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.280]   if Bitcoin did exist.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:36.320]   Bitcoin is this.
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.600]   Now that everybody knows about Bitcoin,
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:42.880]   how to get it, ransomware, despite what the CIA might say
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.360]   about tracking Bitcoin, does have some sort of an an--
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.960]   A little bit a lot better going to the 7/11
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.920]   and buying money cards.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.120]   Money cards.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:52.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:57.560]   Did you have thoughts on the blockchain story on 108
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.040]   in the security section?
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.000]   Well, let's go there and find out.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.480]   Google temporarily disrupts a botnet that
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.880]   infected 1 million PCs.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.080]   Yeah, Steve Gibson talked about this yesterday.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.760]   Gloop Teba, it's the largest botnet to date.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.400]   In case you're-- you know, what's a botnet?
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.600]   Very often, when bad guys co-opt computers,
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:26.240]   what they do is they set up a command and control IRC room.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.400]   The computer joins the room and then it waits for the command.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.360]   And there's all sorts of things you do to, you know,
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.800]   DDoS attacks try to take down gambling sites
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.840]   on Subrual Sunday, things like that.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.220]   Company--
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:40.200]   Google estimates the malware has infected approximately 1
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:42.800]   million Windows PCs globally.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.120]   They're on that botnet.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.200]   They're all infected by Gloop Teba.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.000]   Google traced it to at least two individuals based out
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.480]   of what a surprise Russia.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.840]   The company is suing them in hopes
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:59.600]   it'll set a precedent and create legal and liability risks
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.760]   for botnet operators.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:04.240]   At times, the company says it saw the network
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.360]   row by about 1,000 devices per day.
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.040]   I remember.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.400]   And this is-- I mean, this is 20 years ago at Tech TV.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:17.520]   We had gotten a tip logged into an IRC channel that
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.840]   was a botnet.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.240]   And I was watching computers join it hundreds per second.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:22.740]   Wow.
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:26.480]   The botnet was growing very fast as the malware spread.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.040]   And once the malware infected computer
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:29.720]   you computer logged in this IRC channel
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:34.160]   to wait for your command.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:37.560]   The malware that adds a computer to the Gloop Teba botnet
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.920]   is usually found hidden on sketchy websites that
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.000]   offer free software, according to Google.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.360]   The operators use the malware to steal personal data,
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.040]   mine, cryptocurrencies.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.680]   That's a big one these days.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.840]   And funnel other internet traffic
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:54.560]   through the infected machines.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.560]   Can you explain this?
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:58.280]   Unfortunately, Gloop Teba's use of blockchain technology
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.280]   as a resiliency mechanism is notable here.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.280]   And it's become a more and more common practice
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.400]   among cyber crime organizations.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.760]   The decentralized nature of blockchain
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.000]   allows the botnet, they say, to recover more quickly
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.960]   from disruptions, making them harder to shut down.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:15.600]   Maybe they're not using chat rooms anymore,
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.440]   because it's easy to go after and shut down a command
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:19.520]   control center in a chat room.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.480]   Maybe that's exactly why they're using blockchain,
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:24.560]   because it's decentralized.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:27.880]   The issue, of course, is once you get all these computers,
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.440]   you've got to somehow tell them what to do.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.600]   You've got to coordinate their activities.
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:37.960]   So anyway, Google temporarily disrupts Gloop Teba.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:40.320]   If you want more information, we did talk about it
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:43.560]   on security now yesterday with Steve Gibson.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.520]   Steve Gibson.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:49.920]   Anybody, anything you want to talk about?
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:52.120]   There's plenty of work to talk videos.
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:52.720]   No.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:54.200]   No.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:54.760]   No.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.960]   Are you glad you're not working at better.com?
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:01.640]   They fired 900 people over Zoom.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:03.080]   Well, how else are you going to--
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.000]   I saw this headline.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.760]   I was like, is it 900 people?
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:11.680]   So this one person is going to go door to door for 900 people?
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:14.720]   Well, usually you send emails.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:15.920]   I mean, there's ways to do this.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:16.880]   But then there's people to--
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:17.720]   And on the low-port.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:18.220]   Hold on.
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:22.320]   People complain about getting fired over text messages.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.880]   Well, the issue was that he--
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.200]   then the CEO got on there.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.280]   He was like, this was so hard last time.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.000]   I'm hoping I'll do better this time.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:31.560]   You know, on the list of--
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.720]   He did it again.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:33.400]   Oh, boy.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:34.280]   I come to you--
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.800]   He said with not great news, if you are on this call--
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.040]   900 people--
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.720]   you're part of the unlucky group being laid off.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:44.040]   Your employment here is terminated,
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:47.160]   effective immediately.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.400]   I don't know how--
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.120]   There's no way to get fired nicely.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:50.920]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.560]   It's not a good thing more with the other.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:54.640]   It had to be done.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:57.440]   Unfortunately, that was the more effective way,
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.480]   an efficient way to do it.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.560]   So--
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.400]   I have to--
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.400]   I have to--
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.160]   Well, we don't wear a small company.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.240]   So if people will need to be fired or laid off, I'd do it.
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.680]   Or at least it does it in person.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:12.440]   Never fun.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:16.680]   Uh, this guy did not invent Bitcoin.
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.720]   I'm just going to say this.
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.920]   No, I wanted you to explain this to me.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.320]   He wins a US court battle for Bitcoin Fortune Worth billions.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.320]   He claims he--
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.360]   A guy claims he invented Bitcoin.
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:33.960]   And he's an Australian computer scientist.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.920]   I'm not going to say his name.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.600]   He went to a-- he went to court suing the family
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:41.200]   of a deceased business partner.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:43.240]   They claimed-- the family claimed his own half
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:47.880]   of a cryptocurrency fortune worth tens of billions of dollars.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.160]   The jury did award 100 million intellectual property rights
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.920]   to a joint venture between the two men.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:58.520]   But the jury did found that this guy did not owe half
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.680]   of 1.1 million Bitcoins to the family.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:10.520]   Didn't-- he-- you know, these were some of the first Bitcoins
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.440]   to be created through mining.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.960]   They could only be owned by a person or entity involved
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:16.760]   with the digital currency from its beginning,
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.480]   such as Satoshi Nakamoto, its creator.
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:21.960]   This guy claims to be the creator.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.800]   He's not.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.840]   In order-- it's by the way, it's an easy thing.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:30.640]   If you think-- you know, if you say, I'm Satoshi Nakamoto,
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:36.760]   well, Satoshi has tens of billions of Bitcoin in his account.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.000]   All you'd have to do is move.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.160]   You wouldn't even have to do anything but just say,
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:44.360]   if you moved one zillions of a Bitcoin from that account
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:47.040]   to another account, said, look, I'm going to do that tomorrow
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.200]   and you did it, that proves it.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:49.760]   He can't do it.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.480]   So the courts and idiot--
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.000]   They don't.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.080]   The jury took the week to deliberate.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.280]   They didn't understand it.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:06.280]   Yeah, he's not a credible claimant to the role,
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:09.680]   especially because there is an easy proof, which he has never--
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.000]   he's always said, oh, yeah, I'll do that.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.480]   It never does it.
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:17.640]   So-- what does he think he's going to get?
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:18.360]   Because--
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.160]   No, to rioty.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.640]   That's why I don't want to say his name.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.140]   Exactly.
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:21.640]   I got it.
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:22.120]   Thank you.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.800]   Good call, sir.
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:25.920]   It's like that other guy who broke Mazda Crazy
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.640]   we won't mention.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:28.880]   Yes.
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:33.960]   Tech Dirt.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.920]   Podray had a good tweet.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.200]   Yeah, I wasn't going to do that.
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.800]   But now that you've called it out, I will.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.600]   You like it because it takes a pot shot
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:45.560]   at your favorite organization, or one
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:46.920]   of your favorite organizations, Newsy.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.680]   I thought Podray had a good sense of humor about it.
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:49.600]   Newsy.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.000]   Well, so it is a--
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.320]   look, it's tabloid journalism, right?
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.120]   Here, I'll find the tweet.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.400]   I can't find it in the rundown.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.400]   He said--
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:40:59.400]   It's so long.
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.640]   --the Newsy published-- I got it.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.920]   No, no, no.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.440]   Newsmax, not Newsy.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:05.560]   Your favorite Newsmax.
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:09.760]   "Bannock and Preps for Conclave" as quote, "Pope is dying."
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:11.040]   What?
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.520]   To which Father Robert says, oh, no.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:16.000]   I'll have to let him know the next time he comes over.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.360]   Rolling on the floor laughing.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.280]   I thought it was very cool that we know the guy who
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:19.840]   knows the public.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.000]   Yeah, we know the guy.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000]   That's all.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.360]   I could put in a plug for a friend of the show,
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.920]   near at Weiss Blatt, who subbed for some of the points
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:29.680]   we like her.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:30.200]   Yes.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:30.560]   Tech Glass.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.120]   She's a doctor.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.280]   She's great.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:35.160]   Her book, which we love, is Academic
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.880]   Cost $80.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.200]   But she now has an audiobook of version coming out right now.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.920]   For I think it was $13.95.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.480]   It's supposed to go up on Audible any second.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:47.080]   Good.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:51.840]   And she'll have the paperback coming out for $30 soon.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.320]   So it's an important book for those of us who cover
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.480]   technology.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.880]   And here's a plug for the brilliant Dr. Weiss Blatt.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:00.560]   She--
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.400]   I knew it.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.680]   She very kindly asked if I would read it.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.840]   And I said, I just don't have time,
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:09.800]   but I gave her some names.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:11.400]   So maybe she--
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:12.760]   I hope she found somebody--
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:13.840]   Is there a sample you could--
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.520]   could you recognize that voice in two sentences?
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.320]   I probably could.
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.440]   I sent her over to Corey Doctorow and said,
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:23.400]   Corey has his books recorded, pays for his books recorded.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:24.960]   She was very kind to ask me.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:26.240]   I was very, very flattered.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.960]   But it's hard to record a book, especially
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.440]   252 pages of--
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.320]   Yeah, this one has lots of data.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.320]   Yeah, that's--
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.000]   Let's see.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.160]   It's on--
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:36.840]   It's on that.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.640]   Quotes are very hard to read.
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:39.560]   Because you've got to know--
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.840]   --is that the different voice?
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.560]   Here's a sample.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.120]   Let's see if--
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.200]   The sentence that drew most of the reactions
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.480]   from the research interviewees was,
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.600]   but our work will never be done.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:53.120]   Perhaps since this phrase symbolizes the never ending
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:53.840]   challenge.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:54.200]   Good.
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.520]   He sounds good.
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.600]   I don't know who it is.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:01.160]   I don't recognize that voice, but it sounds very listenable.
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:03.040]   So I'll be getting that tech flash.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.640]   And tech crisis communication was on our show
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.440]   to talk about it when it came out.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:13.320]   And now it's an audio, which will make it certainly
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:16.160]   will broaden the audience.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:17.080]   Yeah, I'll check that out.
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.840]   Because it was expensive.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.640]   80 bucks.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:24.080]   Because it was academic.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.600]   Yeah, what?
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:28.520]   So explain to me is because it's such a small piece.
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.720]   No, it's what they do is they sell it--
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.960]   because libraries--
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.960]   I think it's just going to be read in the library.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.640]   There's a series of books that I love
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.360]   by a publisher called Brill.
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:41.560]   There's now 100 books about book history.
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.240]   Get me started.
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.600]   There are 140 bucks each.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.440]   Because I think nobody's going to buy this book.
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.720]   Only the library is going to buy it.
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.200]   So we're going to charge a very high price for it.
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.280]   I'm trying to get Gutenberg the Geek out.
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.280]   And it'll probably be with an academic publisher,
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.680]   not going, what if I get one?
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:58.920]   I'm talking to one now.
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.600]   And I just don't want it to be an $80 book.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.600]   I'm just going to say something.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.800]   Peter Boris reads it.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.760]   Peter J. Boris.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.360]   And you look forward to--
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.520]   you can go to near its website.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.040]   Probably is the best place to go.
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.720]   Yeah, that's where you go.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.080]   Congratulations.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:16.600]   Google her.
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:18.360]   Oh, there's another one that's interesting.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:22.320]   So there was a recent academic paper,
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.280]   like today, that looked at the search engines--
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:30.080]   this is line 56 and 57.
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:35.360]   Search engines and how much they promoted conspiracies.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.600]   And they put in, I think, six basic conspiracies, QAnon.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:43.760]   I forget what the others were.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:50.160]   And they looked at Google, Yahoo, Bing, Zandex.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.080]   And I'm forgetting one.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:52.560]   And Dr. Go.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.960]   Dr. Go, yeah.
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.680]   And the only one that was free of conspiracies was Google.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:44:59.680]   Zegogon.
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:00.680]   Where the others--
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.680]   Interesting.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:02.680]   Yeah, it was interesting because Google obviously
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.400]   goes to the effort to clean them out.
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:07.320]   And so if you go to the explanatory Twitter thread,
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:11.360]   they have some graphics there that show what they did here.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.280]   So I think that was interesting to see
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:17.680]   that if you go to the effort, you can have an impact.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.640]   And they chose to do this, and they did it.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.640]   So--
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.440]   It's a preprint.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:26.120]   It's a preprint.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:26.800]   Yes, that is.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.480]   Which means it's not--
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.480]   It's not been peer reviewed.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.480]   Peer reviewed.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.360]   Neither have we been.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.040]   We are not peer reviewed.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:33.560]   Let's see.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:36.120]   Cussing all the chat room peer reviewed.
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.120]   I like the chat reviews.
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:38.840]   It's kind of reviewing us in real time.
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.760]   Yeah, yeah, straight.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:46.080]   Do they-- does she say--
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:51.560]   she's a postdoctoral researcher at social computing group.
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.480]   Yeah, it looks like she's got a Swiss URL.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.480]   So--
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:55.980]   Yeah.
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:57.080]   So we'll see if something--
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:01.640]   It funds that is the question I would be curious about.
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.880]   The Department of Informatics at University of Zurich.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:05.240]   OK, that's fair.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:07.160]   That's safe.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.720]   The Leibnitz Institute for Sociolvison-Shoften in Germany.
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:12.080]   That sounds good.
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:12.600]   Yeah, I see.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:13.360]   All right.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.600]   All right.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.760]   But you know, that's appropriate.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.320]   You should ask when you read a study, especially
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.640]   if it's not peer reviewed.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:21.280]   You know, what was the funding?
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.600]   Just nothing here really is--
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:29.680]   Sparking Joy.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:30.480]   Sparking Joy.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:34.400]   The Rohingas are search-suing Facebook
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.160]   for a mind-boggling 150--
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.360]   now this says million, but I heard it saw billion.
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:42.200]   So maybe I misread it.
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:42.960]   I put this in here.
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:43.560]   I thought it was--
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.840]   What do you do with genocide of people?
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:48.240]   Yeah, well, what's that worth, right?
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:49.880]   Axios is saying million now.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.400]   So maybe I misread it.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:52.600]   Somebody did a typo.
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.320]   Million seems more reasonable.
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:58.000]   150 billion sounds like you don't expect anybody to take it
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.840]   seriously, but we're just going to ask for a giant amount
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:01.040]   of money.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:04.640]   Nonetheless, I think this is with a lot of merit.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:05.240]   There's no question--
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:06.080]   Where are they suing?
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:06.920]   In what court do they sue?
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:07.920]   US?
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:09.520]   In the US courts.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:11.680]   Who is suing?
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.320]   I mean, you can't sue--
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.920]   the Rohingya people can't sue.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:18.000]   The Rohingya refugees from the US
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.920]   are suing in San Francisco seeking the court--
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:27.320]   Caught to us.
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:31.000]   --to apply Burmese law.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.840]   So this is kind of complicated.
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:34.840]   That is.
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.360]   The back story, in case you didn't know,
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:41.280]   is that thousands of Rohingya Muslims were killed in Myanmar.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.880]   The UN called it genocide.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:50.360]   And Facebook is widely accused of allowing anti- Rohingya--
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.160]   We were talking actually about this, I think, on Twitter--
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.640]   maybe you were saying this, Jeff.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:58.800]   One of the problems is you can--
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:02.320]   content moderation in English, in big languages,
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.800]   can be well done by these companies.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:07.320]   But it's these narrow languages where they don't have
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.840]   a lot of content moderators very hard.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.360]   And they're in the cultural context.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:13.640]   And you don't have the context.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:16.920]   You have to pet people on the ground and so forth.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.000]   The UN report in 2018 said Facebook played, quote,
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.160]   "a determining role in disseminating hateful rhetoric
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.600]   in Myanmar."
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.920]   The International Criminal Court has
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:30.200]   opened an investigation into crimes against the Rohingya
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:32.080]   Muslims in Bangladesh and Myanmar.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:38.880]   So Facebook issued a statement back in 2018.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:46.760]   I think that this will be an interesting.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:50.000]   Legal experts note there's no known successful legal precedent
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.520]   for invoking foreign law in a suit
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.800]   against social media firms, especially
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:57.000]   because of Section 230.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.680]   So that's why they want Burmese law.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:00.920]   They're protected under 230.
[01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:03.280]   They're not liable in the US.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:04.920]   But they are liable under Burmese law.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:06.680]   But they're assuming in the US.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:08.560]   So it's complicated.
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:12.640]   And if all of this goes through that nation that's
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.520]   suing Facebook, what can Facebook do to stop this from happening
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:18.840]   again?
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:19.520]   Well, it's hard.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.280]   And that's what we're talking about.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.000]   But they didn't--
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.160]   I mean, Facebook has--
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.880]   I mean, this is one of my chief criticisms
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.080]   against Facebook is this seems to happen again and again
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:31.200]   in the Philippines.
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:34.000]   Yeah, they know they're evil and they just don't care.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.120]   Well, they don't care.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.160]   They have not found a way to do something about it.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:42.200]   Is it just going to take more and more nations suing
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.800]   Facebook before something even gets threatened?
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:44.840]   Well, this isn't a nation.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:45.920]   These are refugees.
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:47.640]   But people suing, yeah.
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.240]   I don't know.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.640]   I don't think Facebook's at all threatened by this lawsuit.
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:52.520]   That's the real truth of it.
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.200]   They have enough lawyers.
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.720]   I just don't think it's going to go forward.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:01.200]   I'm kind of on the Rohingya side, you know?
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.760]   But I don't know if they're--
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.960]   and I think they have merit, but I
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:06.400]   don't think they have standing.
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.480]   But the other point of doing this is for the attention.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.000]   Yes.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.360]   And that's why we're giving it.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:18.920]   Amazon launches Alexa together.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:21.840]   I think we're going to have to get our IoT person to say,
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:22.720]   what the hell is that?
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:27.560]   A new service to help you care for the ones you love.
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:30.920]   Alexa together, you know, I guess they were talking about this.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:32.360]   I remember in an event.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:32.960]   This would be--
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:33.320]   Yeah, I would say--
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:34.520]   --and accept for my mom.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:34.880]   --for my mom.
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:44.440]   $19.99 a month, $20 a month, or $199 a year.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:50.240]   And then it's a way for you to support loved ones,
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:53.040]   keeping you together even when you're apart.
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:57.800]   You get customized alerts, 24/7 urgent response.
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.520]   You can see how things are with snapshots
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:03.640]   of your loved ones, echo and smart home interactions.
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:06.200]   Additional family members can join you to support your loved
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:06.700]   ones.
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.400]   But I think this is probably a good thing.
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:08.400]   That's very--
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:09.000]   --remotuses--
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.200]   Agasta!
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:11.200]   Agasta!
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.200]   Agasta!
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.640]   Set reminders on a loved ones echo, managed shopping lists,
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:17.800]   linked music services, and more.
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:20.600]   When I brought my mom an echo and set it up for her,
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:22.320]   it was set up on my account.
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.240]   And it didn't take her very long to reset it,
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:26.800]   because she said, I see your calendar notifications.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.400]   I don't-- I want mine.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.960]   But of course, she didn't know how to make it hers.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.120]   And so it just doesn't work.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:37.360]   And there's also, if a compatible device detects a fall,
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:41.720]   Alexa calls urgent response and notifies emergency contacts.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.600]   Or they can shout, call for help.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.520]   So I think this is pretty cool.
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:46.640]   I think this is a good idea.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:50.440]   It is expensive, but I guess 200 bucks a year is not.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.680]   We just moved my father--
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:52.680]   --compensiveness.
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:54.120]   --my 95-year-old father.
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:57.320]   And he's now seven miles away, which is a blessing.
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:58.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:51:59.520]   But I was so--
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:00.560]   --totally convinced me to do that.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:01.360]   I was so worried.
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:03.640]   And I was looking at this and thinking, how do we do it?
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:06.640]   But the problem is he's not even fine.
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:08.160]   There's no device he can use.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.280]   No, no.
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:13.520]   But some of this is you using it to keep an eye on him.
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:16.280]   And one of the things you're paying for with a 200 bucks
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:21.760]   a year is a 24/7 urgent response team.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:26.080]   He could have reached it by saying, echo call for help.
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:28.560]   The fall detection-- you know, I have my mom's fall detection
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:29.040]   on her watch.
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:30.680]   I don't know if it works with this.
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:32.960]   But if it detects a fall, then the echo would say,
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.880]   do you want me to call urgent response?
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:36.560]   Do you want me to connect you to urgent response?
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:37.040]   OK.
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.000]   All right.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.680]   Remote assist, if the loved one chooses to activate it,
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:42.560]   that's worth $200 a year, man.
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:44.160]   I think so.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.520]   Given a homemade would cost that much a day.
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.800]   So I think that's good.
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:51.680]   I'm counting down until we see the story about violating
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:54.320]   the privacy of our elders.
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:54.680]   Well, notice--
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:56.440]   Why don't I post did it?
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:57.120]   Already?
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.000]   They did in November.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.080]   But OK, hold on.
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:02.280]   Because you did actually, at the very beginning,
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:03.880]   call for my thoughts on this.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:05.240]   And then you just kept going.
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:07.120]   No, no, I wanted to tell everybody, well, I'm
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:07.920]   set in the stage.
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.120]   You were still in the background.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:11.000]   This is everything you need to know.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.040]   So now what does Stacy think is the question.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.160]   Now, Jeff had a dumb question.
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.040]   And then now we're at the meat of it.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.200]   Now we're at the heart of it.
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:18.560]   Now we're at the value.
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.600]   Now we're the reason people are here.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.200]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:25.600]   Bless his heart.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:26.600]   So--
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:29.320]   Just a couple of things.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:29.960]   Quick, quick.
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:32.120]   Not even corrections, just little addendums.
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:35.080]   So the device that you would buy to detect
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.520]   falls, that's an additional device.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:39.960]   It's got to be set up in each individual room.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.120]   It's $250 for that device.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:42.640]   Whoa.
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:43.480]   And it uses radar.
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:44.880]   It's very effective.
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:47.960]   I've talked to the company that makes it a bunch.
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:50.640]   So that's a very interesting device.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:52.480]   If you're going to buy something like that,
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:55.680]   it's nice because it monitors for the things most people
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:58.120]   are worried about without using a camera,
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:00.000]   because it's just using radar.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.960]   So one of the nicer things about this particular setup
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:09.040]   is that you will see that your parent interacted
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:12.200]   with Madam A or a look, but you don't know what they did.
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:15.000]   So you'll see your mom played a song.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.400]   Your mom asked the time, but you don't know exactly
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:19.080]   what they're doing.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:20.560]   Or your mom turned on a light, but you
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:23.000]   don't know if it's in the bathroom or what.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.480]   The other thing that's nice is this
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:28.920]   is an evolution of their care hub stuff, which they launched
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.240]   the year before.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:32.800]   Now you can do one to many.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:37.480]   So it doesn't have to be just you, Leo, controlling
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:38.560]   your parents account.
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:39.880]   Yeah, my sister could do it.
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:40.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:43.240]   And she's down the road.
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:45.080]   So that would actually work out really well.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:46.400]   I suspect we'll be doing this.
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.000]   Mom's 88.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.080]   She doesn't have-- she's living at home by herself.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.320]   She doesn't have in home care.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:54.480]   But I think this would be--
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.840]   eventually she'll need that, obviously.
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:57.800]   But this is a step in between.
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:58.560]   This looks really--
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:01.800]   Yeah, no, this is a really compelling service, I think.
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:04.440]   And it's fairly privacy-preserving.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:07.480]   I mean, what is elder?
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:10.880]   I mean, basically, to stay in your home,
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.680]   you might have to give up some of your privacy.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:14.000]   It's really terrible.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.240]   And if you don't want to do this, you don't have to do it.
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.080]   Obviously--
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.080]   Oh, yes.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:22.920]   So nobody's making anybody to it, I hope.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:26.040]   Well, no, I mean, I can see someone saying, hey, look, Mom,
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:27.920]   if you don't want to go into assisted living,
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.960]   you're going to have to do this.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.120]   Right.
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:33.280]   Right.
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:35.440]   Usually, that's if you don't want to go into the living,
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.440]   then we're bringing in some stranger
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:38.240]   and you're home every day.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:39.480]   And I know I'm not going to do that.
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:40.840]   And that's the fight that I've heard.
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:43.200]   It's a tough one all around, it really is.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:46.880]   After my father had breakthrough,
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:50.520]   then he was in the hospital, then he was in rehab,
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:51.960]   it hits you for a loop.
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.680]   And he says, I need this kind of help.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:56.760]   And we said, oh, yes, OK, great.
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.120]   And the opening was there.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:03.120]   And it's never an easy discussion,
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:05.880]   but I hope somebody takes care of all of us
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:06.720]   when we get that old.
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.160]   I did give my mom an Apple watch for the fall detection
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.240]   and some of that stuff.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:15.000]   She loves it and it keeps her--
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.040]   it encourages to be active and stuff like that.
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:18.640]   So there's intermediate steps.
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:22.440]   Technologies, I think, as because Jeff baby boomers,
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:25.560]   we're getting older and there's going to be a very big market
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:27.320]   for this kind of stuff for us.
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:28.840]   And I think there's going to be a lot of services
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.560]   to keep you in your home.
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:31.960]   Yes, which I think is good.
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:32.480]   I see.
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:34.960]   That's definitely evident.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:37.680]   And this is nice because a lot of people--
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:40.120]   there's no indication that you're old, right?
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:42.160]   So if you look at-- a lot of people
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:45.360]   don't want to wear the bracelets or the buttons
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:47.520]   because it's an indicator, even hearing aids,
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:48.840]   that they're old.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:52.160]   And this is pretty normal.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:53.640]   It's kind of hidden throughout your home.
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.680]   So--
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:56.080]   Good.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.160]   Thank you, Amazon.
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:56:58.480]   On the other hand, there's a lot of people
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.800]   who are in the Washington Post name post.
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:01.680]   It's got a little-- can't wait to change their name.
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:07.760]   What if there's got to be a name in journalism
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:09.680]   for this kind of story?
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:10.520]   It was done before.
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:12.080]   We've talked about it before, but I put it--
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.400]   back in there just because it keeps coming round again.
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:18.440]   Billy Joel and Christy Brinkley named their daughter
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.560]   in 1985.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.120]   In 2015, 6,000 baby girls were named.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:28.640]   There's actually a good story in Bradstone's Amazon
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.920]   Unbound about how they came up with that name
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:33.080]   and all the other names they considered.
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:36.400]   It wasn't by any means a slam dunk.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.760]   In fact, it was kind of a late decision.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:39.800]   Do we call it?
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:40.800]   Call it?
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:41.400]   Call it?
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:42.520]   Huh?
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:43.960]   This is show of graph.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:45.920]   Show the graph.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:48.880]   Suddenly, the names--
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:49.800]   When the--
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:54.560]   So this peak right here is released nationwide.
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.480]   This sudden plummet is the drop in people named--
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:02.080]   babies named the-- given the name--
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.800]   you wouldn't name your kid.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:06.240]   After Billy Joel named their kid,
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:08.760]   the numbers went up and up and up.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:10.320]   He wrote a song, didn't he?
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:13.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:14.800]   As one does.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:15.640]   As Billy Joel does.
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:17.120]   As one does, as he does.
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:19.800]   In 2020, only about 1,300 babies were given the name.
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:24.800]   OK.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:27.480]   I mean, there's a name for this kind of story.
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:30.720]   It's kind of a lifestyle, soft--
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:31.800]   Moral panic.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:32.600]   Moral panic.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:33.560]   I don't think that's the name.
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:34.560]   I don't think it's the name.
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.160]   No, it's a lot of talking.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.120]   Name that I'm looking for.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:39.120]   Do you want to talk about--
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:40.480]   Is your basic effort for a trend story?
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:41.480]   I know your--
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:42.200]   A trend story.
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:43.520]   That's the word I was looking for.
[01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:44.720]   Trend story.
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:47.040]   Do you want to talk about Benedict Devon's slides?
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:48.400]   You do every year we--
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:50.720]   Oh, that time of year.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:52.440]   Yeah, it is a time of year.
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:55.600]   I think Ben's brilliant and a great analyst.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.360]   And I don't know how many pages it is.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:01.960]   What was it?
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:02.880]   Oh, hell, I should look--
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:04.600]   I'm sorry, I should look up the--
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:08.240]   The name of it is Three Steps to the Future,
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:16.960]   which is essentially the premise is Three Trends in 2021.
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:22.720]   You know, it's funny because Amy Webb, who is a regular on our Twitch show, would love her.
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:23.640]   She's a futurist.
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:28.200]   Aw, a future today Institute, came to us a couple of weeks ago and said,
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:32.520]   I'd like to do a show about the future on Twitch.
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:37.560]   So we contacted, I think, Daniel Suarez, science fiction author.
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:41.720]   And I thought we're going to get a scientist as well and get Amy
[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.960]   and talk about future trends.
[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:45.240]   That'll be early next year.
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:47.040]   I think it'll be the first--
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:50.080]   like January 7th, the first week of the first Twitter--
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:50.640]   Nice.
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:51.800]   I'll watch that.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:53.080]   Won't that be interesting?
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:55.040]   But let's see what Ben has to say.
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:57.000]   OK, future.
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.400]   Here's a whole slide.
[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:02.000]   This one-- can you summarize this, Jeff?
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.240]   It says future.
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:04.040]   There you go.
[02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:05.080]   I'm trying to look for the slides.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:05.720]   There you go.
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:07.160]   OK.
[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:08.840]   The tech vision's for 2030.
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:10.320]   It's the numbers up.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.520]   He's got two dots.
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:14.920]   One says web 3, one says metaverse.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:19.920]   And then he's got a lot of other words, random words put together.
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:23.360]   And then the great rebranding.
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:26.200]   Where you define the vision instead of broader goal for VR and crypto.
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:29.720]   So cryptocurrencies are now going to be called web 3.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:31.560]   Yeah, so which is basically saying it's BS.
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:32.200]   Yeah.
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:35.880]   VR, AR, going to be called metaverse, the next plat.
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:36.920]   Well, that was interesting.
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:39.680]   He says the next platform after smartphones.
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:42.400]   I think that's probably true.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:48.920]   Web 3, the holy Roman Empire is neither holy nor Roman nor an empire,
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:50.320]   according to Voltaire.
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:55.560]   Cryptocurrency is neither secret nor only a currency.
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.560]   Blockchain or DLT are not databases.
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:02.600]   That's what Voltaire would have said, had even born later.
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:09.160]   Blockchain is a distributed open computing system, or at least that's the plan.
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:11.680]   Web 3, the dream of the next version of the internet.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:14.080]   Users read the web, publishers create and make money.
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:17.400]   Web 2.0 users create networks control and make money.
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:22.120]   Web 3 users create, users control networks and money.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.360]   And you know what, I'm done with this.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.400]   This is fun.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:26.280]   This isn't that insightful.
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.080]   OK.
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:33.000]   Buzzfeed went public.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.920]   Is that interesting, Jeff?
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:37.520]   It is, for lots of reasons, because it's journalism.
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:39.680]   It's a SPAC.
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:43.920]   But a whole bunch of the SPAC holders backed out before--
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:45.120]   Who?
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:46.800]   It was a SPAC-BAC.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.120]   It was a SPAC-BAC, yes.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:51.080]   And so they didn't get as much money as they wanted me.
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:55.360]   Well, NBC was not happy about the valuation, which was a clawback on a SPAC-BAC.
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:56.160]   And so--
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:58.000]   NBC owns Buzzfeed.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.480]   And then NBC invested hugely.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:01.480]   Podcast.
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:02.200]   Missed hugely.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:04.640]   That was a sitcom cast, my friends.
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:10.440]   They own Buzzfeed News, HuffPost, Taste, acquired complex media.
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.440]   Complex is part of this.
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:12.600]   It's part of what Joe does.
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:15.360]   I thought Verizon owned HuffPost.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:17.480]   They sold it to Buzzfeed.
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:18.240]   Oh.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:19.480]   Verizon got out of all that media stuff.
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:22.600]   And they bought complex from Hurston Verizon for $300 million.
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:24.040]   It's part of the steal.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:27.440]   And then, Joe DeBredi thinks the only way to compete with the big guys
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.320]   is to become a big guy.
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:29.840]   He's the fatter in CEO.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:30.400]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:31.080]   He's brilliant.
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:35.360]   I mean, Jota was the brains behind HuffPost, too, really,
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.960]   and all their technology.
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:41.880]   But the SPAC didn't work so well.
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:45.240]   The 94% of investors withdrew.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:45.760]   Yes.
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.640]   I don't understand SPACs well enough to understand fully what that means.
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:51.400]   But that means there wasn't as much money in this for--
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:55.240]   Yeah, you raise a bunch of money, and then you take things public through a pipe, basically.
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:58.280]   So you usually merge with a public company.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:58.960]   But you have--
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:01.520]   You raise all the funds with the idea of doing this.
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:03.920]   So they just didn't have enough money to do their deal.
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:06.080]   Or did they buy a cheaper company?
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:08.440]   The merger raised roughly $16 million
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:12.880]   after investors withdrew about 94% of the $287 and 1/2 million,
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:15.760]   previously raised by the SPAC.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:18.000]   The company also raised an additional $150 million
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.760]   in convertible note financing borrowing as part of the SPAC deal.
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:26.040]   Well, it came out at $10 today, it closed at $768.
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:28.600]   The--
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:29.600]   Yes.
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:30.120]   Yes.
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:32.040]   Nobody's investing in media.
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:34.120]   Down 22%.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:38.000]   And finally-- because we're going to take a break and then get your picks of the week.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.720]   Finally, the Chinese have finally made contact with an alien civilization
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:46.000]   on the backside of the moon.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:46.600]   There it is.
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:49.200]   They call it mystery hut.
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:51.520]   The outhouse of the moon.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:55.760]   Their rover is only-- it's only turn 60 feet away.
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:56.800]   It's like the monster--
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:57.640]   It's like the monster.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:58.200]   It's like the monster.
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:03:59.720]   Three months to get over there.
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:00.320]   Yeah.
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:02.120]   It's not moving fast.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:09.280]   It looks like it's cubic, which means that either there are aliens on--
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:10.480]   there are wombats.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:11.640]   Stone inch.
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:13.320]   Because it's a cube.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:13.840]   And--
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:15.280]   Oh, my wombat poop.
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:18.840]   It could be-- that's John's joke.
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:21.000]   It could be a monolith.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:21.280]   Except--
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:22.280]   It was a 1.
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:24.520]   It would be the monolith from Spinal Tap.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:25.600]   It would be kind of like a little one.
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:28.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:31.560]   Actually, it's hard to say how big it is.
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:35.200]   I think it might be actually like five meters tall, but I'm not sure.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:37.360]   Thought the initial report said 20 meters tall.
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:37.880]   20 meters.
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:38.380]   OK.
[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:38.720]   All right.
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:39.920]   OK.
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:42.240]   Anyway, it looks kind of like a cube.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:45.840]   So in three months, two to three months, the--
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:46.320]   You two--
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:47.160]   You will have forgotten about it.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:51.880]   Two will spend-- well, if you put it in lunar terms,
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:53.720]   it's only two to three lunar days.
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:54.640]   So it's not--
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.240]   Oh, OK.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:55.680]   --long.
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:56.880]   I'll still forget about it.
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:58.920]   They have to-- because they have to avoid craters.
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:00.440]   Because if they fall in, it's like there's
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:02.120]   nobody to get them out.
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:04.400]   And be like the Estonian rat robots, yeah.
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:06.360]   Yeah.
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:09.160]   So that's a good-- you know, that's a good story.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:12.520]   Wouldn't it be amazing if they got there and it is a cube?
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:13.720]   It's like, wow.
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:14.520]   That would be amazing.
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:15.160]   You went on.
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:15.160]   Yeah.
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:16.160]   It's a cube.
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:17.160]   It's a cube.
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.160]   Want to get it?
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:19.160]   Oh, nice.
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:22.240]   Nice.
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:24.480]   Let's take a break and--
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:25.800]   I love the Peter Gallery.
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:27.240]   Peter Gallery gives me such joy.
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:27.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:29.080]   The jamboree is hilarious.
[02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:30.080]   Yeah.
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:32.600]   Thank God for jammer bee.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:35.400]   We will have final thoughts and picks
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:39.640]   after a word from our sponsor, Moissa.
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:41.440]   You know, the post office process
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:47.000]   is 36 million address changes in 2020.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:52.520]   A huge chunk of your customer data is out of date.
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:54.400]   An estimate is about 30% of customer data
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:56.000]   goes bad every year.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.480]   That's why you need Melissa.
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:58.920]   Melissa.com/twit.
[02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:02.240]   They're the address experts.
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:06.120]   In fact, over the last 35 years, 10,000 businesses
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:10.720]   have used Melissa to dedupe customer information,
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.600]   to add to customer information, to correct customer information.
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.520]   You can verify addresses, emails, phone numbers,
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:23.080]   and names with Melissa for over 240 countries and territories.
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:26.280]   In fact, you can even do it at the point of entry in real time,
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:28.120]   because Melissa has a great API.
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:30.840]   You could try the API with their new lookup apps.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:35.000]   Just came out for iOS and Android.
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.720]   You can also dedupe.
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:37.520]   I mentioned this.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:40.120]   Their data matching will eliminate clutter and duplicates,
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:42.040]   which means your database is more accurate.
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:45.000]   It also means you're not sending in three catalogs
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.480]   and annoying people to the same address.
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:50.280]   So that saves you on postage and mailing costs.
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:52.400]   It'll help with identity verification.
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:54.880]   You'll reduce risk, ensure compliance,
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:57.560]   and of course, keep customers happy.
[02:06:57.560 --> 02:07:00.600]   I know this because we were selling Twit--
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:03.160]   remember we selling those Twit masks for COVID?
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:04.360]   And they all went to one guy in Florida.
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:05.400]   One guy in Florida.
[02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:08.160]   Yes, Melissa would have fixed that, man.
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:10.080]   There are you can convert addresses
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:11.680]   into latitude and longitude.
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:14.520]   That's helpful for delivery and things like that, geocoding.
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:17.920]   You can remove up to 95% of bad email addresses
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:21.400]   from your database with the Melissa's email verification.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:24.040]   And the beauty of Melissa is you can deploy it
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:25.720]   in whatever way you want--
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:28.640]   deployment platforms and options to suit any preference,
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.080]   business size or budget.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:32.160]   On-prem, you could do a web service.
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:34.680]   You can even upload to their secure FTP server,
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.840]   then download the cleaned up file.
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:39.800]   You can use their software as a service.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:42.320]   Of course, the API really is what a lot of people
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:45.840]   use building Melissa into their customer service software
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:47.320]   or their shopping carts.
[02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:49.440]   You probably even used Melissa if you've ever noticed.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:51.320]   You enter an address and it says, you mean this?
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:52.880]   Yeah, Melissa.
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:56.320]   Melissa, by the way, treats your data like the gold
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:59.280]   that it is they constantly undergo independent security
[02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:02.080]   audits to reinforce their commitment to data security,
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:03.920]   privacy and compliance requirements.
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:08.240]   They're SOC2 compliant, HIPAA compliant, GDPR compliant.
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:13.000]   Melissa's Global Support Center offers 24/7 world-renowned
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.760]   support if you sign up for service level agreements.
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:17.000]   You can acquire about that today.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.600]   They're still supporting communities
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:22.920]   and qualifying essential workers during COVID-19.
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:25.120]   You may even qualify for six months of free service.
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:27.320]   Just apply online at Melissa.com.
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:31.880]   Name to Gartner's magic quadrant for data quality solutions.
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.080]   That's the second year in a row.
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.960]   Nice going, Melissa.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:38.640]   Make sure your customer contact data is up to date.
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:41.120]   Try Melissa's APIs in the developer portal.
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:44.120]   It's easy to log on, sign up, and start
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:47.440]   playing in the API sandbox 24/7.
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:49.360]   Get started today with 1,000 records
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:59.360]   cleaned for free, Melissa.com/twit-melissa.com/twit.
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:02.400]   Thank you, Melissa, for supporting this week in Google.
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:04.760]   Thank you for supporting us by using that address
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:06.560]   so I know you saw it here.
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:11.960]   Melissa.com/twit-stacy, do you have a pick of the week?
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:12.960]   I do.
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:17.640]   This is part of the Stacey Love Sharing Books with People.
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:20.360]   Oh, this is a good time for Ant to tell you about our book
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:22.760]   club date if we found it.
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:24.080]   Yeah, about that.
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:26.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:27.080]   Wow.
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:28.880]   So I'm not going to tell you about that yet.
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:29.880]   Wow.
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:32.440]   But the book I want to tell you about today
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:35.160]   is called AI 2041.
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:36.720]   And I think a lot of y'all are going
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:39.560]   to be really interested in this because it
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:41.760]   is a collaboration between--
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:42.920]   oh, I'm going to butcher this.
[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:43.640]   And I'm so sorry.
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:46.640]   Chen Kifan, maybe Kifan?
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:48.240]   And Kai Fu Lee.
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:52.840]   Kai Fu is a researcher at Microsoft.
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:54.960]   And he's worked at Microsoft, Google.
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:57.800]   I don't actually know if he's still at Microsoft.
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:03.080]   And Chen Kifan is an author.
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.960]   So what they've done is they've created a book that
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:11.000]   is a number of 10 short stories and then an essay afterwards
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.800]   by Kai Fu Lee about the--
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:14.680]   it is all about AI.
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:16.680]   So 10 stories about AI.
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:20.880]   And then he explains why this will happen
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:23.920]   and how it could kind of vary a little bit in the next 20
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:25.440]   years.
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:29.560]   And so it really taps into, I like reading science fiction.
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:33.040]   And also, I really like understanding
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:34.920]   the technology behind it.
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:35.560]   And this is like--
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:40.600]   I think we should get them on our prediction round table.
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:42.560]   Sounds like, huh?
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:43.640]   Kai Fu Lee.
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:44.640]   Chen Kifan.
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:45.640]   Chen Kifan.
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:46.640]   Chen Kifan.
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:47.640]   Chen Kifan.
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:50.120]   Chen Kifan.
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:52.400]   So I'm going to be honest.
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:57.000]   The first two stories feel very not good as stories.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.200]   They're just like--
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:00.160]   they're more like thought exercises.
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:02.640]   They're not complete plot driven kind of stories.
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:05.160]   But if you go past those, they get better.
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:08.440]   So the stories sometimes feel like they're very much
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.160]   harnessed in service of explaining specific AI.
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:13.280]   But he explains GANs.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:15.560]   He explains transducer formation.
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:18.240]   I mean, this is hardcore.
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:21.160]   And if you don't like that, you can just skip all in.
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:22.240]   And just read the stories.
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:30.080]   40 AI 2041, 10 Visions for a Future, brand new.
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:32.400]   Wow, that sounds really interesting.
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:33.920]   It's like--
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:36.680]   you probably have to be a certain type of person to like it.
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:40.040]   But I feel like our audience has some of those types of--
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:41.600]   I think this is going to be better than the one
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:42.840]   written by Henry Kissinger.
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:44.360]   I'm just saying.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:44.800]   Oh, yeah.
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:45.800]   Yeah, 100%.
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:47.560]   Yeah.
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:50.440]   And Kai Fu Lee doesn't sound like--
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:53.600]   is when he's reading it.
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:54.560]   Cool.
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:54.880]   Cool.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:56.640]   I'm going to have to put this on my audible.
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:57.840]   It is available on "Ununable."
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:11:59.640]   So that's great.
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:00.240]   Nice.
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:01.760]   Yeah.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:02.760]   And--
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:04.960]   Or amps like, oh no.
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:08.840]   What if Stacy makes me read this book one day?
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:09.240]   Yeah.
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:11.320]   Oh, what is the deal with the book group?
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:16.840]   Well, the thing is, I suggested a date before the show actually.
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:20.400]   And then I realized, dang, is that too soon?
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:22.000]   Oh, we have to read it.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000]   Right.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.640]   January 13th, Autonomous?
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:26.200]   I feel like you could read Autonomous.
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:27.200]   You could read it, yeah.
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:28.680]   It's not a long book.
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:29.880]   It's easy to read.
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:30.720]   It's fun.
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:31.640]   It's really good.
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:32.480]   Oh, there we have it.
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:33.600]   January 13th.
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:34.120]   Autonomous.
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:35.720]   That is a Thursday.
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:37.080]   For the book club.
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:38.080]   For our book club.
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:40.400]   Oh, it's a book club at 1 PM, which
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:42.800]   means like in other parts of the world--
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:44.960]   and it's still late, but it's less late.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:45.920]   It's less late.
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.000]   It is less late.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.760]   Plus, Ant's got to schedule two people.
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:49.360]   Come on.
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:52.520]   And that will be occurring in our Discord server
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:55.320]   for Club Twitch members, but then also part of the Twitch
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:57.600]   Plus feed later if you just want to listen for Club Twitch
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:12:58.280]   members.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:01.480]   We have now, thanks to you, Ant, really starting
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:04.520]   to build up quite a library of really interesting events
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:05.000]   going on.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.280]   That's where the Entitled Linux show is, The Gizfiz, Stacey's
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:09.800]   Book Club.
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:11.960]   You interviewed Mary Jo Frigio last week.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:13.160]   That was great.
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:15.160]   We've got Mike Elgin and Amira Elgin coming up.
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:16.360]   I'm going to do that one because I've
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:17.360]   been on their gastrin.
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:18.720]   I have an idea for you.
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:20.480]   But we'll talk about it off a lot.
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.320]   If it involves singing and dancing, I'm in, buddy.
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:24.840]   Maybe.
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:26.520]   I'm in.
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:27.960]   Maybe.
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:30.880]   Can I wear a top hat and tails and my cane?
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:31.680]   And it'll be great.
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:33.360]   Make sure you bring your elf with you too.
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:36.800]   I'm putting on my top hat.
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:39.160]   So that, by the way, brings you to--
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:40.560]   Were you in theater and high school?
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:41.720]   Oh, of course.
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:42.560]   Shot plays.
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:45.400]   I can see the little thing kicking back on this thing.
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:46.040]   No, it's cute.
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:47.800]   It doesn't look great, isn't it?
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:51.000]   I was-- I played as an example, Sheridan Whiteside,
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:52.960]   and the man who came to dinner.
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:55.160]   Great dribbling cow.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:58.600]   You have the touch of a sex storm, Cobra.
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:00.200]   Oh, man, where is Shawn Luck?
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:01.600]   I was in the--
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:03.520]   Yeah, anyway.
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:06.280]   I think acting.
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:10.200]   I am a Caspian.
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:12.160]   If you are not a member of Club Twit, though,
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:14.040]   you will miss some of these fun things.
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:15.400]   So that is a good reason.
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:19.360]   Actually, there are many good reasons to join Club Twit.
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:20.200]   $7 a month.
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:20.720]   What do you get?
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:23.440]   You get ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.040]   You get access to the Discord, which
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:28.000]   is active all the time and really interesting.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.880]   And Kicker, the Twit Plus feed.
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:33.360]   Yeah, I think actually the Discord is really great.
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:37.240]   I'm just-- it's our new social life.
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:42.920]   And I think $7 a month is a pretty good deal for all of that.
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:45.120]   Go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.240]   Note also that we do have a corporate membership, too.
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:53.520]   And I mentioned that because we sold our first corporate plan.
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:54.120]   Woo hoo!
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:55.120]   300.
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:55.800]   Congratulations.
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:00.160]   Yeah, 300 IT and security professionals at RMC,
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.760]   resource management concepts.
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:02.160]   Hey.
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.960]   RMCweb.com.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:05.240]   We welcome them.
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:07.200]   David Hickman, their vice president,
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:10.520]   there is the guy who contacted us.
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:13.240]   And we said, hey, we'd be thrilled to have you.
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:14.800]   So thank you, David.
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:17.880]   And thank you to the crew.
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:23.520]   And RMC is, I think, the first to provide a corporate membership,
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:26.880]   ad-free access to our shows, particularly Security Now,
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:29.080]   for their IT and Cybersecurity workforce now
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:31.080]   through December 2022.
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:31.600]   So--
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:32.280]   It's awesome.
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:32.880]   It's really nice.
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:33.480]   Thank you so much.
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:35.320]   We love having you in the club.
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:37.200]   The club is a great resource for us,
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:38.920]   but it's also a great community for you.
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:41.120]   And thank you to Stacey and Ant and all the people
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:42.920]   who make that club so much fun.
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:43.560]   What is it, Stacey?
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:44.720]   I have breaking news.
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:45.840]   Uh-oh.
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:46.400]   Oh.
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:49.880]   Pantone has named their Color of the Year for 2022.
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:52.080]   The Color of the Year!
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:52.560]   Color of the Year!
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:54.040]   Is it the Color of your hair?
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.520]   You just change your hair color to match the Pantone?
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:15:58.000]   Oh.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:58.680]   Oh, I could.
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:00.480]   It's called Very Perry.
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:05.320]   It is periwinkle blue, so it basically looks purple, y'all.
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:07.760]   I am a big fan of the Colors of the Year.
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:08.840]   I like knowing this.
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:12.200]   So I'm sharing that with you, because I just got it.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:14.680]   Let's watch the video.
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:17.120]   Pantone announcing the color.
[02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:18.320]   Good, that's last year's colors.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:18.760]   Oh.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:19.880]   Well, what year is this?
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:22.680]   Oh, is this 2022?
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:23.520]   What's 2021?
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:25.000]   Because that was 2021.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:25.480]   OK.
[02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:26.480]   Yeah.
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:30.080]   So there is not the Color of the Past Year.
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:32.400]   It's the Color of the New Year.
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:33.200]   Yes.
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.840]   Oh, well, let's watch the video of Very Perry.
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:41.200]   You can turn up the sound, I'm sure there's--
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:42.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:42.720]   Purpleish.
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:43.840]   We're not taking down for it.
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:44.360]   Sounds.
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:45.400]   Will we get taken down?
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:46.640]   Gosh, you think they would want--
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:48.160]   Polish sounds.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:48.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:51.480]   People that talk about this.
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:53.400]   That looks very microsoftish.
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:54.000]   It's purple.
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.080]   I like it.
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:55.640]   It's purple.
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:56.320]   Yeah, I like it too.
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:56.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:57.760]   Actually, there's no sound.
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:00.760]   It's just a 15 second clip showing purple.
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:03.720]   And apparently, there are animals with fur that's that color,
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:05.920]   because that's what I'm looking at.
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:06.640]   I don't know what--
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:10.280]   I wonder if that was like a monster's ink kind of thing or what.
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:12.000]   Maybe.
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:15.160]   By the way, if you want to know, that's Pantone 17,
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:18.000]   stroke 3938.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:18.480]   Got it.
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:22.480]   And the club twit wants you to color your hair that next week.
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:24.920]   All right, in honor of Pantones.
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:25.320]   Oh.
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:27.600]   Very Perry.
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:28.720]   That's a pretty good color.
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:29.360]   I could--
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:30.240]   No, it's a pretty--
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:34.360]   I would consider it that I'm not going to go back for the full bleach
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:35.720]   and die for another couple months.
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:37.280]   Could I do a cellophane maybe?
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:40.120]   And just, you know--
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:41.120]   I'm getting my--
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:41.320]   You could do it.
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:42.600]   I'm getting my hair done tomorrow.
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:43.360]   My hair did.
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:43.840]   No.
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:44.840]   I'm getting it done tomorrow.
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:45.880]   Yeah, then you could do it.
[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:46.880]   Do it.
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:48.680]   Shall I bring in a Pantone chip?
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:50.360]   It is.
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:53.760]   Just like a little purple right here.
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:55.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:57.960]   Do you think if I tell the stylist,
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:03.360]   I want Pantones very Perry 13998 that they would know?
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:03.560]   They'll be--
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:05.840]   You should be prepared to show the video.
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:07.560]   OK, I will.
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:08.120]   I will.
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:08.960]   Get ready, Candice.
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:09.920]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:11.240]   Hold on.
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:13.960]   There is a blockchain element to this color story.
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:14.440]   Oh, boy.
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:15.480]   Oh, no.
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:16.160]   Hold on.
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:22.040]   With the help of Tazos, the energy efficient blockchain
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:25.160]   network, Pantone will begin to explore the world of color--
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:25.720]   Oh, no.
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:29.680]   --in the digital art world for the color of the year 2022,
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:32.440]   collaborating with Paris-based multidisciplinary artist
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:34.520]   Polygon 1993.
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:36.640]   They will leverage these artworks inspired
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:39.600]   by the color to create digital representations
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:42.720]   of the color and the message, the color, and bodies,
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:45.880]   inventiveness, creativity, and new ways
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:48.160]   of thinking about color.
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:49.000]   Oh, boy.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.960]   Boy, that sounds like--
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:53.960]   that's a guaranteed money maker.
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:55.120]   Ooh, gee.
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:56.520]   OK.
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:57.360]   Sorry.
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:18:59.240]   I was like, oh.
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:01.040]   Hey, just text.
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:04.600]   There's a Microsoft is in here, too.
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:07.000]   Microsoft is going to use this color in their products,
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.240]   including custom teams backgrounds.
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:10.240]   Look at this.
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:11.240]   I just--
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:12.080]   Didn't I just say it looked Microsoft?
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:13.080]   Yes.
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:14.720]   Wow.
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:16.440]   It all is coming together.
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:17.160]   Oh, boy.
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:21.680]   Did you know there's also a sauce called very perry?
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:23.000]   Oh, perry perry sauce.
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.680]   Very perry is perry perry, but it's very perry.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.160]   It's very perry.
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:30.640]   New York by way of South Africa.
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:31.640]   So--
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:32.160]   Excellent.
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:32.660]   Sorry.
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:34.240]   I know that was a huge distraction.
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:35.920]   And yet, I did it anyway.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:36.560]   We never--
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:37.400]   On this show, really?
[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:38.280]   Distractions.
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:40.280]   I know.
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:41.280]   Squirrel.
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:46.920]   You were talking about Ants thing of the week.
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:48.400]   Do you have a thing of the week?
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:52.800]   My thing of the week-- well, since we're talking sauce,
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:54.960]   I want to give a shout out to my man,
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:58.480]   Drod over in Charlotte.
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:00.880]   Story with Drod is--
[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:03.120]   he was a sports marketing guy.
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:06.560]   And he would do these nice little get-togethers and whatnot
[02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:08.400]   and decide to just do--
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:11.560]   make some sauce that his granddad used to make,
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:12.800]   because he's from South Carolina.
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:14.360]   Carolina mustard sauce.
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:16.120]   Carolina mustard sauce.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:16.720]   That's good.
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:19.480]   So people were like, man, you should sell this stuff
[02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:21.080]   a couple years ago.
[02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:24.760]   And he decided to sell it here and there.
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:26.200]   I would love some of this.
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:27.480]   It has grown.
[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:30.720]   So now he has a nice, big kitchen dedicated
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:33.040]   to producing the sauce.
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:37.000]   And it is going not the door quite regularly.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.280]   And I just wanted to give him a shout out, show him some love,
[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:41.280]   because proud of him.
[02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:44.400]   And we're happy that he's continuing to do big things
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:45.760]   and this business is growing.
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:50.080]   That's Chester's barbecue sauce using his granddaddies recipe,
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:53.480]   Chester's BBQ Sauce.com.
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:54.400]   Nice.
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:55.360]   So shout out to--
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:56.560]   I love barbecue sauce.
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:58.200]   I also know it's J-Miles.
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:00.560]   It's mustard-based barbecue sauce.
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:03.240]   The Saccio-Lana-like mustard base.
[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:04.320]   It's sacrilege.
[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:06.280]   I'm just going to tell you this right now.
[02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:07.960]   I think it sounds better than it.
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:10.600]   Is it in lieu of tomatoes or does it still have tomatoes?
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:11.080]   No.
[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:11.640]   No tomatoes.
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:12.480]   No, no tomatoes.
[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:12.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:14.120]   This sounds really good.
[02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:14.840]   I like it.
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:17.680]   I still like tomato-based better.
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:18.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:19.960]   You know, the original barbecue sauce.
[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:21.480]   Yeah, but my grandmother--
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.680]   whenever my grandmother would make barbecue,
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:25.160]   this was how she did it.
[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:26.640]   It was with mustard sauce.
[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:27.560]   All right.
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:30.080]   And my next pick is from a friend of mine
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:33.000]   and friend of the show, fan of the network.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.040]   If you could play the audio to this, I'd appreciate it.
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:38.000]   It's just something that I think people should hear
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.600]   from the voluntary input every day of gum day.
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:43.000]   Shout out to you, Mr. Leo Allen.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.960]   You may be having a tough day, but try to remember just one thing.
[02:21:46.960 --> 02:21:51.200]   Always end the day with a positive thought and a grateful heart.
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:54.120]   Try to find at least one thing to be positive about
[02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:56.720]   and at least one thing to be grateful for.
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:59.720]   Try to focus on these things because not only will it help
[02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:01.760]   you put things back into perspective,
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:05.360]   it can also help prevent you from carrying today's problems
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:07.560]   on into tomorrow.
[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:08.480]   I like it.
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:09.120]   My man.
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:11.120]   A little Wednesday wins them.
[02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:12.120]   I loved it.
[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:13.480]   They saw that this morning.
[02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:14.360]   That's good.
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:15.520]   Leo, that's good stuff, right?
[02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:17.800]   I like the name of his podcast, too.
[02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:19.480]   Never forced, never coerced.
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:23.120]   The voluntary input podcast.
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:28.040]   Compared to this, it's absolutely coerced forced.
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:30.400]   It's really, it's punishment all the way.
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:34.160]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, you must have a number of the week.
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:35.880]   Oh, yeah, I had crappy numbers.
[02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:37.280]   So I'm going to use this opportunity.
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:38.280]   This is my segment.
[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:39.240]   I own this time.
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:40.120]   This is me.
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:42.840]   I'm going to give us another TikTok video.
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.280]   Here, here.
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:44.760]   You see this.
[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:46.080]   You're here.
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:48.760]   I could go with bones, no bones, which is the trend
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:49.680]   everybody's been talking about this year.
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:51.240]   Or we could go with the laughing fox.
[02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:53.200]   I'll leave that choice to you or both.
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:53.960]   Laughing fox.
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:55.160]   It's the best.
[02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:57.320]   Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:22:58.320]   Laughing fox.
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:22:59.320]   Laughing fox.
[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:00.320]   Oh, my goodness.
[02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:01.320]   I can't even laugh.
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:02.320]   He only hit.
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:04.360]   OK, can I just say never write a fox.
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:05.360]   I have run.
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:09.320]   If I ever do that to a fox, you will regret it deeply.
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:12.200]   She's a happy fin again.
[02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:13.200]   Who's the fox?
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:14.200]   Oh, my.
[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:15.200]   Good.
[02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:16.200]   Good.
[02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:17.200]   Good.
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:18.200]   The fox.
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:19.200]   Oh, my goodness.
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:21.000]   She's talking way too much.
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.560]   And he's trying to bite her face off.
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:24.240]   I just want to point out.
[02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:25.240]   Yes.
[02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:26.960]   Good luck with that.
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:27.960]   Yeah.
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:29.960]   We actually have foxes in our backyard.
[02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:32.080]   Yeah, I don't think I'd pick them up.
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:33.840]   You don't want to go and scritch in their tummy's.
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:34.840]   No.
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:35.840]   They got to be doing that.
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:38.040]   Although, I mean, you might want to, but you shouldn't.
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:39.040]   No.
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:41.360]   And their sound is actually kind of an interesting sound.
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:43.280]   It's kind of scary, to be honest with you.
[02:23:43.280 --> 02:23:45.440]   Well, when they stop, they really make noise.
[02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:46.440]   Oh, maybe that's why.
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:47.880]   Maybe they were stopping.
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:52.080]   Because, and then there was bone crunching later, which I really didn't enjoy.
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:53.080]   OK.
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:54.720]   That's a number.
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:55.720]   Is that your number?
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:56.720]   You don't want to do it.
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:57.720]   That's my stuff.
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:58.720]   OK.
[02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:03.880]   Elon Musk, we can make fun of media for thinking that he was really asking the world if he
[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:04.880]   wanted to sell his stock.
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:07.120]   Of course, he had to sell his stock because he had options coming to.
[02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:09.120]   So he sold the stock so he could pay the taxes.
[02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:10.840]   So he owns even more stock now.
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:11.840]   Oh.
[02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:12.840]   How funny.
[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:13.920]   He owned the media again.
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:20.240]   He owns 500,000 or 64,000 more shares than he did when he sold the shares.
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:21.440]   The rich gets richer.
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:26.600]   He's exercising options to buy with the cash he makes from the shares he's selling.
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:34.360]   So he's exercising at $6.24 a share, which is 1% of its actual stock price.
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:36.600]   So in other words, it's kind of like this.
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:44.000]   If I gave you a dollar to make $100, that would be a good deal for me, for you.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.160]   All right.
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.160]   So that's what happened.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:47.160]   Wow.
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:48.600]   You know what?
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:52.120]   It's funny how the truth is different from what you need.
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:56.840]   This is the case all along, anybody with any savvy about this, but my dear friends and
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:57.840]   media support.
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:58.840]   Oh boy.
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:02.160]   We fell for it because well, we listened to him and he, that's what he said he was going
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.160]   to do.
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:04.160]   So you know, he pawns.
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:05.400]   He, he, he, he, he pawns everybody.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:06.400]   We're touching.
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:07.400]   He pawns us.
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:08.400]   Yeah.
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:10.120]   Hey, my plug, you plug barbecue sauce.
[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:12.080]   My plug is salt from my son.
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:16.120]   Oh, for the first time ever available.
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:17.120]   Get them.
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:18.120]   Not in variable and stores.
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:26.240]   You salts, Calabrian pesto flaky sea salt blend, essential flaky sea salt blend, truffle and
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:28.760]   garlic flaky sea salt blend.
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:30.000]   You will, you know what?
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.320]   This you should just not use it.
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:35.400]   Put it aside someday.
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:38.160]   It's like owning the original chef boy or decan.
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:40.960]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:44.720]   Salt hank.com salt.
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:45.720]   He's on his way, buddy.
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:47.720]   Salt hank.com. Look at that.
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:48.720]   Cachioi pepe.
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:49.720]   Beautiful.
[02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:50.720]   Mm.
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:51.720]   Mm.
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:52.720]   Mm.
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:53.720]   Mm.
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:54.720]   I love it.
[02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:55.720]   Thank you.
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:25:58.720]   The mustache is in his logo now.
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:25:59.920]   He's really stuck with it.
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:00.920]   That's permanent.
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:01.920]   Well, not just the stack.
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:02.920]   He affected.
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:05.560]   He has to barely not shave his chin too.
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:06.560]   He, this is him.
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:09.880]   He's the one of how he's been ever since he was about four or five years old.
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:10.880]   So.
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:11.880]   Yeah.
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:12.880]   Yeah.
[02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:15.880]   That's great.
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:18.320]   Anyway, thank you everybody.
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:21.960]   And thank you to our elf in the shelf, Little Leo, for welcoming me.
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:22.960]   Well done.

[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:24.960]   In the head.
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:25.960]   Nice.
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:26.960]   Let's see.
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:27.960]   Where can we find Stacey Higginbotham?
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:28.960]   That's what the world wants to know.
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:31.880]   And you'll find her at Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:33.200]   That is her website.

[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:47.560]   Wow.
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.040]   We're not this week in Google level, but for an independent podcast, high fives for Kevin
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:54.320]   and I am so proud of us.
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:55.520]   Well done.
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:56.520]   Congratulations.
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:57.520]   That's a lot of work.
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:58.520]   It is.
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:00.360]   Have you been, that sounds like you've been doing it for seven years.
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:01.360]   Is that right?
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:02.360]   Almost.
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:03.360]   Yeah.
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:07.560]   Well, seven years come April and we did it before at GigaOM, but this is 350 from the
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:08.560]   end of GigaOM.
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:09.560]   Oh, wow.
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:10.560]   All right.
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:12.920]   IRC sends its congratulations to you.
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:13.920]   That's really a big deal.
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:15.320]   Thanks, RC.
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:16.320]   Yeah.
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:22.080]   Thank you, Mr. Ant, Pruitt, twint.tv/hands on photography/hop.
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:23.080]   That's right.
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:24.080]   What should we do at the hop?
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:25.080]   What's going on at the hop?
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:29.680]   Well, this week I had the pleasure of talking to Mr. Peter Adams.
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:35.280]   He was previously on Floss Weekly because he did the faces of open source and is such
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:37.520]   a beautiful photography project.
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:38.520]   Oh, me?
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:40.400]   He's a lot of folks in the tech industry.
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:41.400]   Oh, that's neat.
[02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:43.280]   Our days of your.
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:46.200]   So I wanted to pick his brain a little bit about headshots and portraits.
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:48.040]   And it's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:49.040]   It's fantastic.
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:50.040]   Twint.tv/hop.
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:51.040]   That's right.
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:53.440]   Let's all go to the hop.
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:55.240]   That's right.
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:58.920]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, you know, we got a little song about you, Jeff.
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:01.880]   We'd like to say we don't have to do it every time.
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:02.880]   That's okay.
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:07.360]   Jeff is the director of the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:14.960]   Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:18.120]   Frank Sinatra called him a bum former TV guy critic.
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:20.920]   Ray Crock called him a nickel millionaire.
[02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:24.240]   He's our one and only king of the moral panic.
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:25.240]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:26.240]   King of the world.
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:27.240]   Good man.
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:28.240]   Good man.
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:29.680]   I like that.
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:30.920]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:33.080]   I love doing this show every Wednesday.
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:37.320]   It's a great capper to my week because I don't work on Thursday and Friday.
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:44.560]   We hope you will come back every Wednesday around 2 p.m.
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:48.000]   Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000]   The live audio and video streams are live.twint.tv.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:55.560]   If you're watching live, you can chat live at IRC.twint.tv.
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:57.560]   That's open to all club twit members.
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:58.560]   Welcome to chat.
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:28:59.560]   This is chord two.
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:00.560]   We pay attention to both.
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:04.560]   On-demand versions of the show available at twint.tv/twig.
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:08.120]   There's also a YouTube channel dedicated to this week in Google so you can watch the
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:09.840]   video there.
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:13.400]   Probably the easiest thing to do audio or video is subscribe in your favorite podcast
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:14.760]   client.
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:16.920]   No charge for doing that.
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:18.820]   Just get a client.
[02:29:18.820 --> 02:29:22.480]   Search for twig or twit and you can add all the twit shows if you want.
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:24.520]   That way you'll get them the minute they're available.
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:27.520]   And please do leave us a five star review if you think of it.
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:30.080]   It would sure help us spread the word.
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:31.080]   Thank you everybody.
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:32.080]   Have a great week.
[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:34.200]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:35.200]   Ooh.
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:40.480]   Android is constantly evolving.
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:45.040]   And if you're part of the Android faithful, then you'll be just as excited about it as
[02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:46.040]   I am.
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:50.080]   I'm Jason Howell, host of All About Android, along with my co-hosts Florence Ion and Ron
[02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:55.600]   Richards, where every week we cover the news, we cover the hardware, and we cover the apps
[02:29:55.600 --> 02:29:57.880]   that are driving the Android ecosystem.
[02:29:57.880 --> 02:30:02.600]   Plus, we invite people who are writing about Android, talking about Android, and making
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:04.800]   Android onto the show.
[02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:07.880]   Every Tuesday at twit.tv, look for All About Android.
