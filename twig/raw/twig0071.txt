[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.960]   to show the covers Google, the cloud, and really kind of everything
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.360]   going on on the internet joining us.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.720]   As always, we're so glad to have Gina Trapani with her new hairdo
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.920]   and her new lights and her new job.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.800]   Me and my bangs.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.200]   Mardewear.org is the blog.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.120]   And we'll talk about-- it's not a new job,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.400]   but full time at the job, which is exciting.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.680]   Good to have you here, Gina.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.280]   Also with us, the pink and lovely freshly bathed Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.520]   Oh, man.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.760]   But he's--
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.480]   Gina has a new hair.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   Do I have new skin?
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.960]   We'll fix that.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.400]   Oh, that's scary about last three.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.320]   We'll fix it in post.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.120]   We can make that better.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.920]   Yeez.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.280]   Well, the funny thing is, is if I send it for the wall being
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   a crew, then you--
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.080]   So you're the wall.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.280]   Pay attention to me.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.680]   OK, all right.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.200]   Yeah, really.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.280]   Let's let the wall color.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.640]   I can't.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   There's nothing I can do with you.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.880]   Make it black and white or something.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.160]   Nothing I can do with you.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.000]   You're just-- look.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.320]   You're hopeless, Jeff.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.920]   You're hopeless.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.760]   Is his monitor?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   What color would you like to be, Jeff?
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.960]   The peanut gallery's giving me-- now he's blue.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.280]   It's not easy.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.000]   There's no-- unfortunately, there's
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.200]   no flesh color in there.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   There's no flesh tones.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.080]   It's either pink or blue.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.520]   You look like a smurf there.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.360]   Oh!
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.040]   Don't touch it.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.120]   Don't touch it.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.960]   Human.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.600]   Human color.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.480]   It's a human on the other side.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.400]   I pushed a button.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.040]   Good to have you, Jeff.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.160]   Buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.640]   Oh, look.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.160]   There he is.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.240]   Matt cuts in the lower left corner to block.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.720]   Matt is actually an official Googler.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.480]   He's in charge of blocking web spam
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.040]   on the Google search results.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.800]   What a smooth transition Leo.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.300]   Woo!
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.800]   That's right.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.920]   You're the professional broadcaster.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.440]   Woo!
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.320]   And Matt is at mattcuts.com/blog, if you want to read his blog.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.560]   Actually, Google just blogged about the story of the week.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.360]   We had a lot of fun with it on Twitch.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.320]   The New York Times story that came out on Sunday
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.120]   about the guy who was really gaming Google
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.040]   by generating negative customer response.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.200]   Well, he said he was.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.160]   But is it true to start off with Matt
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.200]   that it doesn't matter how he's spelled the name as long
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.480]   as he spelled the name, gets you page rank?
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.920]   Let me just recap the story a little bit.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.320]   It's one of the best newspaper stories
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.960]   I've read in a long time.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.800]   In fact, this was one of the things
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.720]   we talked about on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   This is the Dwight Silverman who writes for the Houston Chronicle
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.800]   said, you get one of these every five years where you just go.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.120]   This is going to be such a great story.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.440]   The reporter goes to the guy's house in Brooklyn.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.920]   He's got this book on an accent.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.840]   And he says, I don't care what they think.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.560]   And he flips off his customers and he yells at them
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.840]   and he calls them names.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.440]   He threatens to come to their house.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.280]   He sells designer eyewear.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.000]   Well, sales isn't probably the right word.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.640]   He has a website purporting to sell designer eyewear.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.040]   But in fact, it seems a lot of times you don't--
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.520]   you get something you didn't expect.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.800]   You get overcharged.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.480]   And he says, I don't care because people
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.520]   go to get satisfaction.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.280]   They complain about me.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.760]   And my Google juice goes up.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.480]   They talk about one of his customers
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.720]   who bought her frames from him because he was the number one
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.560]   result when she entered in the frame name.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.880]   Now, early on, Google said, well,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.520]   but if you enter in the name of the company,
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.680]   we're not going to name the company.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.760]   What should we use Gina as a euphemism for this company?
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.120]   I echo my eyes.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.960]   It's probably a good--
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.200]   It's a bad Jackson Brown pun is what it is.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.000]   Really bad.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.440]   But anyway, apparently all the evituperation on get satisfaction
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.240]   is just more links and get satisfaction
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.320]   as a highly rated blog.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.080]   So it gets just more links back to his website.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.920]   And apparently Google interprets that as interest
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.360]   and ranks him highly.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.280]   So there in a nutshell is the story from the New York Times.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.560]   And it was a great read and it's well worth reading.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.560]   Now, Google just posted a response today on the blog.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.760]   Matt?
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.800]   I can walk you through it.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.760]   It's really funny because the first thing we did in that blog
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.840]   post is we wanted to sort of pop the misconception
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.840]   that it was all these complaints that we're giving them
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.680]   a lot of benefit in the Google rankings.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.320]   Because that's not really what was happening.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.360]   In fact, get satisfaction, Thor, the guy
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.120]   that you might know from get satisfaction,
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   did a blog post.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.600]   And we had a link to that.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.160]   And he said, we used the nofollow attribute
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.520]   of all hyperlinks.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520]   So they were--
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.000]   So you use low-hatred.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.440]   If you use in the link after the URL,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.120]   if you use R-E-L equals nofollow,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.640]   Google takes that as an indication not
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.640]   to use that in its indexing.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.120]   That's right.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.120]   We drop the link.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.620]   OK.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.720]   Yeah, we don't use it in PageRank.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.360]   We don't trust the anchor text.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.360]   So it's a perfect way.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's actually almost five years old now.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.280]   It's a very general mechanism to say, you know what?
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.360]   I don't endorse this link.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.400]   And it turns out almost all of the consumer complaint sites
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.640]   either didn't link to the site or only use the text name
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.560]   or use the rel nofollow.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.000]   The ironic part is some of the most reputable links coming
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.960]   to the site were coming from Bloomberg.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.400]   And wait for it.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.960]   The New York Times.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.760]   Well, he even says, the guy who owns the company even
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.880]   says, at the end, it's a great end to the--
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.240]   he says, hey, it's OK if you write them out.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.960]   I mean, just make sure you include my URL's and names
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.160]   in the article.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.560]   Say anything you want.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.800]   So really, all the attention he got from the press
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.360]   is what helped him.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.480]   Well, he was doing relatively well even before that.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.960]   His pet theory was that he was getting a lot of negative
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.040]   mentions.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.360]   If he was doing well in the last month or two,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.640]   it might be because Bloomberg wrote an article that
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.440]   mentioned that company was getting sued
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.600]   and in the process they linked to him.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.080]   Now, one of the easy things you would think is, oh, well,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.680]   just look for people who are really angry, the sentiment
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.800]   analysis.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.600]   And it turns out that wouldn't have worked at all,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.120]   because the Bloomberg article was completely neutral.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.040]   It just said, yeah, this company is suing this other company.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.160]   So it was really more a few fashion blogs, a few mainstream
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.240]   news sources.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.800]   It really wasn't the sort of hate from consumers that
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.160]   was giving it a lot of Google ranking.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.560]   Now, Jeff, you wrote in your blog, Buzzmachine.com.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.000]   Kind of taking off the title of your book,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.360]   What Should Google Do About This?
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   What should Google--
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.720]   how should Google respond to this?
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.520]   Now, of course, this might change knowing now that it wasn't
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   coming from get satisfaction.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:03.880]   Right.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.280]   But there were a lot of people who said, who blamed Google
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:07.840]   for this.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.280]   And the first point, I think, is that we do live in a world
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.960]   of caveat emptor.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.680]   And it is up to the consumer to figure out what's what.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.720]   So that when I had my Dell problems,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:25.000]   I kicked myself at the time for not searching on Dell Sucks.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And so I learned a big lesson there.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.640]   And whenever I buy something from a new vendor online, I check
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:29.800]   it.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.960]   And if you go to-- if you searched for the vendor's name,
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.560]   Eagle My Eyes, and we'll say, you saw, as Matt had pointed out
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.000]   in Twitter, lots and lots and lots of negative stuff,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.040]   you would have known to stay away from this guy if you just
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.000]   searched for the vendor's name.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.040]   But that isn't really the fault of a consumer.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.480]   Yeah, it is.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.040]   Calvian emptor sure it is.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.360]   Is it Google's job to ferret out every bad guy on Earth?
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.960]   Matt has enough time trying to play whack-a-mole with just
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.680]   spamsters, which you also try to ferret out everybody
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.000]   who might be bad.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   That's not Google's job.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.800]   It's an unscalable task.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.360]   We don't necessarily want Google to do it,
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.880]   because somebody else is bad store or somebody's good store.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   It just doesn't work at all.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.080]   And so then the next question is, Matt said,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.440]   do you look at sentiment analysis, even apart
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.360]   from this question of the Bloomberg story,
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.320]   as somebody said in Twitter when this discussion was
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.560]   going underway, well, if they use sentiment analysis,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.960]   they'd see a lot of negative links to Barack Obama.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.880]   What does that mean?
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.600]   Right.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.280]   What do you do with vaccines?
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.920]   Or I should Bloomberg and the New York Times
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.880]   have used the realm no follow attribute?
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.320]   I mean, if they're trying to be-- if they're
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.960]   reporting a neutral story about one company suing another,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.360]   I mean, I know that this is probably--
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.400]   this is never going to happen.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.720]   But I mean, if I'm making a recommendation on my site,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.000]   then I'm not going to use the no follow.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.400]   But if Bloomberg is just writing this neutral story,
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.520]   I mean, would that have helped?
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   Doesn't that just build in sentiment analysis, though?
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.720]   I mean, don't you want, in most cases, not to use
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.640]   realm no follow?
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.480]   Don't we want links?
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.640]   Yeah, you do want links.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.160]   And the web is very good at having links.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.360]   I don't think that Bloomberg should necessarily
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.720]   have been responsible.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.960]   We just wanted to dispel the misconception
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.760]   that it was all people complaining
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.240]   on the consumer sites that was causing it.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.880]   But what was kind of interesting is, to Jeff's point,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.120]   if you just allow people who say, oh, this is bad,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.640]   to hurt someone, then you can seriously impact their rankings,
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.520]   then you have to worry about people who don't like vaccines,
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.560]   people who don't like either Barack Obama or Sarah Palin.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.280]   And that sort of stuff could really
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   have unintended consequences.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.160]   Google does not want to get in that business by any means.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.040]   And that's what's called sentiment analysis.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.800]   And that's not--
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.200]   Does Google do any sentiment analysis?
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.560]   We do, actually.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.920]   We have a link in the blog post where we do sentiment analysis
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.640]   for news and for blogs.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.320]   And there could be a place for that.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.880]   But the main thing we wanted to get across
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.520]   is that just that alone wouldn't have done the job.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.400]   And in fact--
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.200]   Let me ask you something, because on Sunday,
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.960]   I did a search for this--
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.520]   I tried to duplicate the search that the protagonist
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.320]   and the story of the woman who got ripped off by this company
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.520]   did and was not able to get a link to this company.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.520]   Did Google delisted it?
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.480]   I was lucky enough to have a front row seat.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.720]   And what happened is the algorithmic change--
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.080]   and we made an algorithmic change.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.440]   It affected several hundred sites, not just this one site--
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.840]   went live late last night.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.320]   Oh, interesting.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.000]   So if you weren't seeing it Sunday night,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.320]   then that was something different.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.000]   Maybe the site was down.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.520]   OK.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.680]   There has been a change since then.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.880]   Does Google do that a lot?
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.840]   Well, we do roll out over 400 changes a year.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.960]   So we do average about one change.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.880]   We're a little more than one change per day.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.040]   To be able to get feedback and within a couple business days
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.720]   come up with some new algorithm that
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.960]   would improve the search results for that kind of experience.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.480]   That is pretty quick.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.440]   But we read through the article and we were just
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.360]   as horrified as everybody else.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:02.720]   So--
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   I'll bet.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.080]   That was a fun weekend for you guys.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.760]   That's amazing.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.120]   More than one change per day is unbelievable.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.960]   I mean, what is-- as an engineer,
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.480]   I'm just like, what does a regression test look like?
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.920]   I mean, when you change the algorithm,
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.000]   you want to avoid unintended consequences
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.960]   changing other kinds of searches.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.840]   It must be an insane test suite that you run before you roll out.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.240]   Or how does that work?
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.520]   Is it continual testing that just runs constantly
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.240]   as the changes roll out and tweaking?
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.920]   Or I'd love to know.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.600]   Probably we could dedicate a whole show to Google's
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.920]   search algorithm testing and deploy a system.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.440]   Right.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.520]   Well, and we do have continuous testing.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.440]   So if something really happens to drop one important site
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.720]   or a high impact site, we sort of get pages about that.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.120]   But whenever you want to roll out a new change,
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.800]   essentially we also-- for example, for this change,
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.080]   we ran something like a couple hundred thousand queries
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.160]   to see how big of an impact that one small change would have.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   So even though the algorithm only affected maybe a few hundred
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.040]   sites, we ran several hundred thousand queries
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.480]   to sort of make sure that the impact was relatively
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.800]   limited in scope.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.200]   And then we also have a manual team
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.920]   who sort of picks on the individual sites that
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.880]   might be affected and sort of confers and says, yes,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.120]   this is a bad experience.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.520]   So for example, I was lucky enough to sort of see
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.520]   some of the testing.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.400]   There was another merchant who, if you
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.800]   search for Dead Kennedy's trucker hat,
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.440]   these really specific queries, you think you're ordering from them.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.840]   But when you place the order, they
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.640]   would actually go and try to find the product on the web
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.840]   and order it at that point.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.400]   So they were--
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.320]   So they were-- they were--
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.520]   pages with a bunch of bizarre queries in them,
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.920]   hoping to catch your spider.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.320]   It's definitely the case that if you have a really specific,
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.600]   what we call a long tail query, it's
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.000]   a little easier to rank for that.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.680]   So one phrase that was mentioned was discount
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.400]   La Fonte glasses.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.960]   It turns out if you do an exact phrase search for that using
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.840]   double quotes, that only happens on the web like 15 times.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.960]   Like Bing finds it maybe six times.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.560]   So if you have those words on your page,
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.600]   it's not that hard to rank for that phrase.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.520]   Although I have to say Google predict when I did it,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.760]   when I read right to it.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   Even suggested eyeglasses eyeglasses eyeglass frames
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.640]   as a completion for discount La Fonte.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.400]   Pretty impressive.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.560]   So Matt, explain the other part of this.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.520]   Just philosophically that you know and Gina and Leo know,
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.560]   but I think that people don't quite understand
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.680]   is the issue of manually intervening
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.120]   and how if you went, OK, OK, this guy's bad.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.680]   So fine, we'll get rid of him.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.840]   And not only does that not scale,
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.600]   but it's just not the way it kind of violates the law here
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.000]   that the algorithm is then no longer the same to all.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.160]   Right.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.440]   That's a great point in that while it is the case
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.120]   that we do reserve the right to take manual action
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.640]   in very limited circumstances, if it's web spam,
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.040]   that's my team, if we have a court order,
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.280]   if there's something security related like viruses or malware,
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.400]   really the idea of taking manual action,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.240]   you have to realize that's not always scalable.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.080]   It might not work in other languages, for example.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.640]   So what we try to do is to a first approximation,
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.200]   we try to find the algorithms that are going to work well.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   And I can give you a quick story to sort of demonstrate
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.920]   that two years ago, the pendulum was swinging the other way.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.400]   There was a guy who wrote a story that a kid had borrowed
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.840]   his dad's credit card number and had hired two hookers.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.400]   But the hookers were supposed to be playing Xbox with him.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.600]   Aww.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.120]   And so it was like my son.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.520]   Yeah, he was, you know, let's play Xbox together.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.480]   I totally want to play Xbox with hookers.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.080]   That sounds fun.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.040]   Connect essentially.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.000]   Doesn't that sound fun?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.440]   That's my answer to the answer.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.400]   Okay.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.720]   Connect is a good idea, Gina.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.160]   You've just invented a new form of porn.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:56.920]   Right?
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.400]   So it's like the hoax could not have been better constructed
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.560]   to get links.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.880]   And in fact, I think Fox News picked up
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.840]   that particular hoax.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.840]   It was a surprise.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.000]   And after it had gotten traction, the guy came out and said,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.440]   "Yeah, by the way, I totally made that up."
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.880]   So then people are saying, "Well, it's not fair."
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.320]   You know, people are allowing these guys to basically lie.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.320]   Oh, you know, hoax marketing.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.760]   And so I basically did a blog post two years ago that said,
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.920]   "Look, if someone's doing a link scheme,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.000]   we do reserve the right to take action on it.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.160]   And that can include, you know, limited situations
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.480]   where someone's--
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.160]   Uh-oh.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.160]   He's frozen.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.360]   Look at that.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.600]   Oh, mid-sentence.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.480]   What do you think he was going to say?
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.480]   Let's have a game.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.640]   We'll complete Matt's phrase.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.240]   I love he has the hand movement going on.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   It's like really--
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   He's going to say, "And I really like Bing."
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   No.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   You lose.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.080]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.080]   Poor Matt.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.800]   Poor Matt.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.560]   He's on his wife's Mac.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.800]   And it's probably on Wi-Fi.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.400]   We're going to actually-- while I'm getting him back,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.800]   when I would take a break, I love this subject.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.560]   And you're right, we could go on forever.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.800]   And this is, I guess, what Matt does, really.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.240]   A lot of what he does day in day out is, hey, welcome back, Matt.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.720]   Sorry about that.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.160]   What also relates to the EU thing, which we should talk about, too.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.280]   So I was just saying, this is probably a lot of what you
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.800]   do on a day to day basis, Matt.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.960]   Is this kind of looking for these kinds of flaws?
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.800]   I mean, I wouldn't call that link bait a spam, precisely.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.240]   Or would you?
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.760]   Would Google call that spam?
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.080]   Well, that's where the pendulum sort of went all the way
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.880]   to one extent.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.240]   Because as soon as we said, we were
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.760]   willing to take action in that very specific circumstance.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.720]   The people started shouting about the other direction,
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.800]   saying Google shouldn't be the truth police.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.360]   And that's totally true.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.800]   We don't want to be in the position of saying, this is correct,
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.600]   or this is not correct.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.840]   We really just want to reflect.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.640]   Oh, he's gone again.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.800]   Jeff, what you say in your blog post
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.920]   is that as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other private players
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.640]   come to be the law of the land on the internet--
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.880]   and that's what the real issue is here.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.280]   Is the responsibility that they carry.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.680]   They need to start acting like public players.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.640]   And you want to say, let's make it explicit with constitutions,
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.080]   bills of rights, the means of enforcement.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.480]   Yeah, because as Larry Leisick says, code is law.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.480]   And we're seeing that to be the case here.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.120]   And I don't want the government really to do it,
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.600]   but they've got to do it based on principles of some form
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.240]   or another.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.760]   And I've argued for the Bill of Rights.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   But I think if you're Google, they've
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.520]   gotten into hot water of sorts.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.680]   When a company-- there was a company, for example,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.880]   that was downgraded as a spammer.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.480]   And they came in and said, no, we're a business directory.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.240]   And frankly, if you and I looked at it,
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.640]   we'd say, yeah, that looks like spam.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.800]   But Google said, yeah, spam.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.880]   Well, then they took them to court.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.200]   And that's kind of the basis of what's happening with Google
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.240]   and the EU.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.240]   The EU is just announced a few days ago
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.520]   that they're going to investigate Google for antitrust
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.320]   with these kinds of cases.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.400]   Well, the problem here is that what Google does
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:02.240]   have the manual adjudication to say, you're a spammer.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.000]   You're not legitimate site.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.640]   And so when they do that, it's the one case where they kind of
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.040]   do operate in monopoly power.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.840]   And my argument is that what they should have
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.280]   is a different adjudication structure.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.840]   They should have a jury appear.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.600]   Yes, I agree.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.080]   I think that's what's missing.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.680]   Some form of-- well, we've talked about before,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.440]   Google needs an ombudsman.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.280]   But some form of third party adjudication,
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.640]   I think would be avoid the course.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.520]   Yeah, I don't want it to be government.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.040]   No.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.640]   Eric Spitz says, a government got to run Google better
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.280]   than Google does.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.120]   No.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.600]   But I think that it's in-- the question here
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.720]   is to look at where the interests are aligned.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.200]   Let's say you had 12 business people who
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.160]   run businesses and use Google to do so.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.240]   It's in their interest to have Google send to legitimate
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.480]   businesses like them.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.360]   It's in the customer's interest to have this happen.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.400]   And it's in Google's interest.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.680]   The only one who's now aligned from that
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.320]   is the scum bucket who's spamming.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.560]   And so the question of is this spam or is it not?
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.640]   Is it illegitimate or is it not?
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.840]   Now rests solely in Google's hands,
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.840]   either through algorithm or judgment.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.760]   And that's what gets Google in trouble now
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.040]   with its huge market share given to it
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.360]   by European consumers.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.760]   Let's be quick to say.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.120]   And so the EU comes in and says, oh, no, monopoly.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.320]   Well, it's not.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.960]   The irony of the EU going after Google
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.040]   is Google set the rules for ethical search results.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.920]   Before Google was overture and overture sold placement.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.920]   So Google came along and cleaned that up.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.000]   And now the EU is coming in saying,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.440]   well, you dared a point to your own stuff, like YouTube.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.520]   Well, Danny Sullivan did a really good, really smart-asked
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.240]   post.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.200]   I hope I didn't get the dump button for that.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.680]   In which he said, I searched for cars on Google.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   It didn't send me to Bing's car page.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.280]   How dare they?
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.560]   It sent me straight to cars.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.520]   And so Google's in an unfortunate position
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.280]   with a lot of this.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.960]   And I think it has to figure out how to stand on principle.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.840]   Its algorithms, in its view, I think,
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.360]   Madel, correct me here, are its principle.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.360]   But in cases of manual adjudication,
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.200]   it needs to have somebody to hide behind.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.000]   And it needs to have more transparency,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.920]   not about the algorithm, but about these kinds
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.160]   of rules and how this operates.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.720]   In the best of all worlds, Google
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.920]   wouldn't be in the content business.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.720]   And then you would avoid this conflict of interest entirely.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.520]   If it were just--
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.000]   They don't want to be in the content business.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.440]   I don't want them in the content business.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.440]   But YouTube is the content business.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.880]   Well, that is, yes.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.960]   Well, wait a second.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.480]   Is it or isn't it?
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.760]   YouTube is another platform for content.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.040]   Google is not a producer of content there.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:44.840]   Yeah, but OK.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   But if-- well, yeah.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.640]   It's difficult.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.440]   I mean, it's really what is the business of Google.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.600]   And if you wanted it to be pure, it would have to be search,
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.800]   not ads.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.320]   Well, no, but Google is more than search.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.280]   If Google points back at an ad page of its own,
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.560]   then it's making revenue off a search result,
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.280]   then that's where you get this conflict of interest.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.120]   Yeah, but hold on a second there.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.760]   So by that logic, then Leo, then the New York Times
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.760]   should never point to another New York Times story.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.160]   It should only point to Washington Post
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.480]   and Wall Street Journal stories.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.000]   Good point.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.160]   And of course, you point to your own stuff.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.600]   I sat in meetings with Jerry Yang way back
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.800]   in the premature days when he was still there and you could.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.720]   And they bragged Yahoo about how we have this fire hose
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.000]   we can point to our stuff.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.120]   They know also the same thing.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.800]   So hello, EU.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.000]   What's so wrong with going ahead and pointing to your own stuff
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   when you build an asset?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.680]   Everybody does that.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.600]   And I know I come off like Google fanboy,
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.640]   and Matt can sit there quietly and say, oh, good.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.360]   Jarvis is the one defending people.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.640]   I don't have to.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.000]   It's just the truth of life.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   It's there's this in Europe, especially now,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.880]   there's this anti-Googleism that strikes me
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.480]   as anti-Americanism and in some stripes, anti-capitalism.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.320]   And so when you see stories like the New York Times story,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.440]   it gets everybody riled up to say, aha, Google
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.040]   caused this problem.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.960]   But it didn't.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.080]   Well, I thought the story was interesting
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.960]   that they also talked about MasterCard and eBay.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.000]   And this guy was clearly someone who
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.360]   sees how close he can get to the edge, right up
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.520]   to the threshold.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.440]   Yeah, and the story actually--
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.200]   the woman calls her credit card company disputes it.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.040]   The company puts the pay in and on hold.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.760]   And then apparently somebody from the company
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.840]   called the credit card company and say, no, no, this
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.760]   is the customer.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.720]   And I want to pay that bill.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.880]   This guy was a piece of work, really.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.840]   It's one of the most--
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.000]   Pulitzer Prize, for sure.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.960]   It's a great story.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.440]   I just love it.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.160]   But-- and you make the point, I think, Jeff very well--
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.840]   perhaps the reporter would have done better to call Matt
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.400]   cuts.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   Well, and I think that's a problem that Google frankly had.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.840]   Because I'm very serious about that, is that Matt--
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.320]   what this-- forget about defending Google.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.400]   There were questions that we're talking about right now.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.680]   But what does this mean?
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.720]   What's the next step?
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.200]   How can you stop this?
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.320]   That a good reporter would go to?
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.080]   And the reporter whined in the story
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.880]   that they talked to a Google spokesperson who
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.800]   did the phone call, was posted to send an email and didn't.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.360]   I hate it when reporters complained
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.960]   about PR people not being nice to them.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.200]   But the mistake there was that I think that the better story
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.800]   would have been if Matt had been able to talk to the reporter
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.480]   and just talk through these issues, these what ifs.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.040]   Well, if we did manually go in, what happens?
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.920]   If we did look at the sentiment, what happens?
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.720]   Because it's a better, fuller story.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.160]   And that's why we wanted to--
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.320]   Yeah, the blog post out.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   I get the blog post out.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.160]   Go ahead, Gina.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.560]   The post really addressed the issues
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.040]   that the sentiment analysis point was very good.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.280]   It really addressed a lot of issues.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.000]   But in the end, the post didn't say
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.880]   what the changes that Google made,
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.440]   because Google does have to protect that information
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.120]   to make it less able to be game in the end.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.560]   And it took a couple of days for the post to come out as well.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.880]   So yeah, the story would have been much better
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.280]   if the reporter had followed up a little more.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.680]   I don't know if the story would have been better,
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.080]   but it would have been more accurate.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.480]   It would have been more accurate.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.400]   It would have been more accurate.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.600]   I mean, the fact that the reporter
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.320]   wasn't able to see that the times had linked this company.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   Right.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.040]   Well, and if you view source, you'll see rel=nofollow.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.160]   He didn't have enough technical sophistication
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.120]   to even do that.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.520]   Although I confess, I repeated his story
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.640]   without checking myself.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.760]   So that's probably the first thing we should all have done
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.600]   is, and then it's apparent, there's no link juice at all.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.880]   I mean, the nofollow issue in terms of the responsibility
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.320]   on news organizations to, if you're truly
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.600]   going to be neutral when you mention something
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.000]   versus wanting someone to read it.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.840]   That's interesting, isn't it?
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.560]   Interesting question.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.480]   I mean, what we get to the point where news organizations
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.560]   are tech savvy enough to know what nofollow means?
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.520]   Like, this is a neutral link, and this is a link
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520]   we're recommending.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.960]   I don't know, we're getting down to nitty gritty,
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.400]   but it's interesting question.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.640]   I'm trying to remember, I think Twitter
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.840]   started implementing rel=nofollow globally.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.640]   And I think that that's a bad idea, because--
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.680]   Do they still do that, Matt?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   Do you know?
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.440]   They do, certainly, on their website.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.680]   And if you're a beginning website
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.360]   and you're not ready for the spammer influx
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.200]   and you have a lot of people, that
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.360]   can be a very reasonable thing to do.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.800]   What I would love to see people do
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.600]   is be a little more nuanced.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.480]   For example, I just crossed 10,000 tweets.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.000]   And so the odds that I'm going to do some spam tweets
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.880]   are pretty low.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.160]   Maybe let you add a jail, for instance.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.080]   Yeah, once you've been around for a while
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.640]   or you have someone else who's trusted,
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.560]   vouch for you, or any other metric that you have,
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.480]   you know, you just--
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.560]   Because Wikipedia, maybe you edited
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.200]   and you didn't get reverted, you could remove those.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.000]   Because rel=nofollow really neuters the web.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.480]   It neuters the ability to generate links.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.200]   In fact, it hurts Google's ability
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.880]   to generate valuable page rank.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.080]   I mean, a link from Twitter from a highly regarded person
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.720]   on Twitter should be valuable.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.320]   It should add to the Google juice.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:44.680]   Should it--
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.480]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.840]   And Twitter has its own internal algorithm
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.560]   for user authority.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.800]   And I think that that should come into play.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.880]   I mean, it neuters the web if everyone uses no follow.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.120]   But if we use it smartly--
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:53.640]   Right.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.600]   --and people understand the difference between a neutral link
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.480]   and I want you to click on this link,
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.200]   that it would stop spamming.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.680]   It would help badness team.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.240]   Sorry, wouldn't that help reduce the ROI?
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:04.720]   Right.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.240]   Sorry, Jake.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.040]   Go ahead.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.560]   Wouldn't that be helped if the tools enabled you
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.720]   to put in two kinds of links?
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.800]   We've had this discussion before about positive or negative.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.320]   Maybe it's recommended or neutral.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.960]   Is it a decent way to go that people can--
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.120]   there's a little link tool on your blog tool.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:21.640]   Right?
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.800]   There's a little link button on your blog tool.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.360]   And similarly, you put a link into Twitter and then shorten it.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.880]   Maybe you have two shortening options.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.400]   Right.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.640]   Bitly, bit no.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.160]   You know?
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   Sorry.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160]   Click me.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.600]   Don't be right here.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.760]   But that kind of nuance at this point in time is probably
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.240]   just the usability-wise is--
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.160]   A lot of work.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.600]   A lot of work.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.920]   Bear in mind that it took about five years
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.800]   before we introduced no follow because, for the most part,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.000]   when people link to something, it's because they do endorse it
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.120]   or they do like it or they want people to see it.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.840]   So it took a few years before we really even saw a need to say,
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.880]   hey, there are some links where maybe if you run WordPress,
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.960]   you might want to put no follow-on commenters
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.320]   until you trust them or something.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.320]   Yeah, I think that's the right issue.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.680]   The other interesting thing here is in Europe,
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.120]   at least in the UK, as I understand it,
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.440]   you can be held responsible for that to which you link
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.320]   in a court of law.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.080]   Wow.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.560]   And it would be really nice if you could have a form of link
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.160]   that says, I am definitely not endorsing this,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.280]   but in the interest of free speech,
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.720]   I'm showing you where the Bozo is, which is part of what we
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.800]   need to be able to do on the web, too, is otherwise it does
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.760]   turn into an echo chamber.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.680]   If all I can do is link to those things that I think
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.880]   are good and worthwhile and I recommend,
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.960]   it becomes a very boring place.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.120]   Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani, Matt Cutz from Google,
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.200]   talking about Google and the cloud, from Kevin Marks,
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.720]   a link about the boring couple.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.760]   They both won and lost in court today,
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.720]   and we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.080]   But first, I'd like to talk a little bit about Ford
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.560]   and Ford Sync, the amazing technology that's in many
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.360]   Ford motor cars and Lincoln and Mercury vehicles as well.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.760]   It's just fantastic.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.400]   It's hands-free calling, turn-by-turn directions.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.680]   You get full GPS even without the GPS screen.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.560]   It'll walk you through.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.600]   In fact, the turn-by-turn is so smart.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.760]   It knows where you're going.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.680]   It watches traffic alerts, and it'll reroute you
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.360]   around traffic problems automatically.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.000]   911 assist and, of course, complete control of your
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.560]   audio system, including things like play this week
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.480]   in Google number 71.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.000]   And boom, plays for you.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I just love it.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.120]   These Ford Sync vehicles come with a USB port
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.200]   so you can connect your iPod or your Zoom or your phone.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.160]   They come with just the most amazing voice recognition
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.040]   software.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.560]   And in fact, with some phones, including my Android phones
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.120]   and the Windows Phone 7 phones, it'll even read you text
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.160]   messages as they come in.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.000]   You want to give it a try.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Go to your local Ford, Lincoln or Mercury dealer,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.480]   and test drive the Ford Sync.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.240]   It is fantastic.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.960]   And I'll tell you, I wouldn't consider a car that didn't
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.000]   have it from now on.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.240]   That's it.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.600]   And here's a new program from Ford.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   We're kind of excited about it.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.160]   It's the 2012 Ford Focus Global Test Drive.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.920]   Here comes the new Focus.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.160]   Early 2011, the 2012 Ford Focus is going to come out.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.720]   Three model lineup, the five-door hatchback, the four-door
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.240]   sedan, the five-door wagon.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.400]   I saw it at Blog World.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.200]   It is so beautiful, so slick.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.280]   This is the new world car from Ford.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.680]   And it includes just the latest parking technologies
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.680]   like the Active Park Assist, like on the Flex,
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.520]   where it parks itself, the rear view camera.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.400]   So I mean, I got that on the Mustang.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.840]   I can't-- I don't know how people live with that.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.400]   Do I get in the car without a rear view camera?
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.120]   I go, how do you back up here?
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.920]   What are you-- what are we doing?
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.360]   It's scary.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.120]   The new fuel-efficient engines completely updated,
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.360]   including a torque vector control system, which
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.400]   hugs the curves.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.520]   The new Mi 4 Touch, which is Sync Plus.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.800]   It's got the eight-inch screen on the center console,
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.640]   and then the two screens behind the steering wheel.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.520]   I can go on and on.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.360]   You could be one of the first to test drive
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   the new 2012 Ford Focus in Madrid.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.200]   At Spain's National Institute for Aerospace Technology.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.400]   Yes, it's a contest.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.040]   Go to twitfordfocus.com.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.240]   I'll take you to the Facebook page,
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.360]   where you can make a video up to two minutes in length
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.560]   saying two things-- why you should be one of the first to test
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.360]   drive the Ford Focus, and where you'd
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.160]   like the $10,000 to go.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.760]   What charity you'd like the $10,000 to go to.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.320]   Ford's going to give away half a million dollars in all.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.880]   Take many-- a couple of-- you and a friend,
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.640]   and I guess I'll be many winners,
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.760]   two Madrid to test drive the Ford Focus.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.880]   And this is the thing I like best.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.040]   This contest is open to our audience members
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.680]   everywhere in the world.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.120]   You're all invited to participate.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.000]   Go to twitfordfocus.com.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.760]   Tell us what charitable cause you'd like to support,
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.640]   and then why you should be on your way to Madrid early
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.400]   next year to test the 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.720]   The global test drive is on twitfordfocus.com.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.120]   We thank Ford so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.080]   Thank you, Kevin Marks, for this link.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.320]   I just like the story.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:05.440]   The boring couple beats Google in court and is awarded a dollar.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.480]   This is a fun story.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   Dollar.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.920]   So you know about this, Jeff, right?
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.280]   This is a couple that sued Google because a street view
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.640]   car drove down their private road and took
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.840]   a picture of their house.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.800]   They weren't even German.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:23.240]   Most of the charges were included negligence
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.200]   were thrown out last year.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.680]   But boring versus Google continued in court
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.720]   on one last charge trespassing.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.280]   Now the case is over.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.920]   The judge ruled that Google was indeed guilty of count
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:49.880]   to trespass and awarded the boring couple $1 in penalties.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.320]   The boring is tried to appeal this to the Supreme Court.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.040]   The court turned down the appeal.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:00.960]   So Google spokesperson says, we are pleased this lawsuit
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.800]   is finally ended with the plaintiff's acknowledgment
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.520]   that they are entitled to only one fuck.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.280]   Now we know it.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.360]   That was a pretty good statement.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.160]   Now we know what a Google Street View
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.200]   picture of your house is worth.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.640]   I just love that story.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.720]   So I don't live in San Francisco, but I saw a Google Street View
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.120]   car here in San Diego.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.880]   And I was so excited about it.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.400]   Did you moon him?
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:22.920]   I did.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.120]   I did.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.760]   And it was parked.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.640]   And the camera was kind of covered.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.680]   And I felt like a little bit of a stalker walking up to it
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.280]   and checking it out.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.880]   But they're pretty clearly-- this one I saw anyway
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.880]   was really colorful and had the Google logo on it.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.440]   It was very clear what it was.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.680]   That was at my mind.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.320]   This is what we want to lobby for, Matt.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.720]   If you want to carry this back to the main office,
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.120]   we want them to release the schedule for the Street View
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.200]   car like the day before so that we can line up and perform.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.240]   Performance art.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.560]   As the car goes by.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.080]   I think I'll pass the suggestion on, certainly.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.240]   Just imagine how much more interesting Street View
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.040]   would be if people knew ahead of time.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.400]   And if somebody's shy, they can hide.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.000]   Right.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.360]   Less lawsuits about privacy.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:07.720]   Right.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.200]   Exactly.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.760]   Just tell us you're coming.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.000]   Like we told you.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.640]   You know, by the way, everybody's
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.360]   going to be mooning it and dancing.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.440]   And there'll be all sorts of great performance art going on
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.240]   out there.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.640]   Somebody told me that New York City,
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.480]   there is a tour that does this where
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.360]   that you drive around in these stadium seat buses facing
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   the side.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.280]   And they have performers, like improv performers,
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.200]   waiting for the bus to arrive.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.640]   They do a little show.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.240]   And then it goes on.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.520]   And they have speakers on the bus that encourage bystanders
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.720]   to participate in the performance art
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.160]   as the bus is driving around.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.120]   Have you heard that?
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:42.760]   Do you hear that stuff?
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.320]   I've never heard of it, but I'd love to do it.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.560]   I think, myth.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.920]   No, my sister told me about it.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.360]   She wouldn't lie.
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.440]   Do you think there was a miss?
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.400]   Have you ever won the Petaluma route?
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.000]   Because I'll slide the Petaluma.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.520]   Well, Twiggle put on some performance art for the feet.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.080]   That's happened.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.760]   Remember they had a marching band in the Street View
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.000]   car went through the marching band?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.840]   So Google must do that sometimes.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.920]   I think there's at least one picture in front of the Google
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.160]   Plex where they said, show up on this date.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.120]   And like one guy held up his will you marry me sign?
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.920]   And all that sort of stuff.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.760]   It would be so fun.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.080]   They probably broke it up and that's there forever.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.720]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   Womp, womp.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.640]   No, don't say that.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.720]   That's so unromantic, Jeff.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.640]   I'm a New Yorker.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   You sound like an old married man, New Yorker.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.200]   Well, and well, then I am in Germany now.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.840]   The next fight is, neighbors have found
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.200]   that their homes got pixelated when they didn't want it.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.000]   Oh, no.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.240]   You blossed me.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:36.920]   You blossed me.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.720]   For now, there are fights about that.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.040]   They want to be un-pixellined.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.400]   How dare you blur my windows?
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.600]   Not to blur me.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.880]   But the originals, the originals are blurred.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.360]   So there's no original to go back to.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.280]   Oh, wow.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.520]   I just imagine this army of Google interns,
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.360]   like these earnest young people who are dying to like climb
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.400]   the ranks within Google having to like call,
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.800]   you know, like color in these houses
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.720]   and then un-color them.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.400]   I know.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.480]   Like color them.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.800]   I got a number of emails from Germans, Jeff, who said,
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.880]   please do not call us German Blurmany.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.320]   We do not like that.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.080]   Oh.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.640]   But this is so good.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.080]   Maybe--
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:16.920]   It should be a lot.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.160]   All right, let's talk a little bit about net neutrality.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   This one is much more complicated than it seems
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:23.840]   on the face of it.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.720]   And there was a very good discussion yesterday
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.040]   on Tom Merritt's Tech News today from network provider
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.800]   about this Comcast versus level three thing.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.760]   And I mean, I'm so anxious and so glad and happy
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.360]   to berate Comcast for any reason at all.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.000]   And certainly, there is some fault there.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.840]   But apparently--
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.520]   There's a no follow here.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.680]   I think you the no follow.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.520]   Round equals no follow.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.200]   We need an audio no follow.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.080]   Your audio no follow.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.760]   But just use a different voice.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.840]   When you talk like this, you don't want to follow it.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   When you talk like this--
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.920]   It's not a recommendation.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.920]   Oh, my.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.080]   Matt, can you work on that too?
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.880]   As long as we got a shopping list for you, Matt.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.960]   And another thing.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.280]   Voice recognition.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.680]   Apparently, level three, which got the net--
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.600]   Let me give you this story from the beginning.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.680]   Level three carries Netflix streaming.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.240]   They did a deal again.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.640]   They got it away from Akamai, who
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.080]   used to do the Netflix streaming.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.400]   That's a lot of bandwidth.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.640]   We know now it's a huge percentage of prime time bandwidth.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.760]   And Comcast has said, dudes, you're
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.400]   free riding on our network.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.600]   And we want to charge you level three.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.280]   Level three wrote a blog post saying, you're
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.440]   right, this is not neutrality.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.040]   You're a tall road on the internet.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:48.880]   But they gave in.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.920]   They said, what are we going to do?
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.080]   We don't want Netflix to be mad at us.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.600]   Of course, the real problem in my mind
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.720]   is if there were any competition in the internet service
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.600]   world, if there were a choice for most people besides Comcast,
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.720]   if I were level three, I'd say, OK, fine Comcast.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.640]   Go ahead, Block.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.800]   Go ahead, see how your customers feel about that.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.760]   But there isn't.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.680]   And so a lot of customers, just as the same thing
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.560]   happen with cable vision and television, are stuck.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:20.240]   Well, now Comcast has more complicated than that.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.720]   In fact, level three kind of played some games
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.680]   so that instead of spreading the traffic to--
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.320]   Akamai used to bring it right to our various headends.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.480]   Level three's coming in at one headend
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.560]   and burdening our network, getting it from that head
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.640]   into all the other headends.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.000]   That's not how it was supposed to be.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.760]   We are reasonably charging.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.280]   Does anybody want to weigh in on this one,
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.480]   or should we just say it's not?
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.440]   Well, let me ask you a question.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.760]   As a New Yorker, let me answer a question with the question.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.680]   Yes.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.880]   In the discussion about the FCC, which
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.080]   we'll get to in a second too, I know, I saw one reference
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.160]   to saying that, well, you should pay more for more bits.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.320]   But that's not the issue here.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:00.800]   It's not.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.480]   It's just a matter of how many bits.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.400]   It's a matter of the quality of the delivery.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.560]   Well, let me put it this way.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.760]   I pay Comcast for internet access,
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.600]   and that includes the whole freaking internet.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.240]   That includes Netflix.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.320]   Does it seem fair that Comcast could then
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:20.040]   go to Google or Netflix or anybody else and say, yeah,
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.520]   if you want our customers, you're
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.000]   going to have to pay some extra money here.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.360]   That does seem like-- that's what net neutrality is all about--
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.600]   is that you shouldn't be able to have a toll road.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:28.840]   Right.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.480]   What I'm asking Leo is that there's
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.960]   two different things here, I think.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.520]   Basically, quantity and the other one is speed.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.120]   No?
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.000]   No, it's purely quantity.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.760]   It is purely quantity.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.600]   It's purely quantity.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.560]   It's the issue according to--
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.080]   As I understand it, the issue is according to Comcast.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.280]   The way Akamai did it, they would deliver those bits
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.160]   right to the headends of Comcast.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.960]   So it didn't burden the Comcast network the way Level 3
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.360]   is doing it.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.360]   And they're saying they're kind of a handoff at one point
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.000]   saying, you get it to your customers.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.880]   I think this is very complicated.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.200]   I think there is more to it than meets the eye.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.840]   As I said, I'm very happy to blame Comcast.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.280]   But maybe there is more.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.560]   And apparently, I'm told that if you really
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.800]   want to know more about this, you read the Nanog mailing list,
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.080]   the North America Network Operators group.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.240]   That sounds like a good read.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.920]   It's a long time, must read list.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.160]   That sounds like a beach read.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.100]   Sorry.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.000]   I didn't mean to--
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.520]   Actually, it probably is a really good read
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.360]   because these guys are fascinating, really smart.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.280]   And I know some Nanog members.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:34.880]   But I don't know.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.720]   You're right.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.960]   I confess I haven't had the fortitude to sit down
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.560]   and read the mailing list.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.440]   But there's more than meets the eye here.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.080]   And some say, really Level 3 is pulling some shenanigans.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.320]   I don't know what the-- who's at fault here.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.720]   I guess the best I could say is this does raise the issue
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.760]   of network neutrality.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.160]   And this really is the first time we've
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.080]   heard of a company, a big internet service provider.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.040]   And Comcast is the biggest saying, I mean,
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.600]   what if they went to Google and said, hey,
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.480]   you want our customers to make Google searches?
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.360]   You're going to have to pay for that.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:06.920]   The issue.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.560]   Access.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.320]   They're likely to be YouTube, right?
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.920]   That absolutely isn't it?
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.120]   Well, I go back to when excited home came out--
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.360]   I think we talked about this once on the show 20 or 30
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.400]   shows ago-- when excited at home came out,
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.000]   they were saying, will--
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.480]   this was the original net neutrality problem.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.760]   They said, if you dead end right into us,
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.400]   we'll allow you to do that and we'll charge you
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.000]   for the privilege.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.880]   It was the exact opposite of this case.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.200]   It was saying that if you want--
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.360]   it would be like saying to Akamai,
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.200]   we'll charge you for the privilege
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.040]   of making a direct connection into our head ends.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.000]   And as a result, your stuff will be delivered at quality.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.320]   And so Akamai, in a sense to Comcast,
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.720]   did them the favor.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:54.280]   It would appear of creating these direct connections.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.320]   And then when Level 3 doesn't and acts like just
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.120]   any other network customer, it's kind of like Akamai
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.040]   made them look bad.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.040]   But why should Level 3's bits be discriminated against
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.080]   versus my bits?
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:13.240]   Maybe this is just too complicated for us to discuss.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.880]   But I think it's a big issue.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.760]   It is.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.160]   I think a lot of this would go away.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.400]   I don't think you'd need a net neutrality regulation
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.480]   if there were true competition among internet service
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:24.880]   providers.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.320]   But very few of us have more than one or two choices.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.400]   And if both of them are being rapacious,
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.720]   we don't have much choice.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.640]   So the Federal Communications Commission
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.840]   is set to vote on net neutrality rules this month,
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.880]   December.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.840]   On Wednesday, the FCC staff circulated an agenda
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.800]   for December 21, saying that they would vote on that day
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.520]   on an order that adopts, quote, "basic rules of the road
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:55.560]   to preserve the open internet as a platform for innovation,
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.400]   investment, competition, and free expression."
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.840]   That sounds optimistic.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.400]   I like the phrase.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.040]   Yeah, me too.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.600]   And it's on solstice.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.080]   Let's hope the hippies rule.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.440]   There are, according to this article on CNET,
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   two major areas of contention.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.800]   Broadband providers want to ensure the language use
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.480]   and the rules would not prohibit them from managing
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.840]   their networks.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.560]   That's code for things like what Comcast did with BitTorrent,
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.120]   using Sandvine to make sure that not too many bits from BitTorrent
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.320]   were spread over the network.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.720]   But it does seem reasonable that they
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.960]   have to manage their networks.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.320]   And we were demanding more and more bandwidth
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.680]   over their pipes.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.680]   Or they would like to make sure that they continue
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.360]   to have the right to charge different prices
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.040]   for different levels of service.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.520]   And I'm with you on this, Jeff.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.920]   If you're saying I want more bandwidth, more speed,
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.800]   you should be able to--
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.280]   I mean, they should be able to say, well,
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.040]   for the highest bandwidth, you pay the highest price.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.600]   I don't think anybody has a problem with that, right?
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.560]   As long as at every tier, all the bits are treated equally.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.280]   Exactly.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.760]   That Bing doesn't somehow get a better deal than Google
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.000]   or vice versa.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.400]   Right.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.560]   Paying less for dial-up and paying more for broadband.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.200]   That's cool.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.520]   That's always been that way.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.600]   Yeah, yes.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.360]   Secondly, the second bonus contention
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.840]   is from wireless service providers.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.560]   And this is that famous Google Verizon
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.120]   Pact who want wireless networks to be
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.480]   exempt from any net neutrality regulations.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.440]   And of course, Google and Verizon issued a joint statement
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.960]   saying that Google said, yes, that's a good idea.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.680]   That land networks are one thing,
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   but these wireless networks are another,
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.280]   and they should be exempt.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.560]   Oh.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.080]   Well, maybe if you put a term on it,
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:47.720]   I could see exempt for the next year or two years,
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.800]   I could see, because they're nascent.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.280]   And they say to my father, the idea
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.600]   that wired and wireless are at all different is endoluvian.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.640]   It's ridiculous.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.920]   Now, the only thing that might happen--
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.640]   you see, here's the problem.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.360]   The competition we are going to get to the wired door--
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.840]   It's going to be wireless.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.120]   Wireless is through things like white spaces
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.680]   that Google has fought for.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.400]   And now, if all of that future competition--
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.080]   you just said, the solution is competition.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.120]   Ah, but the competition is regulated.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:22.520]   Right.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.640]   There's no competition because the FCC
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.800]   did set it up that way.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.300]   Right.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.300]   That's what's so scary about this.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.600]   The only way to get competition is through wireless.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.040]   And you're making wireless hampered against wired,
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.280]   then we might as well not have the competition.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.040]   That F--
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.640]   Well, and it seems like one thing that everybody could agree on
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.720]   is if there were more wireless spectrum,
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.800]   that would be really nice.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.960]   So the FCC is doing a lot of stuff about white spaces.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.520]   And some of these things that used
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.920]   to be taken up with analog television channels,
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.520]   they don't need that much room when they switch to digital.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.000]   And wow, there's so much interesting stuff going on
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.360]   with wireless and phones.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.160]   And the more you can have that ability to try new things,
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.800]   I think the better everybody will be off.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.300]   Hi.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:09.320]   Julius Janikowski, the chairman of the FCC,
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:14.520]   did discuss a compromise, which I might be able to get behind,
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:20.120]   similar to what Henry Waxman proposed earlier this year,
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   which would bar internet service providers
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.360]   from discriminating against rival internet traffic.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:32.200]   I don't know how key rival is, and includes some limited net
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.400]   neutrality protections on wireless.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.520]   Maybe that's a good compromise.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:42.120]   Maybe not completely free rein in wireless, but some.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.720]   Here's where I'm starting to go.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.560]   And this is very much unlike me because I'm not
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.120]   anti-government, but I'm not libertarian, I'm a Democrat.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.200]   But I sometimes sound like it.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.600]   But in this case, I'm starting to wonder
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.040]   whether the internet is such a utility and so important
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:02.480]   strategically that to follow the analogy of the interstate,
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.440]   the government will pay private people to build it
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.800]   because we paid to build it, it's open, and it's ours.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.120]   I kind of-- it's so funny because that's exactly what I thought.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   It's like the interstate highway system.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.440]   It shouldn't be owned by anyone.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.200]   It's a national resource.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.480]   And there's all sorts of economic considerations.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:27.080]   It's in the national interest that it be open, free, affordable.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.480]   We pay way more for bandwidth.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:35.400]   22nd or 23rd in availability and cost of bandwidth in the world.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.080]   So all this huha about supporting their investment in our bandwidth,
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.480]   well, they're not investing.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.800]   Look at trying to use your AT&T.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.120]   No.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.320]   Look at what they're trying to go on.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.600]   Essentially, what they're trying to do
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:49.480]   is to maximize the profit from the copper that they put in
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.800]   because they want to get all the money out of that
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.680]   before they upgrade to fiber or whatever is next.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.360]   Back in the day when I knew this stuff,
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.800]   I knew that cable companies--
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.400]   it's been quite a while, it's been a few years.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.160]   But when I was involved in this, cable companies
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:07.160]   were getting gross margin of 45% on their delivery of bandwidth.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.160]   We all find--
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.120]   I'll just put a standing offer in.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.280]   I will buy fiber from anyone who will send it to me.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.520]   You mean to?
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.560]   I can't get it.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.400]   You can't get it.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.480]   I'm pretty frustrated.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.680]   You know, Verizon stopped.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.200]   I mean, I think Fios is done right now.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.080]   They've gone everywhere.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.840]   They're going to go.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.400]   Now, LTE goes live, and I'm going to talk about that
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.040]   in just a second.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:26.720]   So don't go anywhere.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.640]   This is wireless, and you're right, Jeff.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.120]   This may be the future for high-speed internet.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.360]   Before we talk about that, I want
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.520]   to talk about getting rid of those old gadgets with Gazelle.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.880]   Don't sell it.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.920]   Gazelle it.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.160]   Gazelle is a really fun, good service.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.760]   And every time I talk about it, I get tweets and emails
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.000]   from people who've tried it, were maybe perhaps a little
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.200]   skeptical.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.840]   I was, the first time I heard about Gazelle.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.600]   I said, well, let me get a box together and see.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.600]   Here's what happens.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.360]   You go to Gazelle.com, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.560]   There's a form there that you fill in and say,
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.160]   this is what I've got.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.240]   These are my gadgets.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:08.560]   And they'll tell you, you tell them what quality it is,
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.920]   whether you got the cords, the cables, and all of that stuff.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.680]   And then they tell you what they'll pay you for it.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.640]   Then you get a box.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.560]   You put it on a box.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.560]   They send you the mailing label, so you don't pay for the shipping.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.320]   And all of a sudden, lo and behold, you get a check about a week
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:25.600]   later.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.120]   Or you can get a-- I think they have PayPal cards, Amazon cards.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.040]   You have a variety of stuff.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:30.920]   Oh, look.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.160]   Redesigned page.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.360]   That's the old one?
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.920]   This is the new one.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.640]   Oh, neat.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.320]   Cash for your gadgets.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.320]   Here's all the categories.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.400]   Blu-ray players, calculators.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.520]   How many calculators do you have lying around the house?
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.680]   Camcorders, camera lenses, cell phones?
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.480]   Oh, boy.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.040]   Oh, baby.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.440]   I got a drawer full.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.640]   Desktop's digital cameras, e-readers, PDAs, hard drives, GPS
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:58.960]   devices, gaming consoles, home audio.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.080]   You're filling the form.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:01.600]   Let's see.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.040]   I see.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.200]   I'm going to try a Bose.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:04.800]   Let's see.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.600]   Bose wave radio.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.120]   Time to get rid of that.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.600]   You tell it the condition.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.480]   No, it works.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.320]   No noticeable flaws.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.440]   Perfect.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.440]   You just fill out this form, see?
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.120]   I've got all the original stuff.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.360]   Yeah, sure, sure.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.120]   The original box, no, I don't have that.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:21.520]   Come on.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.160]   Let's get real through that out.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.600]   And they say, it's worth 88 bucks.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.040]   So you add that to the box.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.040]   And you can sell them.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.880]   But send a box full of crap.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.160]   And then they will send you a check.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.760]   In fact, I'm going to give you a little hint here.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:41.280]   If you use the offer code Twig, they'll
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.160]   give you a 5% bonus on checkouts.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.240]   They'll give you a little extra just to let us give us
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.520]   a little bang for our buck.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.200]   They also do recycling if there's no value to your gadget.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.720]   And God knows I have a few.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:55.520]   They will absolutely recycle it in a environmentally friendly
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.600]   way, green recycling.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.200]   They have charity pages too.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.200]   Forget having a bake sale.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.080]   Have a gadget sale.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:12.720]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.360]   Don't sell it.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.680]   Gazelle it.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   Use the offer code Twig for an additional 5%.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.200]   This week in Google, here comes LTE.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   Verizon at a press conference today.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.640]   LTE, which stands for long term evolution.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.800]   Boy, is there a terrible acronym.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.280]   What the hell?
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.600]   Is it 4G?
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.240]   It's 4G.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   Yeah, it's 4G.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:38.760]   It's 4G.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.520]   Well, you know what?
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.280]   It's interesting because the definition of 4G,
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.720]   technically, is actually much higher speed than anybody in the US
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.560]   is offering, technically.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.200]   That figures.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.440]   But we call it 4G because it's faster than 3G.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.800]   It's like 3.9G.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.000]   3.9G.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.320]   So LTE, which, I mean, in theory, I think what they're saying,
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:00.800]   I can't remember.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.480]   I looked it up once.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.160]   What 4G is-- if you look on Wikipedia,
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:06.240]   I think they're saying like 10 megabits is nowhere near that.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.200]   So when that actually happens, it'll be like, no, this is the real 4G.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.120]   That was just--
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:10.880]   That was really--
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.480]   What would they call it?
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.480]   They'll call it fourth dimension.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.560]   It would be 4G S.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.560]   4G S. Superior 4G.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:22.760]   LTE will be available in 38 markets, 60 airports on December 5.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   That's Saturday.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.040]   Four days from now.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:27.800]   Yay.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.320]   Woo-hoo.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.480]   Matt's happy.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.200]   They're going to offer two different USB modems from Verizon.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.160]   I don't know what the costs are going to be.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:37.760]   My 5?
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.960]   Have you had my 5?
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:43.560]   Presumably, it will be available in the Bay Area.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.840]   I'm sure Manhattan's on list.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.320]   Let me look.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.320]   38 cities.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.440]   God, I don't have to be in a second tier city.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.880]   Is San Diego second tier?
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.920]   I'm going back to New York.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.120]   Let me go to the--
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.320]   Yay, Gina, yay.
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   Come back.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:01.480]   You know, they got this bus that drives around.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.240]   There is a Verizon LTE site.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.280]   I'm just trying to find it.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.280]   The LTE--
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.920]   The bzw.com/lte/overview.com.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.160]   HTML.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.400]   Here it is, the LTE Information Center.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.440]   But where is the list of cities?
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.600]   Doesn't have--
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.760]   Where is the list of cities?
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.000]   You can follow it on Twitter.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:25.480]   You can listen to it.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.520]   I don't want to follow you on Twitter.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.800]   I want the list.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.440]   Get more information here.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.000]   Cities.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.360]   I saw that they do have San Francisco and San Jose.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.600]   And that's as much as I read.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.400]   That's all-- you stopped there, didn't you?
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.880]   You stopped right there.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:46.480]   Look, here's a button that says test men and women.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   I wonder what that is.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.080]   What is that?
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:48.720]   I don't know, but--
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.400]   I'm glad they have a button that says that.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.240]   I will continue to research.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:57.600]   All right.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:01.520]   We're going to let Gina find out where LTE is.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.800]   But that's-- you know what happened,
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.880]   is that Sprint was taking all the air out of the room
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.840]   with their fake L4G, which is really Y-Max.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.480]   And Verizon said, we can't let them--
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.320]   those sons of guns, we can't let them continue to own the 4G.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.080]   In fact, Sprint and Verizon were fighting over whether it
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.520]   is even 4G.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:25.440]   So they're going to have them-- let me see if--
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:32.560]   and Gadget has a review of the LG VL600 modem.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.600]   And the company says announcement.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.560]   [SINGING]
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.240]   It's rather large.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.640]   It sure is.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.520]   It's huge.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.760]   It's a USB dongle.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.600]   Comes with an extra--
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.880]   See, that's what gets me mad.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.840]   The only thing I want is my file.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.960]   Dongle's ridiculous.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.200]   There's no reason to have a dongle.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.760]   So now, remember that there is no one using 4G or the LTE
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.200]   4G right now.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.080]   But in Gadget testing it said they
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.640]   got consistent speeds of 7 megabits down, 1 megabit up.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.000]   That's better than a lot of people's home service.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.400]   Overall, speeds held steady.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.920]   You remember, nobody's using it except you--
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   No, excuse me.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.480]   At 5 to 6 megabits down, 1 to megabit up.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.240]   That's faster than Y-Max.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.880]   I have to say, I was very unimpressed,
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.520]   underwhelmed with Y-Max in Las Vegas when we used it.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.120]   That's clear.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.760]   Is that clear?
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.800]   That's clear, yep.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.880]   I got to test one from them, which I'm about to send back.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:31.040]   And it got me good bandwidth here, like 7, 8.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.360]   But then people said, wait, there's
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.560]   any more hurt words being used.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:34.360]   You don't get much.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.720]   That's the problem is that it's shared bandwidth.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.240]   The other problem is it had software on the machine.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.480]   And it demanded to upgrade the thing when I wasn't online.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:45.520]   And all this big deal, my file is just the only way to go.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.760]   Yeah, I agree with it.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.960]   And that's why the way why I got--
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.040]   What'd you get?
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.680]   I got it when I got it when I said it.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.120]   Oh, you got it.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:00.040]   Samsung, he's playing Angry Birds on the Samsung Galaxy tab.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:00.640]   So well--
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.080]   And they need to read the tab.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.120]   The beauty of the thing about it is it, in fact, is--
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.680]   You got a big-- he has big hips.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.120]   So it goes right in his hip pockets.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:09.840]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.120]   They got smaller hips that you--
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:15.320]   You know, it makes me wish I wore blazers still.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.080]   That's all that's-- they've become
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.400]   like my photographers jacket.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.640]   Yeah, I think more and more people
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.080]   are going to pick up blazers so they can carry around
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.720]   their big ass gadgets.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:25.600]   Yes, seriously.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.600]   I got to carry a freaking purse.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.000]   It's the one of the purse.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.440]   That's the worst.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.080]   Purse.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:32.880]   I don't want to purse.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.400]   So how do you like it, Jeff?
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.160]   I like it.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.680]   I mean, it has a lot of the same problems
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.960]   that the iPad has to me.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.840]   So I'm not-- for all those people's hands--
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.680]   Great screen, though.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:42.360]   Great screen.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.120]   It's got a good screen.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.760]   It doesn't have the USB I want.
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.160]   It's not a phone, which is stupid.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.080]   That bugs me, too.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.720]   It's like, if I'm going to carry that around,
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.520]   I want it at least to be a phone.
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.120]   Of course, it is ridiculous.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:54.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.560]   Well, I don't know.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.360]   That looks kind of good.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:02.200]   I got a big head, too, by the way.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.000]   But the fact that it fits in the pocket is great.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.680]   I had a senior moment at my office yesterday.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.480]   I'm looking all around.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.720]   Oh my god, I've lost it already.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.560]   I've got all the best.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.800]   Was it my pocket?
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.080]   At least it wasn't on your head.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:16.880]   No, I'm very impressed by it.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.640]   I like it a lot.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.000]   The reason I got it was it also has the access point.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.720]   You did not get-- oh, it has a--
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.640]   yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.920]   I just-- I went and bought it with no plan.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.480]   It was a mistake.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.440]   I can't get geography.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.240]   I can't get everything else.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:30.840]   No, you need to plan.
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:31.960]   I bought a separate MIFI.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:32.720]   So screw it.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:33.320]   I went back.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.400]   And I got the plan.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.640]   Yeah, I have to say, I love that Android can still
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.960]   do the Wi-Fi hotspot and the USB tethering,
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:45.520]   because I went to Tennessee to see my grandfather last week.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.200]   He turned 99 right before Thanksgiving.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.440]   And there's no Wi-Fi to be had in his house.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.680]   So I fired up my Android device,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.360]   and I had a little USB straw that I could sort of get the net
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.120]   through, and so I could keep track of stuff.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.520]   Pretty darn sweet.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.640]   So did you get the Verizon, Jeff?
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.800]   No, I got the Sprint.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.240]   T-Mobile, OK.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:07.640]   And you--
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.200]   Because it do the tethering.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.120]   Right.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.440]   I think the-- I think the Sprint does tethering, too.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:13.920]   Pretty sure.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.600]   Cost more.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.920]   Oh, but you paid $20 a month.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:16.320]   That's right.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.680]   Yeah, this is included.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.000]   So--
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.400]   All right, so we got one more story,
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.200]   and I'm going to put Matt in the spot.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.840]   Groupon.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.320]   Groupon.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.160]   I know nothing.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.320]   I know nothing.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.560]   Groupon.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.440]   The rumor is-- and this is now all things--
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.120]   detocking.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.400]   This is the Wall Street Journal, New York Times,
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.640]   all saying Google and Hot and Heavy conversations
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.720]   with Groupon, which is the Group Buying site,
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:48.160]   to buy it for an unbelievable $5.3 to $6 billion.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.920]   [YELLING]
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.440]   And the obvious joke--
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.440]   What?
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   That I know we've seen back in the bottom of the head.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:59.000]   --of my Groupon clones.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.680]   All right, Gina, do you use Groupon?
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.760]   Are you a Groupon Group Buying?
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.440]   I know.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.840]   I've seen ads for it.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.640]   I see it ads for it a lot, but I know I haven't used it,
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:09.040]   but some folks are really into it.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.360]   And I mean, it kind of makes sense, right?
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.000]   Facebook deals.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.200]   You know, it's similar to that, right, from what I understand.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.000]   Well, what's interesting is it's very much like the Beacon
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.760]   thing, because if you link it to Facebook,
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:23.160]   it does all this stuff Beacon wanted to do.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.360]   But Facebook got in trouble with, you know, your friend.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   I'll just let you buy.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:31.320]   Gina just got an amazing deal on the 18-hole golf game.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.840]   That's what they're offering me right now.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.720]   $27 for 18 holes of golf, including cart rental supply
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:40.320]   of warm-up range balls and take home souvenir
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.360]   at the fabulous Heeelsburg Golf Club at Taimen Park,
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.560]   of $57 value.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.400]   So every day you get one of these.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.400]   Yeah, you get one.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.520]   And for me, they're all crap.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.360]   I don't want any--
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.440]   I agree with you.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.640]   But 57 people in my area bought this.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.320]   Well, but it's only 57 people.
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.440]   Matt, Matt, I know we've given you other tasks today.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.360]   Can I give you one more here, even if you know nothing
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.280]   about this?
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.000]   It's like the only two minutes to live this.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.600]   And say, don't do it.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.040]   Stop, stop.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.680]   I know a small little podcast network you could buy for $1
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.520]   billion.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.480]   Cheat this.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.680]   I hear they have really good production values, too.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.320]   Fantastic.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.560]   Fantastic hosts.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.960]   They have good conversation.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.280]   They have a revenue model.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.000]   Actually, Groupon's doing all right.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.280]   According to Wall Street, 500 million a year in revenue.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.080]   So, Jeff, come on.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:31.800]   This is a good buy.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.120]   And growing fast.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.280]   In fact, here's--
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.480]   Hey, I'll give you--
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.640]   OK, I won't say-- I won't say anymore.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.960]   Google's Myspace.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.160]   This will be Google's Myspace.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:43.600]   That's pretty good.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.360]   Because the problem I think is that--
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.240]   it's a fad right now.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.040]   And Google looks at it and says, we don't do that.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.160]   It has 3,000--
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.480]   one of Fred Wilson's partners that
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.640]   are very good post about this.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.160]   Google is a technology company that
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.480]   has huge sales per person.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.920]   Groupon is a person company.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.200]   It's a sales company.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.920]   They have 3,000 salespeople owning the sales force
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.520]   at hyperlocal will not scale.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.280]   I repeat, it will not scale.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.640]   The problem to solve here is how you scale selling
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.120]   to millions of businesses.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.400]   Now, Google has done that to an extent.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.320]   And to me, Facebook just won this by making the deals free
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.880]   and then making everybody an upsell customer.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.080]   And so they identify who's the best prospect
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.200]   and they can sell in new ways.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.360]   And so I think Facebook's way ahead on this model.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.080]   They can put Groupon in functionality and in a flash.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.880]   There's no barrier to entry here.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.080]   It's a very low revenue per employee company.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.680]   Yeah, fine.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.880]   So it gets through sheer force of will.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.840]   It gets $50 million a month.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:50.560]   That's fine.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.560]   That's a nice company.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.960]   But it ain't worth $5 billion.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.480]   Matt, please tell them my stock money no.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.560]   I will pass the remarks on.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.240]   Matt's going to run in.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.880]   Matt's going to run in and say, guys, stop!
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.800]   I've got some new information.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.640]   I need one of those about the eyeglass place.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.280]   So we've got to--
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.720]   Don't you think, Jeff, that perhaps somebody's thought
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.400]   about this?
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.160]   Rupert, Rupert, you got to buy this thing.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:22.560]   We saw it.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.120]   All the kids are using it.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.160]   It's called your space or my space or something like that.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.880]   OK, I will, right?
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.320]   Look at this.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:35.080]   Total-- total dollars saved by Groupon users, $789 million.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.720]   Total Groupon's bought $18.3 million.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720]   I don't want to do your number.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.240]   Does your number of the week have anything to do with Groupon?
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:43.960]   Well, then I'll give you--
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.920]   I'll give you a number.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.320]   It's two years old.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.160]   The company's two years old.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.640]   If they do, in fact, sell for $6 billion,
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.920]   they will have increased their value $20 million a day
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.720]   since the day they were founded.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.720]   Observe.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.560]   It's a friggin' bubble.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.920]   I was thinking of starting a similar business.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.040]   But literally.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.680]   All right, so my Groupon-- I've
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.200]   subscribed to Groupon in North Jersey.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.680]   My-- I can save up to $84% off--
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.280]   Laser Hero-- a hair removal in Pearl River.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.880]   I don't even know where Pearl River is.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.640]   No, I agree.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.000]   I'm in the Napa Sonoma area.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.520]   And it is.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.600]   And you only get one of these a day.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.200]   So this is it.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.520]   I get a half off a Manny Petty in Hoboken.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.720]   I got that yesterday.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.360]   I got that yesterday.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.400]   But it wasn't in Hoboken.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.320]   But I got the same thing.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:31.880]   Half off.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.720]   I get 52% off ice skating.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.520]   High ice skating.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.000]   I fall in my ass and break it.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.200]   It's crap.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.440]   They're selling a bunch of crap.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.040]   I get 55% off.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.360]   It was a reduction in New Jersey monthly.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.360]   Absolutely.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.280]   He's a junk--
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.960]   It is a little down market, I got to say.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.440]   So I have to admit, I haven't used Groupon myself.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.520]   But maybe there's some benefit to the fact
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.280]   that people could expose to things
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.200]   they wouldn't normally get exposed to.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.560]   I don't know about you, but I don't know.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.120]   But I don't know.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.960]   Hit the same six or seven restaurants.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.960]   And so maybe if it gets you exposed to a new restaurant
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.640]   or a new experience or a new business,
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:11.200]   that could be what a lot of people enjoy about it.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.880]   Hey, give that a bonus for trying to carry the water there.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.080]   We have--
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.560]   Very nicely done that.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.040]   Nice.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.680]   It was very, very calm and easy in them.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.920]   Rational, but--
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.400]   No.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:22.900]   No.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.280]   I'll pass on your--
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.200]   It's not going to give it to them.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:26.560]   No.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.120]   What about the-- it's Angry Birds Day, December 11.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.600]   You going to celebrate Angry Birds Day?
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.800]   I came so close to buying one of the little Angry Birds
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.440]   plush toys that I knew that I have a problem.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.240]   Because I stuffed animals.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.080]   It's been a lot few years.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.160]   Angry Bird plush toys.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.240]   I'm like, I need that stuffed red bird.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.400]   I need it.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.960]   And I want to throw it at people in my life.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.000]   How about the guy who Googles himself and finds out
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.520]   he's a murder suspect.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.520]   But of a standout student here at the University of Florida,
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.080]   I'm in this reaction was Pier Shock.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.720]   And after that, it was just me being upset.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.480]   Zachary Garcia is a freshman from Hollywood, Florida
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.040]   who stumbled upon the mistake late Saturday night.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.280]   He was googling his name when he came across the news stories.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.360]   He called home, woke up his mother,
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.680]   and said he feared getting kicked out of school,
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.040]   losing his two jobs, or worse.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.600]   By the way, case of mistaken identity, it wasn't him.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.800]   So you know, he feels much better.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.080]   But this is-- the funniest quote I'd ever seen
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.640]   where he basically said, I make sub sandwiches for people.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.400]   The worst I could ever do is make a bad sub.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.600]   I've never murdered anybody.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.080]   And right is for men.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.560]   Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.400]   OK, I'll leave that alone.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.120]   I got to remember to scroll down to the bottom here.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.240]   I thought that was down there.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.200]   Garnet, I should have seen.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.840]   Now it's my fault that I didn't mark it above.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.240]   That's OK.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.360]   I'll save that for you.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.360]   The iPhone is from Mars.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.600]   No, the iPhone's from Xenith.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.400]   Venus, not Xenith.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.400]   You steal my punchline, too.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.400]   It's obvious.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.200]   I didn't steal this.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.200]   It's obvious.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:11.880]   I know it is.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.880]   It's all I do is obvious.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.320]   I'm obvious.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.920]   Android, I mean, we'll get-- they'll be the first--
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.160]   this is actually very telling.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.920]   Angry Birds, which really was an iPhone app
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.760]   than an iPad app, finally came to Android.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.400]   It's not on Windows Fun 7.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:29.040]   Now, Rovio announces that the Angry Birds expansion
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.360]   pack for the season will be Android only.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.360]   [CHUCKLES]
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.920]   Angry Birds, you love it.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.160]   But you don't try to play it on the iPhone.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.520]   I think it's a conspiracy against Google
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.960]   because it's going to make every Android user just
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.360]   waste parts of the economy.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.840]   I have the Halloween one.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.080]   I want to play the--
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.280]   So are they-- they are charging for seasons, though?
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.000]   The season's not on.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.840]   It's not just ad support.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.960]   Well, that's a good question because the Angry Birds
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.080]   on Android is ad support, which is an interesting experiment.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.280]   What do we say last week?
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.360]   Seven million downloads.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.240]   They've got to be making money on it.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:17.440]   So it's an advent calendar, really, for Android.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.160]   Because Android didn't get the Halloween edition.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.040]   So 25 levels for the 25 days of Christmas,
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.720]   of holiday snow fun.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.520]   It will also include the Halloween expansion.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.520]   And it's all free.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:37.720]   Huh.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.320]   And this isn't available for the iPhone?
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:48.120]   And by the way, Jeff, isn't the Samsung
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.960]   tab a great Angry Birds platform?
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:51.440]   It is.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:51.920]   It's wonderful.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.400]   Oh, you guys are killing me.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.760]   Oh, you guys are killing me.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.320]   What do we do on Angry Birds Day?
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.440]   I actually have to look here.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.360]   I haven't played Angry Birds in ages.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.200]   I don't even know.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.120]   Seriously, we need to call it one another with stuffed Angry
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:06.480]   Birds.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.640]   I think that's the most appropriate.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.240]   Look, Angry Birds meetups around the world.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.400]   Well, that's a funny one.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:16.600]   OK.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.600]   OK.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.840]   I'm going to take a break.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.080]   We're going to come back with our tip, our number,
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.360]   and our tool of the week.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.880]   What are you doing, Jeff?
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.440]   What is he?
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.960]   It's in Gita, jealous.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960]   Jealous.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.920]   Jealous Angry Birds.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   So long.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.480]   I'm waiting for a Google tablet.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.960]   Come on, the Killer Bird.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.240]   Yeah, what about Gingerbread?
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.560]   You got the statue, Matt.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.920]   What about Gingerbread?
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.400]   The great thing about working at Google
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.320]   is you're going to try out some stuff.
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.240]   So come work at Google and you can dog food
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.000]   wonderful new products.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.040]   Honeycomb.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.520]   What you mean that Matt is running Gingerbread?
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:53.040]   Damn it.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:53.560]   Gingerbread?
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.920]   He's probably running Honeycomb.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.000]   Honeycomb, maybe.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.360]   He's probably running Honeycomb on his tablet.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:03.160]   He's probably running Chrome OS on his netbook.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.760]   Now I keep hearing conflicting stuff.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.920]   Now they're saying, yes, it will be this year.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.520]   They better hurry.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.480]   They got a one-month left.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.320]   I wonder what the Google Christmas present to employees
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.640]   is going to be, perhaps, a netbook?
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.960]   Do you get a gift every year?
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.320]   Is that how that works?
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.640]   Historically, they have.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.200]   But I try not to get into the mode or the mindset where
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.480]   it's like Google owes me something.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.480]   If I don't enjoy it, that's a problem.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.800]   But I do enjoy it very much.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.360]   So that's why I keep coming to Google every day.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.880]   It's funny because my employees, they say, what are you giving us?
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.880]   So what are you giving us?
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.560]   How do you know?
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.120]   I'm a fan.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.440]   Oh, sorry.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.800]   Well, if you know, I guess everybody probably knows.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.800]   Apparently, they're going to update the Netflix app on the Google
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.320]   TV, which is good because it has kind of an old and funky--
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.440]   can I confession?
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.160]   Yesterday, I come home.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.600]   Henry says, I can't-- the TV's not working.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.920]   I said, yes, it is.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.840]   He said, no, it's black.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.800]   I said, oh, let me see.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.960]   The Google TV has--
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.440]   I talked about this a couple of weeks ago.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.200]   It pops up an error that says the time is wrong,
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.880]   then it turns on the screen saver.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.440]   And unless you know to hit the keyboard on the Google TV
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.960]   to wake it up, you don't see anything on your TV.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.080]   That's a bug that I can file, yeah, for sure.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.920]   Yeah, we should please.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.440]   Too late.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.040]   I've already-- I've removed it from the chain.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:27.880]   I actually said--
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.360]   Aw.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:28.880]   Aw.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.320]   I'm loaded.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.400]   It's very easy, though, because it's a pass through.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.360]   So I just--
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:34.880]   [POP]
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.160]   And I'm done.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.480]   Well, and it is-- it's definitely the analogy with the G1
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.000]   and how much--
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.960]   It's the G1.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.800]   It's the G1.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.160]   And you actually can see them iterating
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.520]   and how fast they're making changes to improve it.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.000]   Well, and this is one measure of it
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.920]   is that they're finally putting the--
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:58.920]   the full real Netflix on it, the one with it
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.360]   where you could pick from the--
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.560]   I said that old version.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.040]   So that's an improvement.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.120]   Aw, I can't wait.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.000]   I can't wait.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   And I am not going to throw out the Google TV.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.320]   I'm not going to return the Google TV.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.120]   I have hopes.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.640]   I have high hopes.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.560]   And I will-- I will just like my G1, which
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.480]   is in a drawer right here someday.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.760]   I will flash the firmware, and it will magically
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.080]   appear.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.840]   Before we go on with the show, I just
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.600]   want to mention quickly the General Electric Eco
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.240]   Imagination Challenge, which is rapidly coming to a close.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.080]   This is a great idea.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.240]   GE put together $200 million to invest in new ideas
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.680]   for improving the way energy is produced, transferred,
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.360]   and consumed.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.080]   If you go to ecoimagination.com/challenge,
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.520]   you can see the winners.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.560]   Three different categories.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.680]   The first is Renewables.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.120]   GE wants to encourage better ways
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.400]   to integrate renewable energy right into the power grid.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.480]   Energy from wind, water, sun.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:03.480]   The second investment category, Grid Efficiency,
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.280]   to convert the smart grid--
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.640]   the smart grid is even now out of date.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.440]   They're going for digital energy.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.560]   And finally, eco homes and buildings, which
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.760]   is fairly important if you think about it.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.280]   It's not merely better ways to generate,
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.040]   but also ways to conserve.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.480]   So $200 million.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.280]   And if you go to eco imagination,
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:35.560]   e-c-o-m-a-g-i-n-a-t-i-o-n slash.com/challenge--
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.360]   I'm going there right now--
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.040]   you'll see some of the winners in the eco imagination
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.240]   challenge, whoops, there it is.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.760]   And it's just really a great thing.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.840]   GE has supported our Green Tech Today show, which
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.200]   is still going on in a great show.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.840]   You can catch it on iTunes if you've missed earlier episodes
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.280]   or go to twit.tv/gtt.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.120]   And then go to eco imagination.com and meet the winners.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.160]   And their great ideas.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.760]   Thank you, GE, for putting together such a great program
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.120]   and putting together so much money, $200 million
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.760]   towards this good cause.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.840]   eco imagination.com/challenge-- we
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.760]   thank GE for their support of this show and Green Tech
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.280]   Today.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.880]   Time for Gina's Tip of the Week.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.880]   AirSync.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.320]   Oh, you're doing it.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:20.840]   I'm doing it.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:21.240]   I'm doing it.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:21.880]   AirSync.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.240]   So if you've got an Android phone
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.000]   and you use Double Twist, which is the three kind of iTunes
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.160]   for Android software, DoubleTwist.com,
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.440]   there's a brand new feature called AirSync, which will let
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.880]   you wirelessly sync your playlists, videos, and photos
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.120]   to your Android device over Wi-Fi.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:43.080]   So I'm trained now with Android.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.720]   I never have to connect my Android phone to my computer,
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.080]   all my contacts, all my mail, everything gets just
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.240]   there on the phone, which is the best part about Android.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.600]   The only time you really did have to connect the phones
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.240]   for computers to sync media.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.680]   And now with Double Twist with AirSync,
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.440]   you can do it wirelessly.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.600]   Is it over Wi-Fi?
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.200]   You have both have to be on the same network I would test.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.280]   Yeah, it's over Wi-Fi.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.920]   So you have to install the Double Twist software
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.640]   on your desktop, which I already had because I was using it.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:09.160]   Me too.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.640]   And then you have to get the update for the Double Twist
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.360]   app on your Android device.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.120]   And it just says, set up AirSync.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.800]   If the two devices are on the same network,
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.840]   Wi-Fi network, it syncs your playlist, videos, and photos.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.720]   It's awesome.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.160]   So great.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.120]   When you want to refresh your workout playlist,
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:29.160]   or get more songs in the go, you
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:33.160]   don't have to break out that USB cable, which is so good.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:33.960]   Much better.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.120]   Yeah, AirSync.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:35.960]   Yeah, AirSync.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.760]   And it worked really well.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.400]   I set it up literally during the time
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.920]   that we were setting up Twig.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.240]   Yeah, neat.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.720]   But that's like an hour and a half,
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:45.600]   but still impressive.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.440]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.520]   Our number of the week for Mr. J. Jarvis.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.280]   Thank you for generously not stepping on it.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:50.800]   I didn't see it.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.960]   I have no idea what it was.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.160]   Thank you.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.320]   Very, no, I know you don't.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.000]   I know you don't.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.600]   And the line that you weren't going to say was that iPhones
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:00.920]   are from Mars and Androids from Venus.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.720]   Or the other way around, actually.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720]   Is it?
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.760]   Because menus are Android.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.360]   It's from Mars.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:06.880]   Oh, right.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.560]   Oh, geez.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.360]   Go ahead, take my number.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.640]   Get back in your cave.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.960]   I don't know what the number is.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:25.520]   So men are 32.6% of men want an Android versus 28% want an iPhone.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.880]   For women, it's the reverse.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.720]   Oh, that's obvious.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:35.520]   9% want an iPhone and 22.8% want an iPhone and 22.8% want an Android.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.760]   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.240]   The iPhone is for girly men.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.960]   Also for all the inclusion.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.560]   Yeah, it's for girly men.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.800]   You are girly men.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.600]   You have an iPhone.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.720]   Oh, I hope you enjoy it.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.400]   Do you have a beautiful bamboo case for it?
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.080]   But when size matters, my--
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:54.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.480]   --bigger urine.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.400]   That's a good point.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.080]   You got a giant.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.440]   You got a giant one there.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.600]   You know, just a point about this.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.240]   I really-- it's all about the marketing, right?
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:03.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.640]   The iPhone commercials are like one woman showing off boots
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.720]   that she just bought to her girlfriend over FaceTime.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.600]   And the droid commercials are like this robot ball.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.400]   Like, you know, like, power or nothing.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.000]   I hate those droid commercials.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.080]   I hate them.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.400]   I know, I know.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.960]   And but that Google has no control over that,
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.200]   because that's Motorola and Verizon.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.640]   It has nothing to do with Google.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.160]   Well, it also certainly shows that the pad brand
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.280]   didn't matter at all.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.560]   Right.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:31.240]   Yeah, because they don't do anything for that.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:34.880]   I would say the women would react badly to pad.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:35.920]   Oh.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.320]   Oh, interesting.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.320]   It's forgotten, right?
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.880]   That's the amazing brand, right?
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.520]   Any company's brands, people just suffer over them
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.720]   and suffer over them and suffer over them and suffer.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:44.600]   Doesn't matter, does it?
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.680]   I didn't know how to pronounce Verizon for two years.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.400]   And at some point, it doesn't matter.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:48.840]   Right.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:49.840]   It's the brand.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.400]   Because it gets in your head.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.600]   My tip is actually for Mac users who use Gmail.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.280]   It is a new Mac email client that's designed for Gmail,
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.280]   although they say that eventually it will support
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.240]   other IMAP servers.
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.640]   But it is a very elegant way to--
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.440]   I'm actually replaced to Apple Mail now,
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.040]   because all of my mail is on Gmail.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.000]   It's called Sparrow.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.600]   And it's currently in beta, so it's free.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.000]   Beta 6 just came out.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.080]   SparrowMailApp.com.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.640]   And actually, let me bring it back.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.360]   For one thing, it really worked well on the air.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.960]   You can hide the Doc icon and just have a menu icon.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.520]   It's very clean.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.440]   If I open the display, you can see,
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.880]   it kind of looks more like a traditional mail.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.520]   It does support labels.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.440]   So I can see all my Gmail labels in here.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.600]   It does a great job.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.880]   I have multiple Gmail accounts.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.240]   Here's my regular Gmail account.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.720]   Here's my Google Apps Gmail account.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.720]   Very simple to respond back.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.160]   In fact--
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.720]   It's a priority yet.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.880]   You know, I guess-- well, Gina is priority a label.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.360]   It should, if it's a label, right?
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.560]   It's a reserved label.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.840]   It is a label.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.440]   Let me see.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.520]   Yeah, I think it's important or something like that.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.200]   It's important.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:04.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.120]   Let me see if I see--
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.000]   no, see, I profile message.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:08.760]   No, I don't see it.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.880]   So I guess--
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:13.400]   but I'm sure-- you know, this is in rapid upgrade mode.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.920]   It doesn't do one thing that I really like,
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.600]   which is the ability to use PGP or S-Mind to sign mail.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.200]   I do like to sign all my mail.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.520]   But it does support archiving.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.800]   It does support deleting as well.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.720]   It is just a very quick and elegant way
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.280]   of doing your email if you're a Gmail user.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.760]   And you know, you've got stars.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.640]   You've got sent mail.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.760]   You've got all the labels here.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.640]   I've got drafts and my trash can.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.760]   And just, you know, when you close the preview window,
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.280]   it's just a little thing sitting right there.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.880]   Really nice in the MacBook Air where it doesn't take up
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:48.480]   a lot of room.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.360]   That's called Sparrow.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.240]   It is free right now.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.280]   I imagine they're going to charge for it down the road.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.200]   But the beta is free.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.120]   Sparrow mail app.com.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:57.080]   Mac users only.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.800]   But I know a lot of Gmail users use Macs as well.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.440]   Hey, that's it for this week in Google.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.200]   Matt, so much fun to have you on.
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.120]   Any time you want to come by, we'd love having you.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:06.600]   Yep.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.680]   It was a true pleasure.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.560]   Thanks for having me on.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.800]   matcuts.com.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.600]   M-A-T-T-C-U-T-T-S.com/blog.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.280]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.480]   Matt, who improves the internet every day.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.640]   Yes, we can thank Matt for his good work
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.480]   at Google keeping spam results out of our service.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.440]   His work is never done.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.000]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.560]   Well, luckily I have a huge team that helps.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.160]   So--
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.640]   OK.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.480]   You're not-- not all you?
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.080]   No.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.320]   No.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.240]   I don't speak enough languages for one thing.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.160]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.960]   Matt, I do have a serious question.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.040]   I do have a serious question.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.600]   Because I say all the time that I would think
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:47.000]   that you would be the most unpleasant guy in the worst mood
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.720]   on Earth feeling with the stomach.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.920]   Spam, wait a minute.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:52.280]   Why are you one of the nicest people I know?
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.600]   How do you do that in your head?
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.440]   I'm serious.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.000]   How do you do that?
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.960]   It's so sunny, I know.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.320]   Well, I have gotten a little more of a thick skin
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:19:59.880]   over the years.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.240]   People can call me a lot of stuff.
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.880]   And I'm like, oh, that's not the worst thing I've been called.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.280]   That always helps.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.920]   Do spammers actually call you?
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.440]   Oh, sure.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.400]   I've got-- you know, people--
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.000]   yeah, they get frustrated.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.600]   The occasional death threats, stuff like that.
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.880]   But it's pretty rare.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.320]   They have Russia or Nigerian accent.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.560]   Yeah, it varies.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.920]   It varies.
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.280]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.040]   That's his blog.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.600]   His book is What Would Google Do?
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.080]   Soon to be Public Parts.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.400]   Any day now.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.920]   And the next book will be How to Have a Pink Face.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.960]   You're good at it.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:33.440]   You've got it.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.880]   You've mastered it.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.760]   He's also a professor of journalism at the City University
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:38.320]   of New York.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.000]   We love having him on the show.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.720]   And the wonderful Gina Tripani, who is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.920]   And I'm sorry, smarter where.org.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.960]   I would like to have more.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:48.480]   I'd like to have more.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:48.960]   That's because.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:49.920]   That's because I'm a smarter where.org.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:53.040]   And you're putting-- you're going full-time at think tank now.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:56.560]   Yeah, well, you know, I've been full-time leading think-up
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.840]   development for a while now.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:01.360]   But yeah, I'm kind of cutting down some of my freelance stuff.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.400]   And I'm going to go kind of dive into coding more,
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.840]   which I'm really excited about.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.120]   That's cool.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.000]   But I will be working with doing a new edition of the Life
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:08.480]   Hacker book.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.600]   So I am going to be working with Adam Pash on that one
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.840]   next year, which will be fun.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.360]   Awesome.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.440]   And also one thing that we didn't mention today.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.480]   There's an official Google Reader app out for Android.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.680]   So search for Reader on the market.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:18.680]   Yes.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.680]   Oh, oh.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:20.200]   It's brand new.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.400]   Oh, I'm going to wait for that.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.720]   I should have mentioned that as my tool.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.280]   I'll have to download that right away.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.320]   You can use-- I'm getting my nice big thing where I'm going
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.080]   to play--
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.560]   That's made for Google Reader.
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.160]   So you got on the tab.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   Made for Google Reader, isn't it?
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.960]   What were you saying, Matt?
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:39.240]   You can use the volume knob to go scroll through items.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.280]   The Apple wouldn't let you do that.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.080]   Yeah, you get knocked out of the marketplace for that.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:50.720]   Think-up is the place to go to learn more about Think-up-app.com,
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.040]   I should say.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.760]   And you can now download it and put it on your web server.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.560]   You've got PHP in MySQL.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.160]   Very cool.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:58.720]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.320]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.520]   Well, I'll get you that, Gina, Gina.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.520]   Hold on one quick.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.160]   I don't find it.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.080]   What do I search for?
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:04.840]   Reader.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.320]   Reader.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:05.840]   Just reader.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:06.400]   Just reader.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.520]   OK, thank you.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.600]   Sure.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.200]   Now you can see me by the way.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.320]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.400]   We'll see you next time.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.480]   I'm not going to be here next week.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.440]   I'm at Lou Webb in Paris.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.760]   Jeff, are you going to host?
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.040]   I think you're going to host, aren't you?
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:18.720]   Am I all good?
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.160]   They put you in charge.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:20.920]   Or maybe-- I don't know.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.240]   Maybe Tim-- Tom Maredell will sit here in the studio
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.280]   just to keep you coming.
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.800]   Yeah, it's a gallatarian this show.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:26.280]   It is.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.440]   There really isn't a host.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.080]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.080]   We'll see you next time on "This Week" in Google.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.520]   Bye-bye.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.820]   (upbeat music)
