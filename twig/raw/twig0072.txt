[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.080]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.280]   to show the covers Everything Google, which
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.120]   means everything the internet.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.800]   Kind of a dry week for Google.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.080]   We'll try to make the best of it.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.680]   Joining us-- I'm filling in for Leo the Port, by the way,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.840]   who's in France.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.480]   So joining us as usual, unlike me, Gina Trapani
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.720]   from smarterware.org.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.640]   Hey, Gina.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.400]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.160]   Christmas came early for Twig this week.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.600]   I know.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.200]   Very excited.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.080]   Hacked with stuff.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.920]   Also with us, of course, Jeff Jarvis from buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.400]   How are you doing, Jeff?
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.600]   I'm not pink yet.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.440]   I will be as the sunset's here.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.000]   Well, you look human this week, which is good.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.520]   That's a good thing.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.480]   Kind.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.120]   And also joining us, Kevin Purdy from lifehacker.com.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.320]   How's it going, Kevin?
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.480]   Hello, greeting smart IT.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.200]   I'm happy to be on Twig with you guys.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.840]   Thanks for letting me join along with you.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.800]   Let's start with-- I don't know.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   Where do we start?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.640]   Well, let's start with the big one, right?
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.240]   The Chrome OS announcement from yesterday.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.920]   This was long and got more interesting as it went on.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   They started by going over Chrome's browser, which I think--
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.440]   I don't know.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.120]   Do you guys agree?
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.400]   The biggest thing there was Crankshaft
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.720]   being added to the V8 JavaScript engine.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.320]   I didn't hear anything that was entirely new otherwise.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.600]   Was I missing something?
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.320]   That was about it.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.320]   I mean, basically, Chrome is really fast.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.480]   Chrome is getting faster.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.920]   A lot of people are using Chrome.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.840]   That was the summary.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.600]   And security.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.440]   They did a big security thing, which is nothing new for them,
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.640]   either.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.320]   The whole sandboxing of different things.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.560]   The Google Chrome Web Store was also unveiled.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.160]   That was new.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.240]   It's a curated Web Store with apps that can work offline.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.880]   You go in and you install an app in Chrome.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.480]   You can access the store from other browsers,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.760]   but you have to be in Chrome to take advantage of the apps.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.360]   They are HTML5 apps.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.520]   Payments won't be integrated until Q1 in the United States,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.440]   but you can go check it out, chrome.google.com/webstore.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.680]   Do we-- what's the opinion across the board here?
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.200]   Let's hear from everyone.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.160]   Do we need a web app store?
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.880]   Because it's a little different than an app store on a phone.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.680]   Maybe not.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.800]   Jeff, what do you think?
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.560]   Sure we do.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.360]   Sure, absolutely.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.760]   It's the depth of Microsoft.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.200]   As I think they said at the presentation,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.400]   Microsoft was nice enough to provide an app for the web.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.960]   All right, you know, listen, at some point is the web.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.800]   Wired said the web was killed by apps.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.400]   I don't think that's true.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.800]   Is it killed by new devices?
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.320]   I don't really think so.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.080]   But I think that the idea that I can buy anything there,
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.720]   my son, who's a developer up here in Rochester,
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.960]   was asking him last night.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.000]   I think it's a new place for developers to write.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.480]   It's a new place to earn some money.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.600]   It's a new place to get new kinds of variety and apps
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.040]   for the web itself that can go far beyond what
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.880]   a mobile device can do.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.600]   Sure.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.920]   I can't wait.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.720]   What do you think, Gina?
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.360]   I think that when I started to use it,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.600]   I thought, well, this kind of just seems like glorified bookmarks.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.560]   But what it really is about is just discoverability, right?
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.120]   Google needs to show consumers what they can do on the web.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.960]   Like, yet they were asserting that you can do anything
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.160]   on the web, that you can do in a native app, which
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.200]   was quite an assertion, I thought.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.800]   I'm not sure I totally agree.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.760]   But they need a place to show people, hey,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.920]   if you want to listen to online radio, here's where you go.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.120]   If you need to edit an image, if you
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.760]   need to create an org chart, if you need a web app,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.600]   or text editor, and all those things
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.640]   are in the Chrome web store.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.240]   So while on one hand, they felt like,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.720]   this is a little underwhelming.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.640]   On the other, it was like, this makes complete sense,
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.160]   because Chrome OS needs to have a place to install stuff
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.440]   and needs to be able to show convince
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.960]   them to consumers that you can just work on the web.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.760]   So absolutely needed, I think.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.400]   Two out of three, agree so far.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.760]   Kevin, you want to make it anonymous?
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.280]   Or unanimous?
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.000]   Yeah, I really like the web store.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.600]   It caught a lot of flack from a lot of snarky corners
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.160]   for being basically, like Gina said,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.840]   and I'm like, oh, I click Gmail, and then
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.800]   I get a link to Gmail in the browser.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.280]   That doesn't seem all that great.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.160]   But they've figured out a way to make offline apps really
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   much more convenient than Google Gears was, which
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.720]   was the predecessor.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.800]   Google Docs is going to come back with offline capability,
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.560]   which is great.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.840]   I think it's just a really cool way to show people what's
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.560]   really capable in a browser, if nothing else.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.480]   Maybe not everything right now is a slam dunk,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.680]   but it shows you what is possible and where it's headed.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.120]   I was one of those snarky corners.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.600]   You're talking about it first.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.040]   No, I looked at it and I said, well, this is just
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.240]   a really nice portal.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.160]   Why do I need an app store or call it an app store for something
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.720]   that's just a directory to sites on the internet?
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.800]   Because that's all these apps really are, except for the offline apps.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.280]   Well, but let me ask you, Tom, at some point,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.560]   don't you get the successor to Microsoft Word as an app
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.000]   that you'll have an account with.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.280]   And yes, it's your portal to that and to your little quarter
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.080]   of the cloud with the functionality there.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.040]   Is not going to come.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.880]   I've got Google. I type docs.google.com, man.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.400]   Why do I need to install an app?
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.120]   Well, what if--
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.080]   Anybody else's apps or anybody else's stuff?
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.280]   When we get to HTML and we get to fancier things,
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.440]   maybe I'm completely full of crap that's happened before.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.920]   No, it's--
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.480]   It's the discoverability.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.800]   It's the discoverability, for sure, I think.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.920]   Just finding this.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.160]   I ran a blog that Kevin's at right now for years.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.200]   90% of it was just like, hey, look at this cool web app.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.680]   So now the store is just an entry point for people who don't know about--
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.480]   Well, most people know about docs.google.com,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.000]   but a lot of people don't know about Aviary or that TweetDeck
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.760]   has a web-based client or that kind of thing.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.280]   And if it was just a cool directory of places to go on the web
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.960]   to do cool web app stuff, then I would get that.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.400]   But I think the installation and the idea of treating it
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.320]   as if they're independent applications is what I was getting hung up on
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.760]   until something you said, Gina, which was the idea of it being the app engine for Chrome OS.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.240]   Once they started showing Chrome OS, it all made perfect sense to me.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.480]   That's what it's all about.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.600]   And there are apps in the App Store right now that only work on Chrome OS
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.080]   networks.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.080]   Like Google Talk, you actually can't install in the standard Chrome browser
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.640]   only enough.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.160]   So they're definitely holding some stuff back until Chrome OS really gets out there.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.280]   And that was the final part of their announcement was Chrome OS,
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.240]   which is essentially Chrome browser running on a thin operating system.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.200]   They're touting the quick setup, the instant resume, the ability
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.760]   to sync with other devices.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.320]   So you pick up a Chrome OS, you log into your Google account,
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.480]   and that is your machine.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.280]   It has all your apps, all your data.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.960]   Everything is stored in the cloud, and other people can do the same.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.440]   They're talking about the security of that and how it's protected from somebody
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.280]   finding your data that way.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.720]   And then I thought the killer was when they started talking about the built-in data.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:25.200]   So they've partnered with Verizon here to give you 100 megabytes free data every month,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.280]   not a lot.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.400]   But at least if you have a Chrome OS device with 3G built-in,
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.360]   you have some data that you can get without paying anything, all
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.120]   a Kindle, even though there's a cap on it.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.440]   And then you pay for the rest of it.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.840]   Isn't that just a freemium model?
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.600]   It is a freemium model, isn't it?
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.800]   Which is like, hey, you get enough to get by for free,
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.040]   but if you really want to make better use of it, you pay.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.320]   Not like that really makes it the device you can take anywhere.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.440]   Because literally, even if you're the huge cheapskate,
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.920]   you don't want to pay a dime for data, you can always send that emergency email.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.840]   Or if you use services like Google Voice, you can always send that emergency text,
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.440]   that email, that emergency document.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.680]   It's really cool to have something in your backpack that can always
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.440]   get online whenever.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.880]   And that's part of the big appeal I'm assuming.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.720]   Question for you guys.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   Agree for sure.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.240]   What's the requirement for being able to work offline?
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.480]   Does each app need to be written differently?
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.160]   Is your data stored differently?
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.200]   How is that going to work?
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.720]   Or could I take any app with any data and be able to use it offline?
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.680]   I'm pretty sure that your app has to be written in such a way
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.200]   that it takes advantage of HTML5's offline storage capabilities.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.400]   So all apps, just any app won't work with it.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.320]   It has to be kind of HTMLified from what I understand.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.720]   I haven't actually done this myself, but that's what I understand.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.520]   Well, that makes sense, because there are HTML5 sites right now
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.800]   that you can't just save to your desktop and use offline.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.920]   But there are some you can't.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.280]   In fact, there are some cool apps for phones, where you're essentially not--
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:09:59.880]   it's not an app.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.800]   You just save it.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.080]   There's a whole marketplace for those kind of apps.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.200]   That's an independent app store where it's just HTML5 sites
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.040]   that you save as bookmarks.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.160]   And they run inside of the bookmark.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.720]   You don't have to actually be connected.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:13.920]   Right.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.760]   And they take advantage of the offline storage just storing
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.600]   inside the browser, storing data inside the browser.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.160]   Has everyone signed up for the Chrome OS pilot program?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.640]   Twice.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.160]   Yep.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.680]   Twice.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.680]   Twice.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.520]   Me too.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.400]   I signed up during the announcement.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.600]   As he was talking, I was frantically
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.840]   going over to the website.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.480]   It's google.com/chrome notebook.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.360]   And you sign up if you're part of a business,
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.600]   or if you may already be signed up through your--
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.840]   they have a few partners that they're doing it with.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.120]   And then there were people who signed up on the Facebook page
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.000]   with this QR code that get sucked in.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.840]   They had no idea they were going to do this.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.240]   And then if you sign up and you can apply at google.com/chrome notebook,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.200]   what they'll do is send you a net book called the CR48.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.240]   It's a play on an isotope of chromium.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.560]   It's 12-inch display, full-size keyboard, 3G, dual-band Wi-Fi,
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.040]   eight hours of active battery, eight-day standby, webcam.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.560]   No caps lock key, though, even though it's otherwise
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.720]   a full keyboard and no function keys, either.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.880]   But also no hard drives.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.960]   It's all solid state.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.800]   And you'll be able to play around if you're selected
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.840]   with Chrome OS in advance.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.640]   I was kind of snuggled--
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.400]   Why is it almost four pounds?
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.600]   Why is it four pounds?
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.440]   That's a really good question.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.400]   I thought it'd be this really light, wonderful light
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.840]   thing that would beat the air.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.960]   That's the whole advantage of being web only.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.600]   And you take all this stuff out of it.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.080]   And it's 3.78 pounds, and it's big and ugly.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.960]   Unbranded, though.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.320]   A lot of people really like that.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.280]   That it's totally unbrand-- almost just black tab
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.000]   that you carry around.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.120]   What is making it that heavy?
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.080]   It's got a solid state drive in it,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.280]   so it's not a big old hard drive in there.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.840]   Be able to see the price for it.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.200]   Is it because it's just bigger, is cheaper right now?
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.280]   I haven't seen any pricing for it, have you?
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.240]   They're not going to sell it.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.320]   It's just a prototype.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.080]   It's totally just a prototype.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.400]   Yeah, it's not going to be for sale at all.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.960]   I think it's only for the pilot program
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.000]   and for internal Google testing.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.520]   But I didn't realize actually how heavy it was.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.200]   What I thought was interesting that on the CR48 site,
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.600]   it said, we left out the caps lock key, the function keys,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.640]   the spinning hard drive, and the lap burns.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.960]   So that felt like a little bit of a jab at Apple Notebooks.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.080]   Because we've all burned our lives.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.240]   Sometimes I want to use the caps lock key when I want to shout.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.560]   I saw a report that said they have 60,000 of them to send out.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.600]   So that's a lot of prototype.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   That is a lot of freebies if you're right.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.440]   Not only are they not selling them,
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.800]   but people who get them get to keep them, you think?
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.560]   That's a good question.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.280]   I'm not sure.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.720]   I'm not sure.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.840]   I was so hell-bent on just trying to acquire one.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.640]   I wasn't thinking about the sending pack.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.640]   Yeah, what are the terms of service, right?
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.120]   I just clicked.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.040]   Yes, I agree.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.000]   Like Shun has said that aloud.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.760]   Yeah, but Samsung and Acer are following up
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.160]   with netbooks after this prototype goes out, right?
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.440]   Right.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.240]   Mid 2011 is the target date when we'll actually
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.880]   be able to buy them from vendors.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.560]   And they say other vendors will join in after that.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.280]   I'm excited about Chrome OS.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.160]   As much as I was skeptical of why I needed an app store
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.280]   in my browser, Chrome OS looks like a fantastic device
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.880]   to try out.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.160]   I would be willing--
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.200]   That's the whole point of it.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.080]   It's not for the browser.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.720]   It's for that.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.640]   And I said in my application, I would
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.160]   be willing to try to live in Chrome OS for a week
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.440]   without using any other computer and see how it went.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.640]   You hear that, Google?
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.040]   But what do you mean?
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.840]   I need Skype.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.400]   I need Skype to do Twig.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:44.920]   Well, yeah.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.720]   Gina, you said in your blog post that you question the--
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.160]   there's a statement that anything can be built as a web
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.000]   app because it can compile code, right?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.760]   I mean, it would be hard to create a code compiler
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.200]   or some kind of programming tool in a web app.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.520]   Yeah, I'm running Rescue Time, which
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.200]   is this app that monitors all the applications that you
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.040]   use on your computer.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.440]   And my top applications are like Eclipse and the terminal
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.120]   because I'm primarily a software developer these days.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.920]   And then after that, it's Gmail, Google Calendar.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.240]   It's all browser stuff.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.400]   But I was thinking like a true code IDE
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.040]   and doing full-on development.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.280]   And it mazes me that there are thousands of Googlers
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.240]   who have been using this prototype full-time.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.680]   It's like Google engineers are using the Chrome OS,
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.040]   a Chrome OS prototype to do their work.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.800]   What are they-- it just makes me wonder,
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.800]   what are they developing in?
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.240]   How are they doing sort of advanced engineering stuff?
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.720]   Unless Google has web-based tools
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.160]   that they haven't shown us for their employees.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.440]   Right, right.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.680]   But you know the idea of editing code in a browser.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.640]   I mean, I know you can do it.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.880]   There are a few apps that you can do that with, right?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.000]   There's a couple of collaborative coding, code text
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.520]   that are not kind of thing.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.640]   But compilation is an issue.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.800]   And just, I don't know.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.560]   I just never got into it myself.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.360]   And then there's always the like, what about Final Cut Pro
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.160]   or kind of heavy video editing?
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.000]   I know you can do that to some extent on the web.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.400]   But it still feels like it would be kind of a light experience.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.320]   Well, maybe they're using the Citrix thing
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.920]   to do the code compilation where they just push their code
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.880]   through there because the Citrix guys came up
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.920]   and did a good demonstration of how you can actually
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.240]   have your enterprise apps through Chrome OS.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:27.680]   Right.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.320]   That's true.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.160]   Like a remote desktop kind of situation, right?
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.640]   Like a big one.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.080]   John Gruber, who said that the iPad is like the bicycle.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.880]   It's not the car that you drive to get a long distance.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.320]   It's not the walk you take around the corner
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.200]   to grab a cupcake or chipotle.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.720]   But it's your bicycle.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.240]   It's the in-between tool for when you need to do a little bit
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.200]   more than a walk and a little less than a drive.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.880]   Is that what the Chrome OS network is?
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.080]   I think that that's actually-- yeah.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.120]   I think that that totally works.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.280]   I have a netbook that I love.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.960]   It's my kitchen living room computer.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.400]   I look at Epicurious while I'm cooking.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.720]   I get on Facebook while I'm watching TV.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.840]   And this seems like that.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.240]   And it takes a long time to boot up.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.440]   And I share it with my wife.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.520]   It sounds like Chrome OS would be perfect for that.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.160]   And also a perfect travel computer
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.000]   because I'd be able to get online wherever
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.960]   because of the data connection built in data.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.200]   Yeah, I was thinking travel because, I don't know,
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.000]   maybe it's a powered bicycle.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.520]   But it's a little bit more than I use my tablet for.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.400]   I use my tablet sort of around the house the way you're
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.240]   talking about you use your netbook, Gina.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.320]   But it's really hard to use that when you're traveling
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.960]   and you need to do a little more.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.280]   You want to have multiple windows cut and paste is clunky.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:33.720]   And it's actually--
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.760]   But where this really goes is an architecture too.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.040]   It's not just the device.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.920]   It's the architecture of this.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.880]   And it says that when you can be connected
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.440]   to any device you find, you can almost imagine
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.480]   a new kind of phone booth.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.680]   And I can go on into the cloud from a device
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.280]   or a friend's device from whatever.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.880]   And so just like the iPad, I think
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.280]   these are transitional devices that
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.400]   lead us to being connected more at a lighter way
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.320]   and more into the cloud.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.360]   Almost overshadowed in all of this
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.760]   is the fact that Chrome 8 has gone final with the PDF viewer,
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.480]   web store support, and some more of that sandboxing.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.360]   All three recordings.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.440]   Yeah, go ahead, Gina.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:11.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.480]   They had actually released-- this
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.880]   was the version that they were talking about
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.680]   at the announcement yesterday.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.240]   But it came out last week.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.560]   And a couple of bloggers had kind of said, hey,
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.000]   it looks like the web store is in this.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.480]   And I kind of noticed these new features
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.760]   and they hadn't made a big deal about it.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.640]   So it was funny, yesterday, I think John Grouper was saying,
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.240]   there's no new version of Chrome.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.960]   And it's like, well, yeah, it's just been out for a week.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.520]   There's no new version of Chrome,
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.480]   but there's still the old new version of Chrome.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.840]   Right, exactly.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.600]   And then on Monday, we discovered Google eBooks.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.760]   This is what was previously referred to a lot of times
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.440]   as Google Editions.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.720]   Google eBooks Store is not going
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.880]   to wait for them to figure out the legal status of orphaned
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.380]   works.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.000]   They're going to go right ahead with the traditional public
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.120]   domain that's not controversial and some other deals
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.280]   that they've struck with publishers.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.040]   And we'll have the ability to read a book you buy from Google
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.680]   anywhere you have an internet connection.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.920]   So you can read it in a browser or they
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.200]   have some apps available for different platforms
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.520]   that you can read it in as well.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.400]   And this looked to have a little bit of a Trump on Kindle,
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.720]   because with Kindle you had to actually install Amazon.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.840]   But with Google, you could read it right in the browser.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   And that's their best.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.200]   Yeah, but Kindle also doesn't have a browser app coming up.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.640]   Yes, it is coming out.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.160]   They demoed it, actually, during the--
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.880]   They demoed it at Google--
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.120]   During the Google announcement, which I thought was interesting.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.880]   It was interesting.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.320]   I see a Google Books app on the Kindle.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.960]   That's what I want to see.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.480]   You know, I have the Google Books.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.080]   I downloaded the first book.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.600]   And unless somebody can tell me otherwise in the chat room,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.080]   please, there's no way to mark the book.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.800]   Oh, you mean that?
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.840]   And that notes are bookmarks.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   Either anything, just leave any fingerprint on it.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.480]   It feels rushed.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.800]   It's nice text.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.800]   It looks good.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.600]   I think it actually uses pages, which
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.900]   is a beautiful thing versus the
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.560]   Kindle locations.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.960]   But I can't do anything.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.720]   Yeah, it actually tells you how many pages
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.360]   you have left in a chapter and stuff like that,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.040]   rather than the-- you're 62% through your book.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.800]   I hate that.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.040]   Yeah, I can't.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.760]   It makes you crazy.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.240]   It kills footnotes.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.560]   The Kindle kills footnotes because you can't have a common
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.560]   location.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.920]   It takes away books where the original URI, right?
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.480]   The page number was the original URI.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.800]   And you could find it again, and somebody else could find
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.240]   it again.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.400]   And Kindle broke that, which is stupid.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.840]   So yes, page numbers is good.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.920]   But I also need to be able to mark stuff and make notes
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.560]   and do other things.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.080]   And that functionality, unless I'm crazy, I cannot find it
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.240]   in the Google Books app.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.960]   Yeah, I haven't tried to find that either.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.840]   I know the footnotes thing in Kindle, though, you just click
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.800]   and it takes you to the footnote and then you click back.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.960]   No, no, I'm saying when you're writing and you need to--
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.880]   You need to just do a footnote.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.280]   You don't have a URL.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.560]   You don't have a universal resource locator, right?
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.360]   You don't have a-- you don't have that for any page in the
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.600]   book if you're reading a Kindle book.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.560]   Right, exactly.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.880]   So that page numbers matter.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.280]   And they are a common point to be able to create links and
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.120]   things and Amazon broke it.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.920]   Kindle brought it back.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.080]   I mean, Google brought it back.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.480]   I am unable to figure out how to add notes to Alice in
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.000]   Wonderland.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.600]   I'm trying right now.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.720]   Chatroom, help us.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.680]   You even mark words, right?
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.800]   None of that.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.240]   I can't find any of it.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.760]   Well, it is.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.360]   So it feels like it was a rushed app.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.960]   Yeah, maybe this is just early days.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.320]   It's sort of a proud tradition of long betas.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.800]   I like the idea of being able to get my apps in a browser
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.120]   anywhere.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.360]   And Amazon says they're going to do that too.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.840]   But I guess the advantage Google e-book still has then is
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.760]   you can read a Google edition book on a Sony reader or on
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   a Barnes and Noble Nook.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.760]   You can't read it on a Kindle because it doesn't support
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.200]   the format.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:01.520]   But it's available on a wider variety still than a Kindle.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.960]   The other thing to call is to-- which is-- sorry, Jeff.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.840]   The way it's weird to have to make the call, if someone's
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.680]   looking to buy an e-book reader now, and you usually try to
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.560]   buy devices like this based on the network behind it, who do
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.800]   you believe is going to stay in the e-book market longer, Google
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.520]   or Amazon?
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.360]   Yes.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.520]   That's a good question.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.280]   I've been thinking this too.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.600]   I mean, I'm pretty invested in the whole Kindle sphere.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.560]   And when I think about books, I think Amazon.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.640]   So I've already got a bunch of books in my Kindle app, which
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.360]   I can use on my Android phone.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.280]   It's a decent enough app.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.400]   I'm gotten used to it.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.320]   I'm not sure that I would switch to Google Books just yet.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.480]   I also just hate the idea that I'm going to have e-books in
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.840]   different places, behind my Google account or behind my
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.880]   Amazon account.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.680]   But I guess this is just the way it's going to be for a
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   while.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.320]   Even if you have your own on the web, you still have to
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.160]   choose which website you're going to and which web reader
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.640]   you're going to pull up in.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.120]   Right, right.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.320]   And you know, competition's a good thing.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.520]   I'm not complaining about that.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520]   I actually says a good thing.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.400]   Competition's a good thing.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.440]   But as a consumer, it's like, oh, but I've got this whole
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.040]   library of Kindle books and I know how that all works.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.360]   So I'm not totally convinced on the Google e-books yet.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.040]   It's more fun.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.560]   The other one finds something on Google e-books though.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.680]   They have a better 404 page.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.160]   Yes, they do.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.920]   They created what's called quail fail.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.360]   Google Books is charging sales tax in New Jersey and Amazon
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.520]   digital books don't as far as I know.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   In New Jersey or Amazon digital books?
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.160]   That's where I live.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.880]   I live in New Jersey.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.760]   So it depends on what state you're in.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.400]   But I don't believe that I pay sales tax on Amazon.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   Certainly I don't pay it for physical.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.800]   I don't believe I pay for digital.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.600]   But Google Books is charging sales tax.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.960]   Well, I think eventually they're going to have to get sales
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   tax figured out for all of these things, don't you think?
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.880]   I mean, the government--
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.440]   It's not a question of figuring it out.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.960]   It's a question of assisting them.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.400]   Well, yeah.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.360]   And I think the governments are going to decide either that
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.760]   there's going to have to be some national internet sales
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.360]   tax that's split up.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.200]   Local governments are as much more--
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.800]   More your commerce goes on the internet.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.280]   I'm not saying I want that, Jeff.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.200]   But don't you think that's inevitable that they're
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.720]   going to push for that?
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.000]   No, I still don't think it is.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.360]   Maybe in some far future.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.040]   But I think that right now this is still about growth
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.760]   and about encouraging this.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.720]   And it's an issue in many states.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.960]   New York got it.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.240]   But I think that it's going to affect
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.400]   how the internet grows.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.960]   And that's an issue right now.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.360]   We have the whale fail page.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.960]   If you want to take a look at it--
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.040]   we never mind.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040]   We don't have it.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.400]   We're close to Page on me.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.200]   There we go.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.320]   So there it is.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.440]   It's a playoff on the Twitter meme.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.480]   Instead of a fail whale, you have sort of a Melvillian
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.800]   whale fail.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.240]   Google's having trouble finding that page.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.600]   Does that mean that that page is--
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.480]   that's when you're reading the book.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.240]   And it just can't get to the next page.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.760]   Because that's not good.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.200]   Yeah, that wouldn't be good.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.840]   I don't think it's that.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.680]   I think it's more just like, yeah,
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.560]   broken permalink from elsewhere.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.880]   Google's Andy Rubin also showed off a secret tablet
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.040]   at D-dive into mobile.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.600]   It's a Motorola device.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.400]   And it was running Gingerbread, right?
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.120]   Or it's going to.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.920]   How do you call it?
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.280]   It was running the next one.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.240]   OK, it's supposed to run Honeycomb.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.080]   The Honeycomb was built a tablet.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.480]   The penis tap.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.760]   That was my tablet.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.000]   Andy's got to hand it over.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.560]   I'm ready.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.080]   Nice.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:42.080]   The screenshots in the video showed a few very tablet-specific
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.240]   changes that it looks like they already made.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.000]   The lock screen was slightly different.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.320]   I think you tapped a point, as opposed
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.960]   to having to do that big slide that you do with Android.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.400]   And a few other things.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.680]   It's really interesting.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.680]   You would bring that out so early.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.800]   Yeah, this seems to be a new pattern for Google
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.680]   is to go and find a suitable stage
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.720]   and kind of secretly pull out a device
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.640]   that they haven't announced.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.560]   Eric Schmidt did it with the Nexus S
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.680]   without saying what it was.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.840]   And now Andy Rubin does it with the tablet a day
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.480]   before they have an official announcement.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.160]   So they try in different strategies here.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.920]   I was thinking about how that kind of prevents, I think,
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.440]   the excitement of this brand new launch or something
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.600]   that's available right away.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.760]   I really like that they show things early
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.000]   and that they iterate and that things have sort of a long--
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.520]   you have a long time to kind of think about it and digest it
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.320]   and for them to iterate and get feedback.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.280]   But at the same time, you don't have that same--
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.200]   I wait it online all night around the corner
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.280]   to get this new secret thing that I know I'm going to love
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.720]   and can have my hands instantly.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.400]   I don't know.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.960]   It's two different strategies.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.480]   I like Google's approach.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.520]   But again, it kind of takes away that exciting,
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.120]   kind of launch bang when it actually does become available.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   And we've seen that now the strategy is going to be Android
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.760]   on the phone and the tablet.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.720]   Chrome OS is meant for the netbook, right?
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:05.240]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.520]   It's strange that there--
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.800]   I mean, the only Android tablets previously
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.760]   were very unofficial type tablets.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.040]   But now they've got the Galaxy S and they've got the secret $10,000
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.360]   Motorola prototype that Andy was showing off.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.880]   And I don't know if anyone would really want Chrome OS
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.360]   on anything but a netbook or an old laptop.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.160]   I mean, I can see the other way.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.040]   I can see how people might want Android on a netbook.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.120]   But I don't really see Chrome OS seems
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.400]   like a pretty specific use.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.560]   I don't know if you guys agree.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.200]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.560]   A lot of people are saying that the Android Chrome OS
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.800]   divergence is this indicative of this split
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.720]   within the company and how they shouldn't be pushing these two
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.520]   products and they're competing platforms.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.320]   But it just seems like Android's the touch operating system
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.680]   and Chrome OS is the computer operating system.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.960]   It's a difference between iOS and OS 10.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.000]   And they're very different because, yeah,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.960]   Chrome OS is the operating system for the device
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   with a real keyboard.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.680]   And the constant connection?
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.600]   Yes.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   Well, I mean, you can argue that Android does as well.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.680]   I mean, there's definitely some overlap.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.520]   And some Android devices do have keyboards,
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.000]   physical keyboards.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.640]   But yeah, I definitely want Android on my tablet.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.840]   No, I don't want Chrome OS on my tablet.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.280]   I think that I would take Chrome OS on even if there are left
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.960]   in the world any desktop machines,
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.320]   a shared machine in a library, a bigger screen,
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:29.920]   that kind of stuff.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.640]   I can see the fact that it's just--
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:36.280]   it's what Son talked about years and years ago and wanted
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.160]   for years is the dumb device to the smart network.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.760]   And I think I can see a lot of uses for it, actually.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.640]   And it's instant on and all that.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.960]   It's great for shared machines.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.560]   You're right because of the fact that they silo you.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.360]   You have to log into your Google account.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.960]   But is that a good thing to have to log into Google
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.000]   to get into your machine?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.320]   I mean, that is one thing that makes me a little--
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   It's the master plan.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   If you have nothing to hide, Tom, why are you afraid?
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.120]   And just like Android, there's a backdoor in that.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.320]   A company could take the Chromium OS
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.640]   and build a Bing netbook that you log into Bing and all that,
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.960]   I think.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.520]   And just like Android, you could technically
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.520]   build a phone that was entirely open source
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.400]   and doesn't have any Google apps on it if you wanted to.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   And there is the guest account on Chromo OS.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.840]   If you just want to be tin foil hat paranoid,
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.640]   you just always use the guest account.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.240]   You never actually signed into anything.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.000]   So trade off that.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.520]   I mean, the interesting thing about Chromo OS
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.720]   is that it's a sort of this new operating system,
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.480]   computer operating system that has been developed
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.080]   after the web as we know it.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.360]   I mean, Windows was built at a time
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.160]   where you're buying software and boxes off shelves OS X2.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.080]   So this is like the first post-modern web computer
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   operating system.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.880]   It's really interesting, even though it's not
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.880]   the sort of hot touch mobile device craze
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.800]   that's happening right now.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.480]   I think that a lot of people are like, oh, whatever,
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.600]   computer operating system, no one uses computers anymore.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.720]   It sees hand-held devices.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.480]   But it's still kind of interesting.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.400]   I'm really excited about the security stuff
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.800]   and that tight cloud integration
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.480]   that no other OS really has.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.000]   And Android on the tablet's doing well.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.240]   Samsung says they've sold one million Galaxy Tab units.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.280]   Does anybody heard whether this is shipped or sold?
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.680]   I still haven't found a clarification on that.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.320]   Either way, it's still impressive.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.880]   - I don't know what it is.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.560]   - Yeah, shipped being that Samsung has made a million
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.520]   and shipped them out to retail,
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.880]   but they haven't necessarily been bought yet.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.480]   Sold would mean people actually--
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.360]   - Like bragging how many of my product models.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.760]   - Yeah.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.920]   - But is one million, that's good, right?
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.760]   - It's good.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.360]   I'm saying I'm liking the thing.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.400]   This is the second week I've had it.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.280]   And I had a type of memo on the airplane
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.120]   and used it.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.680]   One box is the killer for this.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.320]   One box is absolutely great.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.160]   And it goes back to what Chrome is gonna be like.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.520]   And so everything, there's no such thing as sinking, really.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.720]   It's just there and I grab it.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.080]   And it's the same in both places.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.280]   And that makes this thing really good.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.440]   Using it as a GPS device in the car today
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.520]   here in Rochester, just follow the road with snow on it.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.400]   It's, I'm liking it.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.000]   - All right, let's take a quick break
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.400]   and thank our sponsor Squarespace.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.960]   If you want it easy to use UI to make your blog,
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.200]   sing the praises of anything,
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.320]   whether it's your tablet, your phone,
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.400]   or your new netbook, or whatever it is you wanna shout out
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.920]   about, go to Squarespace and start a blog.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.720]   If you're a beginner, it's fine for you.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.960]   But if you're an expert saying,
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.160]   I don't want something for beginners,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.680]   you can tweak the CSS to.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.120]   They've got a ton of modules, blog module.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.760]   In fact, an import module is really good.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.680]   If you're already a WordPress or blogger,
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.520]   moveable type blogger, you can import your code
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.080]   over to Squarespace and try it out, see how it works,

[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.120]   and you think it's gonna be really popular,
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.640]   you want someplace that can scale

[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.600]   So we briefly mentioned earlier that the Nexus S
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.840]   made an appearance on Eric Schmidt's lap,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.400]   and now we have some more details about it.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.160]   Best Buy is going to sell the Nexus S from December 16th.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.920]   It'll come with Android 2.3 Gingerbread.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.880]   You'll also be able to get it at bestbuy.com
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.320]   after December 16th as well.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   And this is officially now the reference design for Google,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.120]   but they're changing the strategy a little bit, right, Jeff?
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.920]   I mean, this isn't the same as the Nexus One.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.240]   Right, I mean, they're not selling it directly.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.920]   Google's out of the phone store business.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.280]   Samsung reportedly didn't wanna call the Nexus Two,
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.880]   it'd be second line so it's the S.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.720]   They have the Google, the Best Buy deal.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.840]   And I think it just becomes the confidence it gives me
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.600]   is we'll always have a pure Android unit.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.480]   It's gonna sell for $529 if you want it unlocked.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.400]   Although, I mean, I don't think it works
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.960]   on the AT&T network for data.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.840]   You'd be able to make calls on the AT&T network,
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.480]   but I don't think it has the right bandwidth.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.680]   You get edited, not you get the source.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.320]   Right, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.080]   It is $199 with a two year service agreement with T-Mobile.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.840]   Resalivate and over it?
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.960]   - Except for the T-Mobile part.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.280]   - Yeah, is that the part that brought you down, Kevin?
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.640]   - Well, yeah, I mean, I'm a T-Mobile customer
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.480]   and I have a Nexus One and I like it fine enough,
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.960]   but T-Mobile's really a good enough network.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.160]   I mean, if you don't mind,
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.960]   if you live somewhere where you have good coverage, great.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.200]   But I wonder how they're able to get such a sweetheart deal
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.800]   with Verizon for the netbook
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.120]   and then to release the next reference device,
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.640]   they decided to go with T-Mobile
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.160]   unless it's just something inherent about GSM technology
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.800]   that makes it more apt for their phones.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.400]   I don't understand it.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.640]   - I think so, Kevin, for their worldwide distribution,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.840]   I think the GSM is just a better move for them
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.000]   to get it going.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.960]   - Oh, good point.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.360]   - And it's got the world bands.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.120]   Couldn't they have squeezed in the AT&T band as well?
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.000]   - Yeah, I think that's a really good point, Tom.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.880]   It's really irritating and it would be a slap at the iPhone.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.520]   Take your sim out of the iPhone and try something.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.720]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.720]   - The iPhone is a micro sim though,
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.560]   and this is a full sim not to get too nerdy about it, but.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.520]   - Ah, that's right, if yeah, okay.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.800]   - That's easily remedied.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.440]   - It is, it is technically, right?
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.920]   There's an article on Life Hacker for that.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.400]   - I'm sure there is, but I'm pretty sure.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.240]   - I like it's where I read about it.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.080]   - Probably.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.520]   I don't know, I think they're issuing
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.120]   the Gingerbread update for Nexus One.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.280]   I wonder how much longer this guy is gonna stay
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.960]   around and still be relevant.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.800]   I hope it does for a while because
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.360]   buying an unlocked device a year ago,
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.160]   it would be nice to have longer than a year
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.920]   on a $500 plus purchase.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.520]   - It's a full advantage of the unlock-edness of it, right?
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.680]   - The unlock-edness, yes.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.040]   Four inch contour display in the Nexus S.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.280]   It is built on a Galaxy S design,
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.880]   but it does have that curved display.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.000]   One gigahertz application processor,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.720]   like you mentioned comes with Gingerbread,
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.400]   16 gigs of internal memory,
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.080]   and near field communication.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.520]   Gina, what do you make of this?
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.000]   Is this gonna be used, or is it just kind of,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.280]   oh, did we lose Gina?
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.240]   Oh, that's why she's been so quiet.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.080]   - Near field communication, Jeff, what do you make of this?
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.600]   - Well, now that we all should be giving up
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.360]   our Visa and MasterCard in support of WikiLeaks,
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.560]   just a joke.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.520]   Well, not half a joke.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.320]   You know, I do think that I was thinking this week a lot
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.960]   about writing a chapter in my next book,
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.320]   Public Parts, about Blippi.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.840]   And as I was thinking about that,
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.920]   and what PUD has done there,
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.520]   it really becomes interesting when you realize the data
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.240]   that flows through your credit card and your purchases,
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.440]   and the extra value that is inherent in that.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.080]   And so going away from the credit card
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.920]   and being able to put everything on an account
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.480]   through a device like this,
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.260]   I think has even more power than we can yet imagine.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.720]   Gee, you just bought that.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.920]   You also want this.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.440]   Here's a cheaper price.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.320]   And here's the service contract, share the price
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.160]   with everybody else.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.240]   Here's transparent pricing for everything.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.600]   Here's trending items that are just being bought
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.720]   in the last hour.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.640]   There's all kinds of things that can happen
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.600]   if that data is live.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.800]   And if we, through our device, have a control on that data,
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.720]   yes, I want to share that.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.640]   No, I don't want to share that.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   Yes, I want to do this with it.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.760]   No, I want to do that with it.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.920]   And it takes away some of the control of our data
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.720]   from the credit card company,
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.240]   though they may still be doing it,
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.640]   but we've become a conduit for it
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.160]   instead of the box, just the box in the store.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.400]   So I think there's a lot to it.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.800]   I know we can make things a whole lot more convenient
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.840]   if you just, you know, even if you didn't,
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.760]   in some cases you might not even have to take the phone
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.600]   out of your pocket, right?
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.000]   Right.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.800]   Gina's back with us.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.280]   We were talking about the Nexus S.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.120]   What do you think?
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.440]   Is it something you'd want to run out and get?
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.080]   Sorry about that.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.360]   Yes, do want.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.160]   The Nexus S.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.000]   The Nexus S.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.840]   The Nexus S.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.480]   Yes. (laughs)
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.320]   Absolutely.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.720]   Although I don't think it's such a huge upgrade
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.520]   that I'll run out and buy it when it gets released,
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.360]   but I will try and arrange some sort of flights
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.200]   so that I can borrow Kevin's at least for a little while
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.280]   to play with it. (laughs)
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.400]   Nice.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   Should you buy it unlocked,
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.920]   or should you buy it with the contract?
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.920]   That's the one question that Eileen and I, my wife,
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.600]   when we first heard about it that morning,
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.320]   we were debating,
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.040]   should you just go ahead and get it with T-Mobile?
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.120]   'Cause in the United States,
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.480]   you're pretty much only gonna make best use
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.600]   of it on T-Mobile anyway.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.480]   Or, Kevin, should I go with the unlock-ed-ness?
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.880]   Yeah, I would, unless you're really into T-Mobile
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.320]   and you found I had really good service.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.840]   I think this has the HSPA network,
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.240]   the HSPA plus, that T-Mobile is installed.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.520]   That's the, you know, I think technically,
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.120]   maybe one of the highest speed 4G,
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.120]   I'm doing air quotes, networks around,
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.760]   but that's actually, I think,
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.440]   a few dollars extra on T-Mobile's network.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.480]   I might be wrong, a comment, chat room,
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.920]   but I really wouldn't,
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.720]   I wouldn't sign up for two years of T-Mobile
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.640]   if I could avoid it,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.720]   unless they're really gonna start
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.800]   stepping up their coverage area.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.080]   Yeah, and I just looked up the specs,
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.520]   it doesn't say that it has HSPA plus.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.440]   Oh, yeah, that was a question mark for me,
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.400]   I thought it would, but just 'cause it's not, yeah.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.520]   Look, Kevin, I agree, except when I bought my Galaxy tab,
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.400]   I went and bought it a lot,
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.320]   and I thought that I was gonna use my Fi
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.360]   and just get this on,
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.880]   and then I realized that I can't take advantage
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.520]   of any of the geography.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.480]   And so I could do it month to month on this,
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.680]   but it's a crappy deal,
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.440]   and you get one fifth bandwidth,
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.720]   so I finally just surrendered,
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.520]   and I did it two year on this.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.560]   Okay.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.320]   And you don't mind the size of that, right?
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.440]   Seven inches, it's plenty for you?
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.520]   Well, it's perfect because it fits my pocket,
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.480]   and here's the thing I discovered,
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.960]   it's just the right width for thumb typing,
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.160]   with fat thumbs.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.800]   Why do you can't do the thumb typing
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.720]   'cause it's too far away?
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.160]   Narrower, don't I know that,
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.440]   it's too close and I'm clumsy.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.320]   So it's a very good width, actually,
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.760]   for typing things and doing things.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.320]   And it's Kindle-sized, which is for reading books and stuff,
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.720]   it's great.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.160]   Video I haven't used it a lot yet,
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.480]   but it seems pretty good so far.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.280]   So yeah, I'm fine with the size,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.760]   and the convenience of carrying it in a pocket is huge.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.240]   And one of the other advantages of Nexus S, right,
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.080]   is that you get gingerbread.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.160]   We got more details about that on Monday as well.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.680]   What are some of the best things about gingerbread,
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   in your opinion, Gina?
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.520]   Have you briefed up on this?
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.480]   A little bit, although Kevin's, Kevin's gonna be expert.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.240]   I just want Andrew to just look prettier.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.680]   Is that, is that so?
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.360]   Does that make me a bad, a bad nerd?
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.600]   I just want it to look prettier,
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.720]   and I think that that gingerbread does bring that.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.840]   But Kevin's arc on my Android guru,
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.960]   so Kevin, tell us more about gingerbread.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.200]   The design is a little more unified across the OS.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.560]   It's a lot of the many's have gone from gray
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.680]   and white to black, black background, white text.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.520]   Most of the improvements are pretty small.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.800]   The keyboard actually got a pretty good upgrade.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.080]   The text selection is more Apple-like,
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.320]   or even HTC-like where you have two cursors.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.200]   Yeah, there you are.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.080]   Two cursors that you would drag around
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.560]   to select the width of text.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.240]   Previously, you'd be using the track ball,
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.520]   or even your finger if you were very brave.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.680]   Google says that they rearranged the keyboard
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.040]   and made the keys bigger or just bigger targets.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.360]   I haven't had a chance to play with hands-on yet.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.720]   But really, it seems like most of the improvements
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:04.400]   are just corners and details and little niggling bugs
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.040]   here and there.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.160]   Although someone suggested, and I don't know if it's true,
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.600]   that Google is making a push for more AMOLED screens, AMOLED.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.200]   And that's why they went with the dark design,
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.240]   because I believe that you'd then
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.760]   be able to save some power from your battery,
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.800]   and Android notoriously does not have a great battery life.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.680]   Most of them don't.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.120]   And I believe with darker designs and darker menus,
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.560]   with certain kinds of screens, you'd actually
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.120]   get more battery life out of it, which is interesting
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.000]   if that's what they're doing.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.720]   And you can actually get the Gingerbread keyboard
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.160]   on the current release, 2.2 right now, right?
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.600]   If you root it and do some sort of black magic.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.720]   It's a little bit of hacky, but I
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.040]   don't think it's full-scale rooting.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.440]   So yeah, you can get the Gingerbread keyboard pretty quickly
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.360]   on your 2.2 phone.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.960]   I'm just so happy that there's no Windows pointer that shows up
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.120]   when you select text anymore.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.040]   That always freaked me out.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.160]   Like I was like, oh, no.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.800]   It's totally in Congress to the rest of the system.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.840]   There's no other white diagonal pointer in Android,
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.520]   except for when you went to select text before.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.560]   It seems like we dropped in from outer space.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.960]   And it gives Jarvis an excuse to call Android Windows again,
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.560]   which always freaks me out, too.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   Or Leo.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.960]   Or Leo.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.200]   Right.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.600]   That's right.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.880]   Gingerbread ROMs are also starting to get cooked.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.240]   There's some folks who are making them for the Evo 4G,
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.560]   the Droid Aris, and Wildfire.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.880]   They're still in development stage.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.560]   So unless you're really wanting to contribute to development,
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.480]   they say that you should hold off on them.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.960]   But that's good news in many ways, right, Jeff?
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.160]   I mean, I think it's advanced the religion.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.280]   We'll take it as soon as we can.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:50.600]   I would like to have a Gingerbread ROM running on my iPhone.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.520]   You could do that, right?
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.840]   Well, eventually.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:59.800]   You go back to your question about Chrome on one device
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.120]   and Android on another.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.440]   You start to wonder whether you can put these things
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.680]   at all kinds of different devices.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.320]   Can I put the Gingerbread ROM in my car?
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:12.280]   That's an interesting idea, because then you
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:17.920]   could have an in-dash tablet, essentially, right?
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.840]   Exactly.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.520]   And so you get to the fabled connected refrigerator.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:28.520]   If you had a ROM, where all other manufacturers put it.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.760]   Now, the problem with that becomes the account problem.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.560]   It becomes the problem of, oh my god,
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.160]   I've got to have 10 phone numbers now.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.760]   And that's not going to scale personally.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.520]   We just use Google Voice.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.400]   But in terms of connectivity, if you wanted
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.000]   to have mobile connectivity for your car,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.400]   you have to have a connection to a cell network.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.040]   But if they get past that idiocy,
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.480]   we'd have multiple cells in one account,
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.840]   with multiple sims in one account.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.040]   And I could just go back and forth from device to device
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.040]   to device.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.680]   And I carry something with me that says,
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.320]   Jeff's here, connect his account now.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.160]   That'd be pretty cool.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.840]   Yeah, it would be.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.360]   That would be really--
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.280]   Amen.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.400]   I want my Android enabled refrigerator
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.400]   to let me know that my milk is expired when I'm at the grocery
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   store.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.120]   Can I have that Google?
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.080]   Would you hear about the folks who
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.720]   are trying to develop a food tube internet-like system
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.680]   in Croydon, England?
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.000]   No.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.360]   They want to connect supermarkets, public buildings,
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.920]   and schools.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.080]   It's like a big pneumatic tube, where you put the food
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.960]   in capsules, and then it's run like the internet.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.360]   It's packet switched so that your food just goes through the tubes,
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.000]   and then it's delivered to you because it knows it scans
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.480]   the capsule and says, OK, this one goes over here.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.760]   So you combine that with your refrigerator running
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.840]   the Android drop.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.440]   You don't even have to go to the store.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.400]   The refrigerator order is the milk for you.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:49.920]   I love it.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.120]   And what if they run another tube,
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.240]   and you can just shoot into the supermarket yourself?
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.360]   Jumping in the floor in your kitchen, and there you go.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   Transportation problem solved.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.360]   Oh, goodness.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.880]   And you know what?
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.880]   The beautiful thing about that is that a Chipotle burrito
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.440]   will just fit in the tube.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.480]   Oh, perfect.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.360]   I love it.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.280]   Well, the capsules are big.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.040]   You could actually get the whole family order at Chipotle.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.120]   With guac.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.200]   With extra guac.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.640]   What do they charge for?
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.960]   What do they charge for salsa there?
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.320]   That always bothers me.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.400]   Salsa should be free.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.160]   I'm for socialized salsa.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.680]   Hey, would you guys in the cabin--
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.880]   to me, if they were--
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.000]   would you guys in the cabin take Leo on a field trip
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.600]   to Chipotle for us?
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.240]   We'll find out where the nearest Chipotle is.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:34.440]   Why?
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:39.080]   Does he-- see, he doesn't dig the Chipotle, huh?
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.040]   I don't think he's ever been.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:40.480]   Yeah, OK.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.240]   Well, we'll introduce him to the ladies.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.040]   He's not taking the-- he's not joined our cult.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.640]   He still thinks they're owned by McDonald.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.160]   Oh, he needs to.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.040]   He's probably the problem.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.280]   Salsa wants to be free.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:50.880]   Chat room.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.440]   It's got to be--
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.440]   Salsa wants to be free.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.520]   It does.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.600]   That sounds like a show title to me.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.640]   I think it's Lawrence Lessig's next cause.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.600]   I'm going to push for him to take that up.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.960]   Free salsa culture.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.680]   Yes.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.840]   So we have another story here.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.640]   Business Insider ranking the top flops of the year
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.120]   and some Google products showed up.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.800]   I've got my opinion about this.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.040]   It's a pretty good list.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:16.880]   I want to hear yours.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.720]   Number 15--
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.880]   We've reached all 15 of them.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   Wait.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.920]   I don't know if we have time to read all 15 of them.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.600]   What's your favorite, Jeff?
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.720]   Well, no, not readable.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.760]   Just list them real quick.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.360]   Oh, yeah, let's--
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.560]   Let's go real quick.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:32.640]   Number 15 Nexus 1, 14, 13 hot potato, 12 AOL seed
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.480]   platform, 11 blackberry torch, 10 sorry, Gina.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.440]   I won't even say it.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   You know what?
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   Oh, no.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.480]   Twitter is really bird.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:49.840]   8 Google-- 7 Goala, 6 Apple iTunes Ping, 5 Crunchpad Juju.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.280]   That's a good one.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.360]   4 It's you, which is the right.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.400]   3 Google Buzz, 2 HP Slate 500.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.280]   And number one, the number one failure in the business insider
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.520]   list of failures in 2010 is kin phones.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.400]   Ah, the kin.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.640]   Ah, the kin.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.520]   It is back, though.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.880]   You can still buy it.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.720]   It's called something.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.960]   It's called-- what is it again?
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.200]   They changed the name of it.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.400]   They put it back out and then called it the Kin-D or something.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:20.880]   They just--
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.240]   At least they followed up with the Windows 7 phone, right?
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:24.760]   I mean--
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.240]   Well, yeah.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.480]   Nobody understood-- I don't think anyone at Microsoft
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.320]   understood why they were doing the kin.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.120]   That's a decent list, although I called BS on Nexus One.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.840]   I mean, Nexus One may have been a mainstream consumer failure,
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.520]   but you go to any conference where there are serious Google
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.520]   nerds and they're carrying a Nexus One.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.600]   Yeah, I don't think the Nexus One is the failure.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.800]   I think that it's the attempt to change the way
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.240]   cell phones were sold is the thing they didn't succeed at.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.400]   That idea that you could just go online--
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.400]   And God wasn't for trying.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.680]   Yeah, I thought it was a great attempt.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.440]   Right.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:56.940]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.280]   They ran into the Howard-Biel moment.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.840]   So where someone pulled them aside and said,
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.240]   you were messing with the fundamental forces of nature
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.560]   and they just had to shirk away.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.160]   Even Google wasn't big enough to shoulder the carriers
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:10.520]   out of the way.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.720]   Is that what you're saying, Kevin?
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.120]   Yeah, to try to Europeanize it where you can just buy the phone
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:17.480]   and then buy your service and not worry about it
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.840]   and not do two-year contracts.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.960]   It's just unfortunate.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.800]   Do we ever get away from that?
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.560]   Because that is a fundamentally anti-consumer system that
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.360]   has been organically mutated out of the conditions
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.160]   that we had in the '90s when they built out
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.600]   the cellular networks.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.120]   How many--
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.960]   Well, people now are so used to the idea,
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.200]   their phone being something that they can replace every x
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:41.640]   years.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.840]   And if I drop my phone, no big deal, I'll just get a new one
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.160]   when my credits come up.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.200]   It's hard to replace, I think.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.080]   It's a very sticky situation.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.680]   And they went from one-year contracts to two-year contracts.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.280]   There's even been some three-year contracts.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.760]   Although I think people have drawn the line.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.040]   They're like, no, I'm not going to do a three-year contract.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:04.640]   Not the way phones are changing hands all the time.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.920]   So anyway, on this list to the other Google things
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.200]   were Google Wave.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.520]   I'm sorry, Gina.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:10.960]   No.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.680]   It is not dead, though, right?
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.400]   I mean, it's still an open source project.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.800]   In to live on is an Apache open source Apache project,
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.440]   which I'm excited about.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.280]   We even box.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.080]   Buzz was certainly a good choice here.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:26.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:29.960]   TV is kind of early to say, but it sounds like--
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:33.640]   Everybody is pretty roundly, soundly.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.080]   Yeah, the G1 of--
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.400]   Mine's back in its box.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.680]   I took my Logitech review and I put it back in the box.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.080]   I was this close to returning it when
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.880]   I talked to somebody who mentioned
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.000]   that it was going to get a firmware update that included
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.280]   the marketplace after the first of the year.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.880]   And I decided, all right, I'm going to hold out,
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.640]   because Google TV might still turn it around
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.640]   with the right apps in a marketplace, don't you think?
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.140]   Good.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:03.120]   Now I recommend that you do a reboxing video.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.640]   I'll unbox it again and do a reboxing.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.120]   That's a good idea, Jeff.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.680]   I might take care of that.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:14.280]   That would be a good series for just sort of demonstrating,
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.040]   you know what?
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.200]   You don't want this.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.400]   We're going to rebox it.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.680]   I like that.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.920]   All right, let's thank another sponsor for this week in Google,
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.200]   Ford and the new Ford Fiesta with its EPA-estimated 40
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.520]   highway miles per gallon.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.560]   No other compact cars, more fuel efficient.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.360]   Fuel economy is just the start, though.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:38.880]   The 2011 Ford Fiesta can be driven at a dealer near you.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.280]   Ford is committed to the environment.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.040]   It's got the EcoBoost V6 engine.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.920]   It's a 365 horsepower engine.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.840]   And you can feel it when you drive the Ford Fiesta.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.880]   It's got pickup and fuel efficiency at the same time.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.080]   If that's what you're looking for, you get a lot of power.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.320]   Essentially, you get the power of a V8.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.720]   And it does with direct fuel injection.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.880]   You can test drive a global test.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.520]   There's the 2012 Ford Focus Global Chest Drive,
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.880]   now through December 31st, 2010, submitted video,
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.560]   saying why you should be selected for the test drive
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:12.800]   and what charity you think Ford should donate $10,000 to
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.160]   in your name.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.520]   And they'll send you and a friend to a secret location
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.960]   in Europe to test drive the all new 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.120]   You can learn more at a-- there's a Facebook page.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.080]   You can get to very easily by typing in twitfordfocus.com
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.240]   and upload your video by December 31st.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.440]   That URL, again, is twitfordfocus.com.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.320]   And we invite you to stop by a dealer, Ford dealer,
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.040]   and drive a new Taurus show, the SHO, or a Ford Fiesta
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:40.880]   this week.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.840]   See what the innovations at Ford are all about.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.640]   Another Android phone that was leaked out
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.240]   is the Offed Rumored PlayStation Phone.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.840]   Kevin, do you have any info on this?
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.520]   Is this real?
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.480]   It looks more real every time we see a video.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.360]   We finally got a clear video this week that showed someone
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:01.760]   using it rather than a blurry video from a Greek train.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.320]   I am sorry.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.320]   I got nothing on this one.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.160]   You got nothing on this?
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:09.240]   Anybody else got anything on the PlayStation phone?
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.600]   No, no takers.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   I want the PlayStation phone.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.880]   What do you think of the control system, Gina?
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.920]   Have you seen the little nubs that are supposed
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.520]   to be the joysticks?
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.320]   You know, I-- we saw this a couple of weeks ago,
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.400]   and I was like, oh, that's just sort of silly, but it's real.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.080]   It's interesting.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.960]   So it uses the thumb pads to navigate around Android,
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.400]   basically.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.800]   Can you play Angry Birds better on it?
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.600]   Possibly.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.760]   I mean, well, the idea is you've got the two little nubs,
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.200]   right?
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.160]   And so there's the-- there's thumb pads,
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.920]   just like you have on a PSP.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.480]   But then the control sticks are those two little nubs
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:47.640]   in the middle so that it's like a touch interface.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.600]   But you can't really see them in the picture
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.000]   we're showing in the video.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.400]   It's right below that S. There's those two little things.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.720]   And then that tells you where the center of the control stick
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.520]   is, and you just move your thumbs around in order
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.200]   to send the control with that so they don't
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.600]   have to build an actual movable stick in there.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.240]   And that allows it to slide under the screen.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.120]   Interesting.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:13.760]   So is this like the iPod Touch kind of game--
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.120]   I don't know.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.040]   I guess it's not really a direct parallel.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.600]   It's similar to the iPod Touch's little circular thing,
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.880]   except with that, you kind of have
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.920]   a look or just remember where your finger is.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.760]   But there's a little physical cue.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.920]   So you know, like, OK, that's the center of the stick.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.240]   But for those who can't see it, it
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.040]   looks like from these previous shots
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.080]   that the whole Android system is in their settings, places,
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.120]   phone, navigation.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:38.320]   It's not some kind of rig together Android device.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.760]   It looks like it's running a full Android system
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.160]   with just probably a few built-in games
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.760]   or focus on games.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.480]   Yeah, they claim it's running Gingerbread in the story
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.360]   I saw in Android Community.com.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.800]   Hmm.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:57.440]   Everybody's got Gingerbread but me.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.480]   You don't have it either, do you, Gina?
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:52:59.980]   No.
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:00.480]   No.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.400]   Everybody's got Gingerbread except me and Gina.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.000]   Please send ROMs.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.400]   Until Gina knocks the Googler office bike and runs away.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.240]   Right.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.400]   Exactly.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:12.280]   That's why those bikes are scattered all over their campus.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:16.320]   People knocking them off trying to steal their Gingerbread.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.280]   Twitter ran into a security issue.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.480]   A couple days ago now.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.000]   And it was reported on Search Engine Land
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.680]   that it was goo.glurls that were the security issue
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.400]   because there's no preview on that.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.840]   So they were circulating on Twitter.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.840]   People would click on them.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.680]   They would get infected.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.480]   And then it would propagate.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.760]   It was a cross-site scripting attack.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.280]   Is that essentially what was going on, Gina?
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.280]   Yes.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.680]   That is what was going on.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.680]   Actually, I got the email from Google
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.400]   because I apparently signed up for website
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.800]   and I'm an optimizer at some point about this as well.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:54.600]   And I'm actually not totally using it.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   But I thought that Google handled it pretty well.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.560]   They're pretty quick to explain what happened
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.160]   and issue the fix.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.520]   I actually didn't see reports of this on Twitter itself.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.360]   I never experienced it in real life.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.280]   I just read the stories about it.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.480]   Jeff, did you or Kevin either one?
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.440]   Did you see it in real life?
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:13.920]   No.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:20.240]   I didn't-- so I don't believe it happened.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.360]   If I didn't see it.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.000]   That's it.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:22.680]   That didn't happen.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.760]   It's the quantum uncertainty of URLs.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.960]   But I'll be honest.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.160]   I don't see goo.gl short URLs all that often.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:33.720]   Yeah, me either.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.480]   And I see follow Mac cuts on Twitter.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:35.960]   Yeah, OK.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:36.480]   Right.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:43.040]   Google Cloud Print was also part of the Chrome OS
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.600]   announcement that we talked about earlier.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:49.800]   This is their attempt to get rid of drivers.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.360]   They say, actually, across the board,
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.440]   they want to get rid of drivers so that you just
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.560]   connect to the devices directly.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.720]   God bless.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.240]   Oh, please, right?
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.720]   Jeff, how long has it been we've gone through this stupidity?
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.200]   I have a new HP printer that I can't-- I give up?
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.520]   I can't get the Wi-Fi going.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.480]   I can't hook up to it.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:09.120]   I just give up my Galaxy tab.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.880]   I can't print to it unless it's a Samsung printer.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.720]   How stupid is that?
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.840]   It's just a stupid printer.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.240]   They don't do any different.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.960]   They go A, B, C.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.920]   [GRUNTS]
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.840]   I love Jarvis Rans.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.080]   Kevin, you set this up.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:26.680]   How does this work?
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.760]   You actually upload your drivers to Google?
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.720]   Yeah, and I tested it out.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.880]   I set it up in Windows, and then I
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.160]   used a different Windows computer to test it out.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.400]   Basically, it seems like when you set it up in Chrome,
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.160]   you have to be running the latest version of Chrome
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.520]   in Windows, I think even the dev version at this point,
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:45.760]   there it is.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.080]   You have to give it a little chance
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.960]   to check out what drivers you have on your Windows computer.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.080]   And then when you plug in somewhere else
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:56.120]   and you're running Chrome and everything synced up for you,
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.280]   you can then print to any of those printers
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:02.320]   that you had drivers for on your Windows computer
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:03.720]   there on this different computer.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:09.240]   And so I was able to print to my HP desk jet, three and one
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.880]   or whatever, and worked fine.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.720]   I mean, the test page worked fine.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.000]   I didn't really try it much beyond that.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.480]   But it looks like it's working in this very niche case
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:23.000]   for Chrome dev users on Windows to have it set up for syncing.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.520]   But it's really promising.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.280]   So you don't have to be on the same network.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.200]   You can do it over the internet.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.520]   And your computer, obviously, that
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:31.320]   has the printer connected to it has to be on, right?
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.240]   Yeah, that's the idea is you could print back
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.440]   to your presumably desktop or mini computer that's hooked up
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.600]   to your printer.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   Gotcha.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.920]   Just as soon as I started selling tiny little computers
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.600]   that hook up to printers and do nothing else,
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.480]   but accept Google connections will all be free.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   Yay.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.000]   Right, right.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.560]   And so you don't have to install anything else.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.080]   It's just Chrome that like figures out that just--
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:53.720]   Chrome and you--
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:54.560]   Chrome's clear.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.480]   --to the preferences and set it up
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.480]   in the under the hood section, and that's it.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.240]   I mean, they must be kind of doing some kind of mini driver
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.160]   in the background for it.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:08.080]   But we're trying on HP and even worked fine on my little PDF
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.120]   printer that I have installed.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.120]   Cool.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:14.800]   Vitaly Borker, who ran the decoromaiis.com site.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.880]   You guys talked about this.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:21.520]   I know last week, right, on Twig, is under arrest
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.920]   for the fraud charges.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.640]   So Jeffy not only didn't get his site really as far up
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   in SEO as he claims, but now he's in jail.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.600]   Yeah, and the guy was an idiot talking to the Times,
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.520]   and he was an idiot screwing people around.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.080]   He was an idiot for claiming what he did.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.200]   And now the government's going to go after him with a heavy hand.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.160]   I think he's just a schmuck.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.080]   And-- but he'll never do-- he'll never
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   saw another pair of eyeglasses in this country again.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.880]   I'll bet you.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:50.880]   Not to me.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.080]   The winner was Justice.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.960]   Counterfeit knockoff eyeglasses, too.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.520]   Right.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.960]   Well, it just goes to show that insulting your audience
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.400]   doesn't pay after all.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.360]   We can all rest assured, finally.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.160]   Just didn't make any sense that whole thing.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.880]   All right, let's finish up with WikiLeaks.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.040]   4chan is rushing to WikiLeaks defense,
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.400]   forcing the Swiss banking site that
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.320]   was holding their money offline.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.480]   They froze the account because they said
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.520]   he had given an incorrect address.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.000]   Also, now there are denial of service
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.280]   attacks against MasterCard.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.480]   And there was one set up to supposed
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.360]   to be against Visa because Visa and MasterCard
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.480]   are going to throw this stuff off.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:35.920]   Jeff, is there a way to get money to WikiLeaks
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.240]   if you wanted to?
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.760]   I mean, are they cut off entirely now?
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.480]   I believe there is in the site.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.960]   People have sent me a couple tweets on it.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.480]   I haven't seen it lately.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.440]   Interestingly, WikiLeaks leaked today,
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.880]   a document that says that the US government did favors
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.240]   for both Visa and MasterCard in Russia.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.560]   Hmm, connection?
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.160]   We also have to ease the way into Russia eggs
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.720]   so that they could set a business there.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:05.840]   And Lilweb, the head of PayPal, said that they did,
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.160]   in fact, get pressure from the government.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.480]   And this got booze in the crowd.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:16.040]   You know, I, it's all very, very uncomfortable,
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.480]   but there is one good punch line out of it.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:20.680]   I see, I can't see who gets credit for this.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:26.120]   I think pick IH on Twitter against credit for this line
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.040]   that press freedom is priceless for everything else.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:29.880]   There's MasterCard.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.000]   (laughing)
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.440]   I say, and I should correct myself,
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.560]   4chan, not rushing to WikiLeaks defense,
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:38.360]   but anonymous, which is a group that organizes
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:41.800]   on 4chan quite often, rushing to WikiLeaks defense.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.680]   Subtle but important difference.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.480]   For anyone in New York, this is the last minute thing.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.760]   I want to plug on December 11th,
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.560]   which is Saturday in the morning.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.800]   Personal Democracy Forum is going to hold a teach
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:57.440]   in the bout WikiLeaks, starting at I think 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.760]   With folks like Ariana Huffington, Dave Weiner, me.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.000]   And I think it'll be a really good bunch.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.240]   And I think it's time that we have
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.080]   a different discussion going on.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.240]   We have Newt Gingrich, who just,
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.000]   according to Alan Raspard, or the end of the Guardian,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.160]   I just saw this pass by, has called Assange,
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.280]   quote, "an active enemy combatant.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.480]   "This is an act of war."
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.280]   The rhetoric out of government is becoming frightening
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.040]   about free speech as Matthew Ingram wrote a gig ome
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.920]   this week, where he leaks his acting as a member of the press.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.800]   And if it loses its rights, so does the rush to the press.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:35.000]   And this is a dangerous and important moment.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.600]   Whatever you think of Assange,
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.640]   whatever you think of WikiLeaks,
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.600]   it's still they do what the New York Times does.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.040]   And if you stop WikiLeaks from doing it,
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.400]   you may well stop the New York Times
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.320]   from doing it in the future.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.160]   It's important.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.640]   - It is interesting that all of the,
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.160]   the anger is being directed against WikiLeaks itself
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.360]   when much of the same information is being printed
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.480]   in news organizations around the world,
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.360]   and Der Spiegel and the Guardian and the New York Times.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.280]   And yet they don't seem to think that those publications
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.120]   are as threatening.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.200]   They're going right after the source.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.320]   - Well, Joe Lieberman did come out this week
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.600]   and start talking about trying to try the New York Times
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.360]   under espionage as well.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.600]   - Well, okay, there you go.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.320]   Do you agree with John Battelle?
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.280]   He wrote an interesting article on BattelleMedia.com
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.240]   saying with all of the different mirrors
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.520]   of WikiLeaks that are going on,
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.360]   which just shows the ridiculousness
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.640]   of trying to stop information once it's out on the web.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.520]   It's an infinitely copyable medium.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.520]   And once something gets out, it's out.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.280]   There's no way of stopping it.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.080]   Battelle says, "Shouldn't Google Mirror WikiLeaks
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.640]   as part of its mission to organize the world's information
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.360]   and make it universally accessible?"
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.880]   - Very good question. - Well, I think so,
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.800]   but I could piece.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.280]   - It would get them PR problems.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.560]   What do you think, Gina?
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.400]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.120]   I thought it was an excellent, excellent question.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.320]   Very, very good piece.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.080]   It would be a huge PR issue for them.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.920]   But a very good point in question.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.240]   If that is the Google's mission,
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.880]   then isn't this something they should do?
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.760]   Excellent question.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.160]   So glad that he asked it.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.600]   I would love to know Google's--
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.680]   - The boiler also was a really good piece
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.400]   talking about BitTorrent as the real architecture
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.280]   of this kind of distributed freedom.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.760]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.000]   Absolutely, because that was WikiLeaks' safety valve
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.280]   through all of this was to have an encrypted file
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:24.120]   on BitTorrent in case they got taken down entirely.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.440]   And that's still being traded around.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.480]   All right, let's thank our last sponsor
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.080]   for this week in Google.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:36.080]   This is, of course, GE and the GE Eco-Majination Challenge.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.960]   It's a new program from GE for entrepreneurs.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.560]   They're trying to give $200 million.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.680]   In fact, they're giving $200 million to invest
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.080]   in great ideas for improving the way energy
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.600]   is produced, transferred, and consumed
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.000]   here in the United States and abroad.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:50.800]   Three categories.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.760]   First is renewables.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.560]   GE wants to encourage better ways
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.360]   to integrate renewable energy into the power grid.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.480]   Grid efficiency is the second category.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.880]   They want to convert the smart grid to digital energy,
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.360]   improve transparency, reduce waste,
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.440]   give more choices for consumers.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.280]   And the third investment category is eco-homes,
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.600]   where you live and buildings, where you work.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.160]   Energy consumption is growing so quickly,
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.080]   it's creating an imbalance between demand and supply
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.600]   and the mismatch is leading to higher energy costs
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   for businesses and for you, the consumer.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.840]   GE wants to help change how and when we use energy
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.960]   to lower energy costs.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.760]   So they're making $200 million available
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.280]   to invest in great ideas in each of these areas,
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.360]   renewable grid efficiency and eco-homes.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.440]   If you'd like to learn more and read the ideas
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.840]   they're investing in, and you can even comment on them,
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.720]   they want to hear your comments.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.520]   Go to eco-majination.com/challenge.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.520]   We thank GE for supporting this week in Google
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.160]   as well as Green Tech today.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.680]   Be sure to listen or watch Green Tech today in iTunes
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:47.280]   or at twit.tv.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.160]   All right, let's finish up with some tips.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.080]   Kevin, did you have a tip or?
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.680]   - I have a very quick plug and a very quick tip.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.080]   And the plug is for my book, The Complete Android Guide,
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.400]   for all you Twig listeners who are out there
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.480]   who are maybe have someone who is getting an Android phone
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.920]   and they've asked you too many questions already about it
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.000]   or you yourself have one, you want to explore
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.640]   a little bit more of it.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.120]   My book, which you can find at completeandroidguide.com.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.600]   If you type in the code during Google checkout,
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.200]   Twig 2010, TWIG 2010, T-W-I-G-2010.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.640]   The book's half off, so normally it's $9, it'll be $4.50.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.840]   And if you're wondering about all this Gingerbread news,
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.280]   well, okay, so what?
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.000]   And this new version comes out in your books irrelevant.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.640]   As soon as I get my next assess at home,
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.200]   I'm going to upgrade the book and get a new edition
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.240]   out as soon as possible.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.800]   And anyone who buys the ebook can upgrade
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   to the next Gingerbread version of the book for 99 cents.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   So--
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.120]   So you have a better upgrade plan than some phones?
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.400]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.360]   Many of my friends have already pulled out,
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.440]   but especially those with AT&T phones.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.840]   But yeah, so Twig 2010, if you buy it
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.680]   through completeandroidguide.com.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.560]   And my really quick tip for iPhone users
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.840]   who want to use Google Voice to make voice over IP calls
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.680]   for free, in other words, use the same kind of calling
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.000]   that you would do through Gmail for free.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.440]   There's an app called Talk A Tone, all one word,
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.360]   talk-a-t-o-n-e.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.600]   And it is a very cool app.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   I reviewed it on Life Hacker.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.640]   You just double tap the contacts tab at the top of the app.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:30.920]   And you can just hit Google Voice VoIP call.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.760]   And it just kind of works, which is kind of amazing.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.320]   You can call your friends for free, call
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.840]   landline numbers for free through your phone's data
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.720]   connection, 3G and Wi-Fi.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.240]   Oh, really?
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.040]   So over the 3G as well, that's great.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:44.640]   And it's just audio.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.760]   I believe so.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.520]   It's just audio, but it's the same kind of free Google
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.720]   voice calling you get through Gmail.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.840]   So with this type of thing, I usually
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.240]   say get it while it lasts.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.000]   Gina, I know you've got a tip that might actually help
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.440]   Steve Martin.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.320]   Yes, that's what it looks like.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.080]   They added something really, really helpful to Google Calendar
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:04.880]   this week.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.120]   The ability to set your time zone when you create an event,
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:11.080]   which really isn't a big deal until you fly across country.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.800]   And then it's a huge deal.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.200]   I have actually missed appointments
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.960]   because when I entered my calendar,
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.000]   I had them at the wrong time zone.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.040]   When you create a new event in Google Calendar now,
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.080]   there's next to the date and time,
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.440]   there's a time zone drop down.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.160]   And you can even set kind of a time zone, separate one
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.360]   for a start and end of the event.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.920]   So if you take off on a flight in San Diego and land in New York,
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.200]   you can put in those times based on the time zone.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.360]   So hopefully Leo got to use this before he went to France
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.240]   this week to schedule his events.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.880]   He was on time this morning when we streamed his talk.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.720]   So he showed up on time.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.280]   Oh, cool.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:46.760]   Cool.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.720]   Good, good, good to know.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.040]   I didn't realize you guys streamed it.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.160]   Will that be available in Twitch specials?
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:51.920]   That's a good question.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.560]   Are we putting that out as a Twitch special?
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.880]   It's already out.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.920]   That's already out.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.920]   Look at that.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.880]   Gee, tee, the Twitch cottage right on.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.600]   What's the tweet of what Leo talked about?
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.080]   I didn't see it.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:04.680]   What's the--
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.040]   Sorry.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.080]   I mean, put you on the spot there.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.480]   He-- it was a roundtable discussion.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:14.240]   I know he had Louis on and Dennis Crowley and--
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.720]   Yeah, another guest.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:20.400]   So it was what he does here, except there and on a stage
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.360]   in front of French people.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.600]   Without us.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.320]   What's that about?
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.840]   We left it home.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:28.520]   What with you, Tom?
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.040]   It's a pleasure.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.200]   Well, thank you.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.320]   You guys are being very helpful.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.040]   I know I'm half brain dead slogging through Leo's schedule.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.880]   I don't know how he does it.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.840]   We don't either.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.920]   And the reason-- I wanted to explain.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.960]   The reason we thought this might help Steve Martin
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.920]   is he called into Leo's tech guy a couple of weeks ago.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.640]   And his question was about calendaring
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.360]   and being able to put in things in the time zone where he is
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.080]   and not have them get all messed up when he moves from time
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:54.760]   zone to time zone.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.520]   So great tip, Gita.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.840]   Thank you.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.040]   Jeff, do you have a number for us?
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.480]   Well, yeah, you almost got to before.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.560]   Thank goodness you didn't.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:05.840]   The number is 1,241, which I checked about an hour ago
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.520]   was the number of mirrors put up for WikiLeaks,
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.120]   which is pretty incredible.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.480]   They made it pretty easy on the site.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:13.560]   Just do this, this, and this.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.320]   Give us access.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.000]   And you've got a mirror.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.400]   And now there's 1,241, which says
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.440]   that you can whack this mole as much as you want.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.760]   You're never going to get them.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.200]   Catty shack.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.840]   Yeah, no matter what you think of WikiLeaks,
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:30.840]   the idea that you could shut down WikiLeaks is naive.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.560]   There was another interview with the BBC.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.840]   And I can't remember which government
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:39.080]   official from the US was saying we ask WikiLeaks to return
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.920]   the transcripts and the documents.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.840]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.320]   Welcome to the internet, folks.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:47.320]   OK, we'll print them out and send them to you.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.280]   But that's the absurdity of the White House.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.680]   The White House decreed that federal employees should not
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.280]   read the cables, even though they're up online.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.400]   And you can read stories about it,
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.880]   but you can't read the cables because they're still classified.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.680]   Right.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.680]   Oh, we had a listener write into Tech News today explaining
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.760]   that once you read a classified document on a machine,
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.040]   that machine becomes classified and then
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.680]   can't be used for anything nonclassified
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.680]   in certain government institutions.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.200]   And since these documents are still considered classified,
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.920]   even though they've been leaked,
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.000]   it's just a bureaucratic nightmare.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.560]   It's an IT problem.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:29.600]   It just got to switch to Chrome and do incognito mode.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.760]   All right, I have a tool--
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.040]   I don't know.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.080]   You guys may have talked about this before.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.680]   Have you talked about boomerang for Gmail?
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.760]   We have not.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.240]   This is from a site called Baden.com, B-A-Y-D-I-N.com.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.120]   They do a few different Gmail plugins.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.520]   This one is a--
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.320]   I use it as a Firefox add-on, but I
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.160]   think they have a Chromat on as well.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   It allows you to set a time to send or receive an email,
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.000]   which the sending part makes sense, right?
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.960]   You're like, oh, I don't want this to go out till tomorrow
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.560]   morning.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.160]   So that's cool.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.000]   But receiving it, if you, like me--
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.400]   and I know Merlin Man would shiver maybe--
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:12.320]   use your inbox as a sort of a to-do list sometimes.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.920]   What this lets you do is say, you know what?
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.680]   I want to get to that one later.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.160]   You boomerang it, and it leaves your inbox
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.880]   and comes back at a time that you set.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.600]   So you're like, you know what?
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.840]   I can't deal with this now.
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.000]   Send it back to me tomorrow.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:25.720]   That's cool.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.240]   That's really cool.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.080]   I tried it out with an invite code.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.440]   It's not public yet.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.480]   But they were really quick to get back.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.320]   You could either sign up at the website for an invite code,
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.800]   or if you follow them on Twitter and then DM them--
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.360]   or I'm sorry, if you tweet that you want an invitation,
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.080]   they'll actually DM you an invitation code.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.400]   And they did that really quickly.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.840]   You know, the genius of that too is
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.760]   that you could tell somebody you didn't get their email
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.040]   and say, look, look at my inbox.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:52.520]   I didn't get it.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:57.360]   And then later that night say, oh, geez, people servers.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.560]   Or you can set it to send you particular emails
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.760]   when you know someone's going to be sitting there.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.760]   And then, oh, I just got this email.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.440]   I have it go.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.280]   Yes, it's like it's the having the friend call you
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.600]   during the data escape.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.480]   Oh, I just got an emergency email.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.040]   Oh, no.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.880]   All right, well, thank you guys very much.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.320]   This has been really fun for me.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.000]   I hope I've done an adequate job filling in--
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:20.520]   You bet.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.120]   --to the big shoes.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.640]   You were awesome, Tom.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.360]   Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.200]   And what are the other plugs?
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.120]   What are the other things?
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:29.840]   What would Google do?
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:30.960]   That's sufficient.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.160]   What would Google do?
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.920]   In the Google e-book store.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.760]   Check it out now.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.240]   Yes.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:35.680]   Oh, is it?
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:36.480]   Oh, oh, I know that.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   It is.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.640]   Gina Trapani, you know, I'm suddenly and embarrassingly
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.080]   blanking on think up.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.840]   Smart-- smart aware to do it, right?
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.240]   And I develop think up, think up app.com.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.640]   I've been using think up.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.840]   I actually need to upgrade it to the latest release.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.120]   But I love it.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:54.720]   Awesome.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.720]   I'm so happy to hear that.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:56.720]   Right on.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.960]   I installed it on Subreliant.com.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.760]   And I use it to analyze my Twitter stuff.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:05.840]   So I will send you feedback about it once I've kept up.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:06.960]   And I have the latest version.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:07.960]   Because I know right now I'd probably
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.440]   send you a bunch of stuff that you'd be like, fixed, fixed,
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:10.800]   fixed.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.440]   Hopefully.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.080]   Hopefully.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:12.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.480]   We love feedback.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.240]   So absolutely.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:14.740]   Cool.
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:15.800]   So glad to hear that.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.320]   Check out smartaware.org.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.960]   And Kevin Purdy, thank you so much.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.560]   And go ahead and tell people about that book again.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.040]   Because I think that's a really good resource for anybody
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.320]   interested in Android.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:26.520]   Cool.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.360]   Thank you.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   So completeandroidguide.com.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.680]   And it's an ebook, 280 plus pages of Android how-to in detail
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.080]   and how to get more out of your phone.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:42.080]   If you buy it now, the ebook, it is half off, 50% off, about 450.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.560]   And the offer code is twig2010, T-W-I-G-2010.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.160]   And of course, you can find Kevin's work on lifehacker.com
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:49.640]   as well.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.720]   That's it for this week in Google.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.520]   I'm Tom Erritle.
