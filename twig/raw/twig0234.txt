[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google and the big story just broke as we go to press,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.720]   as they say. Lenovo buys Motorola Mobility from Google. Is it a huge gain for Motorola,
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.160]   a huge loss for Google? Our analysts explain right after this.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.160]   NetCasts you love.

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.160]   Facebook, the Twitter. Gina Trapani is here from ThinkUp.com. Hi Gina.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.160]   Hello. Good to be here. Watch her carefully because the sun will set in New York City.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160]   Yes, it's getting dark. It is getting dark. I'm going to get darker.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160]   I think more snows on the way. Is it not?
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.160]   No, it's just colder than a newspaper publisher's heart.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.160]   Oh, I love it. That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160]   He's our journalism expert, professor journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   Google Expert II. What would Google do? And of course his latest is public parts.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160]   And Gutenberg, the geek.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   Which today, this is why students could get it, is free.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   What? If you go to, if you go, you can get it today for free.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   The Kindle single version, not the audible version.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   Right. Go to go to amazon.com and type in Gutenberg.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   The geek. The geek.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160]   I never require my students to buy my books.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   So I mean, it's not nice. That's kind of you.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   I think it's a nice thing.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.160]   So, you know, on Sunday we had why gluten free at zero.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160]   Now Gutenberg the geek at zero. You choose.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.160]   Also with his Kevin Marks.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   Hi there.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160]   The expert on open standards.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.160]   A guy who worked very hard first at the BBC, then was hired by Apple to work on QuickTime.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.160]   Worked at Google, British Telecom, salesforce.com.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   He has been everywhere. Nice to have you, Kevin.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   Nice to be back.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.160]   Just before the show began, big news broke.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160]   Kind of a shocker even.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.160]   According to, at first China Daily then Reuters, the New York Times chimed in.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   As did TechCrunch.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   Google is in talks to sell the Motorola Mobility Division, the Moto X, the Moto G phones.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   To Lenovo, a Chinese company.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   Google paid more than $12 billion for Motorola about a year ago.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.160]   Now reportedly you're selling it for $3 billion.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   Although what's not clear is how much of the patent portfolio goes along with Motorola Mobility.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.160]   China Daily says 10,000 patents.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   But it strikes me that that might be something Google would keep a hold of.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160]   Although the patents haven't been as useful.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   Well, we don't know how useful. They might have been a deterrent.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   They haven't used the patents to sue anybody.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   Was there ever a valuation put on the patents or put on the business?
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   No.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.160]   And there were a lot of articles saying, "Why did Google buy Motorola and the consensus seem to be patents?"
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   Although I thought it was a great deal to get into the handset business and make a...
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   Do something a pure Google handset. They didn't really do that.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   They kept the Nexus line.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   They didn't want to give Motorola too much of an advantage because they didn't want to lose Samsung, HTC, LG and all the others.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   Motorola was just yet another hand-saint maker.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   They had much of an advantage by being partnered with Google except for that big marketing budget for the Moto X.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160]   You saw a lot of ads.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   But while we don't know for sure, it seems they were losing considerable amount of money on the Moto X, the Moto G.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   In fact, I just bought a new Moto X, an updated Moto X for a hundred bucks off.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160]   They offered a deal on Monday for one hour.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.160]   I know. I know. What's the point, right?
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160]   But they've been doing a lot of those. I think that's coming back.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   What did you pay for?
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160]   What did you pay for?
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   So, unlocked Moto X, 32 gigs of RAM, wooden back, because that's what I really want.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160]   This is the main reason I bought it. 350 bucks.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   That's a good price for an unlocked.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160]   Very good price.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   It's not a Google experience, but to me, it's more than close enough.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160]   It's better in some respects.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160]   I wish I did have the wake-up of the car.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   That's cheap to look at the Nexus 5, isn't it?
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160]   For 32 gigs? I think so.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   Yeah. 32 gigs was... I bought one last week because mine got stolen.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160]   Storage, not RAM. I'm sorry. I said RAM. 32 gigs of storage.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   Yeah. It's got two gigs of RAM.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   Two gigs of RAM, I think. Or one. No, I might have one.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   Would you own a Chinese cell phone?
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   Well, here's the interesting thing.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   This is the backstory to this. Lenovo already makes phones.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   They make quite good Android phones.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   There were rumors they might make, considering they're a Windows OEM.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160]   They might make Windows phones, but they haven't to date.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160]   They have not yet started selling Lenovo phones in the US,
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160]   although they said they were thinking about it.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   While I don't know how much this sense this makes for Google,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   it makes a lot of sense for Lenovo.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   It's a way for them to quickly get into the US market with...
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   I don't know how popular the Motorola phone is,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.160]   but it's certainly a great US brand, and it has made the US of A.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.160]   What makes sense to me too is that Google gets the value it needs
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   out of play editions, which by the way, it's another story.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.160]   They may change the name of Nexus, but they play in Nexus editions.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   So they get the value out of that. They can make the things...
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   And they were never really meant to be a large consumer, hard-wear manufacturer,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160]   I don't think. I think it's just so out of their sphere.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   Yet they were. They just acquired Nest.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   It's looked like Google has been building a pat portfolio of consumer devices,
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   and certainly they're pushing hard on...
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160]   All right, here's another theory.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160]   Did it piss off the other phone manufacturer?
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   Maybe.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   And there's another story yet on the rundown today that says that
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   Google reached an agreement, allegedly with Samsung,
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.160]   in which Samsung is going to get rid of some of its pretty close apps
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.160]   and get closer to a pure experience.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   It's on the rundown.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.160]   So maybe Samsung is... We're going on our way.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.160]   Google says, "Okay, okay, we're out of the phone business.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.160]   No, stay friends." I don't know.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   It's a disappointment to me, I have to say, because I...
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   Look at those two.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160]   I am a... This is my daily driver since the Moto X came out,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.160]   and as I said, I just bought another one. I like it so much.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   And I liked it.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.160]   Did you want it today knowing this news?
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   Probably not.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   I would certainly want to take a wait and see, right?
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   I don't know what Lenovo is going to do.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   But I like it that it's... I liked how closely tied to Google.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   They were in a feeling like that's too bad,
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   but I guess you might be right, Jeff.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   They needed to do this to a swage.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   I never heard tension.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160]   I never heard complaints.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.160]   I saw any evidence of that.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   There was some speculation there might be.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   None of that seemed to rise up, so it's rank speculation on my part.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.160]   Rank.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160]   It's a head scratcher, otherwise.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.160]   I don't know.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   I always looked at the Moto X and the Moto G as like their first phone
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   and it'll get better.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   And I had kind of the same hopes as Leo had.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   Like, oh, that they'll become a phone manufacturer.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   They'll own Motorola more than be like, oh, they're separate.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.160]   They're operating under their name and their separate business
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.160]   and constantly kind of making them a separate thing.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   But the Moto X is a great device.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.160]   Leo, did you say you wouldn't have bought the Moto X if it was...
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   If Motorola had been owned by Lenovo?
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   Well, it's the same phone, obviously, so I like it.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   But I'd be a little... I mean, part of the reason I like it
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   is because it's a Google phone.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160]   And one presumes it'll get the updates faster.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.160]   You know, it got KitKat within two weeks of the release of KitKat.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.160]   It presumably will get 442, you know, imminently.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160]   I just... I wonder... And the other thing is, of course,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   I worry about Lenovo.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.160]   Now, to their credit, when Lenovo bought IBM's ThinkPad division,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.160]   they did a great job with it and kept that vaunted brand in the forefront
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.160]   and it continues to make excellent ThinkPads.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.160]   And other laptop, Windows laptops.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   So, in that respect, they're good.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   They are, by the way, partially owned by the Chinese government, I believe.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   So this is the part that makes me nervous.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160]   No, hell of an American, we have the NSA.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   Yeah, I mean, who carries? Somebody's gonna spy on you.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.160]   Well, what was the joke which rather have an American server in China
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160]   or a Chinese server in America?
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160]   At this point, you just kind of assume everybody knows what you do on your phone
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.160]   and leave it at that.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   If there is an announcement that Lenovo does say they will be making a big announcement
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   about a major acquisition Thursday morning in Beijing, which is pretty soon, I think.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   This is a big move for Lenovo.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   $3 billion is a good deal, too, I have to say, given how much Google paid $12.5 billion.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.160]   Lenovo has said that companies, tablets, and smartphones will be entering the US
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.160]   and Western European markets by 2015.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   Well, guess what? Maybe not. Maybe sooner.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160]   Although now this would have to be approved, right? And who knows?
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.160]   I mean, I don't know what the approval would look like.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.160]   Will they continue to make phones in the US?
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160]   Will they continue to make the MotoX and Moto G? I don't know.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.160]   Will they lard them with, you know, crap where, like the other phones are?
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160]   That would be a great disappointment to me.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.160]   It's almost 6 a.m. in Beijing.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.160]   Yeah, so it should be soon.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   We're all thinking.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   We're all thinking.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   Apparently, according to Tim Stevens at CNET, Lenovo was taking an active interest
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   in BlackBerry, but the Canadian government said no.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.160]   Remember that?
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   The Canadian government said it has to, BlackBerry has to be perch.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.160]   Majority ownership has to be in Canada.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.160]   Is there any chance that the US government blocks this?
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   I think it's a huge chance.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   On what basis, by the way?
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   We don't like China. I don't know.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   Yeah, technology transfer would be a good start.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   Was there a discussion of that possibility when IBM sold?
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   I think it was, wasn't it?
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   That's a good question.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   Boy, this one has left us stumped.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   It is probably one of the most unexpected things I can imagine.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   They just bought Motorola for a huge amount of money.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   It was 2011.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   It's been over a year, but it just seems like a quick capitulation.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.160]   Google stock is down 1.3%, 1.4%, but then so is all of tech.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   Right.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.160]   Except Microsoft, which is up 1%.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   Right.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160]   Oh, market is tanking.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.160]   Blame Apple.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   So the, well, the one thing maybe for, you know, if Lenovo is going to buy Motorola,
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   the big deal for Motorola is they have US manufacturing.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.160]   It may be that Lenovo is looking to acquire a US manufacturing base
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   so that when there are coming trades over things made in China, they want that.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   So that's one possibility.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   And I suspect any deal they'd have to do with the government would involve, like,
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160]   not shutting down factories.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.160]   Right.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.160]   That's the point where governments get interested in it.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   Right.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.160]   Well, but, you know, various pieces of the phone will still come from China,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   and still have back doors involved in them.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160]   So they're just assembling.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.160]   We just want to keep the jobs in the US.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   No.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   We don't care about spying.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.160]   You can, you can just talk back doors and anything now.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   The story that got me recently was that SD cards are very easy to back door because
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.160]   SD cards have stopped being raw storage a few years ago, and they all run little microcontrollers
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.160]   because the storage is so small now it's crappy.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.160]   So you have to have an OS running a file system on there to sort of hide the defects in it.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:53.160]   And these are all like strange closed source or semi open source microcontrollers that
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   therefore you can take them over more easily because they never get patched.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.160]   So SD cards are a new vector for things.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160]   Right.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   That's nice.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   You've thought of a tool.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   You've put the SD card on your phone and suddenly it's sitting there running software
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   and looking at every image you take and what you call them in time of time and things.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.160]   That's why I've given up.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   Take my stuff, please.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.160]   Anyway, that was the big breaking news as we sat down at the table today.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160]   Hello, everybody.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.160]   Good to see you.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160]   Welcome.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160]   Welcome.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:36.160]   This is, by the way, maybe they're going to use the money to defray the expense for the big,
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   what is it?
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.160]   Deep mind.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.160]   Deep mind.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.160]   500.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.160]   Just half a billion.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.480]   So tell me about that.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   What does that mean?
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   Who is deep mind there?
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.160]   Is artificial intelligence?
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   Mm hmm.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.560]   It's artificial intelligence, but it's self-training networks.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.160]   So training neural networks on noisy data was the coverage I read about and describe
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   what they're doing.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.160]   So if you remember the project where they wired up a neural network and fed it YouTube and
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:11.160]   cat faces, that wasn't them, but that's the good idea.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.640]   It's that same kind of idea, but apparently these guys have been good at training, getting
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.160]   neural networks to train when you haven't got a tight feedback loop.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   The classic neural network is you show it a thing and tell you what the output should
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   be and you train it to give that.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   So you can use it for OCR and things like that.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   Multiple character recognition.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.760]   So you showed a picture of a number six and then you tell it that the output should be
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.320]   number six and you picture number seven and do that over and over again.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.560]   And eventually it builds something that's a little bit like an image recognition for
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.760]   a brain.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:48.240]   One of the things that this group has done, they've taught neural networks to play retro
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:55.600]   Atari video games by showing them the screen and giving them the four up, down, left, right
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:03.640]   and fire buttons and not giving them any rules or in sense the game, just giving them feedback
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.560]   that is points.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.960]   So they've actually got things that can now play break out better than humans.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.960]   Of course.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:17.800]   It's fascinating too, is that as part of the deal, part of what sold Google on the deal
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.760]   created one report, is that they're creating an ethics committee.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.240]   No, it was the way around it.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.400]   They said there's a condition of the deal they wanted in it.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   That's what I was saying.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   It was a condition of the deal.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   Right.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.480]   Because everybody fears Google is Skynet and they don't want Google to get intelligent
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.480]   and etc.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.280]   So the question is, is this to improve search or is this part of the robotics research
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.920]   that Andy Rubin is leading over in search?
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.000]   Remember that they hired Ray Kurzweil, who was one of the premier artificial intelligence
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.640]   experts of some time ago.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.440]   Yes, he still still is.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.640]   Well, his early work was OCR as well.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.600]   He brought machines that would read text for the blind.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   That was his site.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   Right.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.880]   As well as synthesize and a whole bunch of other interesting stuff.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.040]   But the other thing is arguably they're trying to build a different bit of the brain.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:10.800]   So Kurzweil wants to build a cerebellum like the memory and resolving part of the brain.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.600]   It's not memory, it's sort of the layered reasoning part of the brain.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:20.320]   And these guys seem to be trying to build the hippocampus, which is the sort of learning
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.320]   a memory part of the brain.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   I love this.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   I love this.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.800]   Only Kevin Morris would do the anatomical analysis.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.400]   The problem is nobody's building a frontal lobe.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.480]   That's the question is you've got a bit of frontal lobe.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.680]   But also, the bit that no one is building is also the emotional response feedback.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.240]   No one's building a amygdala.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   Who's building a amygdala?
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   We need a amygdala.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.640]   That's the piece we're going to need.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.600]   Yeah, because otherwise you've got a robot that's smart and has no conscience and apparently
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.800]   no impulse control.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   So you're really screwed.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.920]   They should write like movies and stories about this plot.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.200]   It seems like it'd be a fertile area to plumb.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.360]   I had two oral surgery yesterday.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.120]   So I spent the day sitting in front of the TV watching movies with a holy and ice back
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.120]   to my face.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.800]   So I watched really watch 2001.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.360]   So I'm up to date on this.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360]   You're ready.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:17.680]   And also, Chris Weil gave an interview to the Sunday Times last month in which he said
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.880]   that by 2029 they will create a machine that understands language and human emotion.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.040]   Understands it doesn't have it.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.120]   And well before that by 2018, just a few years from now, the Google brain, he's apparently
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.120]   called it the Google brain, we'll have revolutionized searches.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.120]   We know it right.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.640]   This is the quote right now searches based mostly on looking for keywords.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.240]   What I'm working on is creating a search engine that understands the meaning of those
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.240]   billions of documents.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.400]   It'll be more like a human assistant you could talk things over with.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.160]   This is very how to say how 9,000 that you can express complicated even personal concerns
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.040]   to you're always on cybernetic friend.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.600]   I want this.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.760]   Your plastic cow who's fun to be with.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.320]   I don't care if it takes over or starts bitching about all the diodes up and down his left
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   side.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.040]   I want it.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:14.240]   But I mean, you know, we, okay, so they've got the part where you talk to your computer.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.040]   It's now in all versions of Chrome.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   Okay, Google.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   Boom.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   It comes alive.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   Don't say that my, my friends.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.200]   I know this we have pinpointed the problem, by the way, because I was playing with it the
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.320]   other day and people were saying, you're God damn it.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.200]   You keep waking up my motor roll X or my Xbox one or, you know, stop it.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.720]   All the machines are listening now.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.120]   I like the idea of it.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.320]   You know, it's very primitive right now, but you can have a little bit of a conversation.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   God I love it.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   If we just let me talk.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:52.520]   Listen, I think you do life as talk.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.040]   I think this is a, you know, this is a conceptual flaw.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.960]   I know they're all excited about we're voting a Star Trek computer, but the reason the Star
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.040]   Trek computer worked like that was because that way they can actually use it as part
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.760]   of the plot and have them talk to it and have it talk back.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.320]   And actually it's not very practical to talk to the computer when you're in a, in a bridge
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.040]   full of 20 people doing their jobs.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   Right.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.320]   It's not practical to talk to the computer when you're in an office full of 20 people
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.280]   doing their jobs or on a bus or in a cafe or any of the other places we use computers
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   all the time.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.200]   So for me, this is, this is, I don't talk to the, the only time I talk to the computer
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.680]   is when you guys are on the other end of it and I'm doing a podcast.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.920]   Don't get misled though, but don't get misled by that.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.760]   I mean, because you could type your query or whatever.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.160]   The fact that it would be able to better understand your queries, know what you're thinking
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.560]   of instead of what you're actually saying, things like that would be useful.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.120]   Well, you haven't, hold on, hold on.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.680]   When you live in, in cubicle land, lots of people are on the phone or used to be.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.080]   Yeah, it would be hated.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.080]   It's like Kevin's out of work right now.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.840]   If you're, if you're, if you're sitting there trying to write code, you really don't want
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.840]   somebody next to you on the phone.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.880]   There's this, this is a problem that they actually did some research on this.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.760]   And they, they found that people are much more productive when they've got private offices.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.400]   If they're actually trying to do something that involves thinking and not being interrupted
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.480]   and having people talking, what happens is, you know, if you actually look at these open
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.320]   plane offices, everyone has, has bigger and bigger and more acoustic, isolating headphones
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.320]   on.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   It's true.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.320]   And that's true.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   That background noise.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.880]   If you go, if you go to, you know, you go to somewhere like Facebook where they have
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.400]   these giant open offices, half the people that have headphones on and they're like that,
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.480]   try to, you know, hide away from each other.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.320]   Kevin, my friend.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.120]   That's not the normal world.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.080]   No, I think he, I think that is the normal world.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.240]   In fact, you've, have you seen the ads for Beats headphones?
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.760]   They were running during all the football games.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:45.520]   And, and the, what they were selling was that these, that these headphones would to let you
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.360]   tune out the noise.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.800]   There was one with Colin Kaepernick.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.000]   And then I guess in response, they, they made one for Richard Sherman.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.200]   And let me show you, this is a, this is the Beats ad.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.520]   The atmosphere was electric.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.320]   What's it like playing in front of these fans?
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   It's incredible, man.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.320]   I think we have the most outstanding fans in the world.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.120]   Richard, Richard, Richard, you've honed field advantage.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.120]   What's on his head, of course, a pair of.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.120]   It's the same as we have all seasonals.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.120]   Beats headphones.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   You take one game at a time.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.120]   You take one game at a time.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   You take one game at a time.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.120]   I really do.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   I really do.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.800]   Why do you take your trash talk as a distraction to your teammates?
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   It doesn't distract anybody.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   It motivates.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.040]   This is actually a great, timely ad.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.800]   Well, you try to set an example.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   You try to beat himself.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.240]   How do you cut down for us at your secondary place dirty?
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   Well, I'll take exception to that.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   Poor guy.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.800]   Uh, not on.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.440]   This is, this is why headphones are invented.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.960]   Did you fight a lot of the kids?
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.400]   Not everybody in Compton's gang, man.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   Richard, have you gone downhill since college?
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   No.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   I'm an injured athlete.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   Do you feel you're untouchable?
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   I'm not afraid of anything.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   You're reputation as a fuck.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   He's finally heading out.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   I don't have that repurposed.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400]   Richard, you think you are above the law?
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:56.200]   Time to put on the headphones, Richard.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.600]   Put on the headphones.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.760]   He's the quiet weights.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:11.120]   Here's what you want is the new slogan for beats.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.360]   I think that's a direct response because how many of us really are in a locker room peppered
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.520]   by questions from the sports sporting press, but many of us are in offices where people
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.000]   are annoying.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   This is why people wear head.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I like my beat.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   What?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   I can't do it right now.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Why don't I wear beats?
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.400]   I do have Sennheiser 280s.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.040]   I love my headphones.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   35 dBs of noise reduction.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   I see noise reduction.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   These beats are amazing.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   These studios are amazing.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   They're comfortable.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   Really?
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   You like them?
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.040]   Because I always thought they were kind of overpriced.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   They are.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.040]   They are.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   Okay.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   This is what happened.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   Sennheiser 280s.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040]   I can only exchange.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.520]   The only thing I found in the store was that's why I used it as an excuse to get them unhappy
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520]   with them now.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.600]   People headphones that sound good are really a lifesaver.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   I agree.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.440]   You don't you know that's your life.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   And I do not.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.360]   If I get on an airplane without my headphones, I go, "Oh no, please."
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.280]   I mean, it's the worst thing that could happen.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.560]   It's all in a, you know, because that baby behind me, that guy in front of me with his
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.120]   phone and I just want to seal the world out.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.680]   It's right now in New York, the double is your muffs, which we need badly.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   Oh!
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   That's true.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.680]   Hey, Gina?
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   Yes.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.680]   It is cool.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.920]   It's not too late to come back to California, Gina.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.920]   Mmm.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.920]   It's getting...
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.960]   My real estate lawyer, my disagree.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   Are you moved in yet?
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.960]   Not yet.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   Our closing is next week.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.960]   Oh, good luck.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   Thank you.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.200]   These are expensive headphones.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   They look good though.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.720]   I still see I'm still a newbie to the whole open office thing.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.960]   I've got crappy earbuds and they just don't do it.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   No, no, no.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   You need ceiling, ceiling headphones.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   Sennheiser 280s.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   All right.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.880]   That's the pick from Mr. Kevin Marks.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.880]   I personally like...
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.880]   It's Studio.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.400]   Okay, Beats Studio.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   The recommendation from...
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.400]   Sennheiser 2.0.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.600]   I'll tell you what I wear and love...
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.960]   There's an H280, that's the one.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   Yeah, those are nice.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   How much are those?
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   90 bucks?
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   That's not bad.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   They look comfortable.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   They're good.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.960]   Sennheiser makes the studio headphones.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.960]   You can pay like three grand for Sennheiser headphones if you want real studio headphones.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   That's right.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.760]   But these are actually recordest headphones.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.000]   So they've got 35 dB of passive noise cancelling.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   They're just like, "Oh, I'm on."
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.640]   And you're already effectively wearing your protectors.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   I like my classic.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.240]   And they sound good.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.600]   I like my classic cans, the AKG K240 Stair Studio headphones.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.520]   Yeah, no, no, no, no, there's a good two, but they don't cut out as much sound.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.360]   No, they're actually a good choice for people want to hear a little bit because they're
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.360]   ported.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.920]   But if you really want to seal it out, then there's also...
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.520]   These are the Sennheiser H280s.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.560]   And they seal your head like you've got a clamp on it.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.320]   They're the ones.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   Those are my favorite ones.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.760]   We kind of headphone buffs here.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.320]   I think we've got all kinds.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.120]   There's the K240s on chat.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.200]   Most of us tend to wear those because they're comfortable you can wear them all day.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.480]   And they don't really seal out the noise.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   What are these?
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.640]   These are audio technicas?
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.640]   ATHM50s.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.880]   Both Alex and John who are audio files like these.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.240]   They don't come fee enough.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.240]   There's nothing comfier than a K240.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.360]   So this is the fascinating thing for me is that it used to...
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.120]   Like five years ago, headphones like that were something only people who usually professionally
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.120]   wore.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:38.520]   And now they're being advertised in a super bowl by the star athletes because suddenly
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.000]   over the year, Cairns are fashionable again.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.440]   And I think it is this...
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.720]   It is this sense of shared space.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.000]   The tagline of that thing is right.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.360]   It's like you listen to what you want to hear and you want to be...
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.040]   As you said, you're in this open plan office, there's a lot going on and you want to pull
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.040]   yourself away from it.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.760]   And that was the original...
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.760]   It was the original...
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.440]   You know, Cerny Walkman idea of you have your own soundtrack to the world.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.440]   It's kind of interesting that it's back, isn't it?
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.440]   But it's...
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.040]   The other thing I encourage you to think for me is these things actually have good acoustic
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   quality.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   Right.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   So you can...
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:15.960]   There's been this sort of myth of MP3's destroying audio quality in the music industry.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.680]   And actually what's happened is that people have been mixing, balancing things badly.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.680]   Right.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.680]   And then MP3ing them.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.720]   But they said, "Well, everyone's only listening to it, you know, prepped it later, but anyway,
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.840]   you know, we've got to make sure this stuff works."
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   Whereas that's...
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   That's...
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.840]   That's apparently not true anymore.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.120]   Gigantic headphones with audio isolation are mainstream.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.800]   You know, there are four aisles of them in the electronics store compared to like one
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.320]   aisle of TVs now.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.920]   And everyone's walking around wearing them.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:49.040]   So that means that we can go back to good quality audio again and stop mixing everything
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:54.280]   so that it's like compressed for somebody who's got these on and walking and traffic.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.280]   I think also comes...
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.960]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.360]   It has to start with fashion.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.400]   Kids can't wear them unless it's okay to wear them.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.560]   You don't want to be the dork who's wearing headphones.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.800]   And I saw that with my son, Henry, who started wearing lime green headphones about three
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   or four years ago.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   It was clearly had become the fashion.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.280]   And that's because these earbuds are so correct.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.920]   Not only sound bad, but they fall out.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   They're crappy.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.560]   That's what everybody had with their iPod.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.520]   But I also think it came from the commerce side because people realized, "Oh, you know,
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.920]   you could build decent headphones really cheap and sell them for a huge premium if you just
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.560]   attached Dr. Dre's name to it."
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.920]   The markup on the beets and the follow on is amazing, yeah.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.400]   So it's a very, very profitable business as well.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.760]   And that's why when you go to CES, you see aisle after aisle after aisle of headphones.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.320]   It was a great story of the New York Times.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.040]   I think what a year and a half ago about the origin of beets and the company that originally
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.600]   made them and how Dre and company got them out of it.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.680]   And it's been a phenomenal business story.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.560]   See now the wire cutter recommends Bose Quiet Comfort.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.400]   Wire cutter is almost always right.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.920]   In this case, completely wrong.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.920]   Yeah, I've tried them.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.920]   I don't like them.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.160]   No, I'm a, I love wire cutter.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   That's Brian Lamb and company.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.520]   And they do a great job.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.320]   And 99% of the time I completely agree because the goal of this is pick one and that's the
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.720]   one.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.960]   And I'm almost always there right.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.440]   I agree with their TV review.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.320]   But in that case, I cannot, those are not flat headphones.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.800]   They're not accurate headphones.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.280]   They're highly overpriced.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.280]   But Bose is the king.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.840]   Yeah, the Bose is the king of markup on these, on this particular.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.840]   You know where you go is headroom, which is headphone.com.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.200]   They sell all the brands.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.640]   They've been doing it for years and they have a huge variety, but they also have a lot of
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.920]   helpful information so you can pick the headphone that makes sense for you.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   Because it is personal.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:47.040]   And really ideally you'd go and listen before I buy because they all have, they all have
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   some unique.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:54.000]   Oh, Leo in the chat room, there is a press release now.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Thank you.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   It's official.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Yes, it's official.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I am shocked.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.480]   The gadget priest, the gadget priest, just put it up.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   Yep.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   It's investor.google.com.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.800]   It's the latest press release from the Google.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.040]   2.91 billion, including.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.200]   Let's say, say, say.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.160]   In the strong PC business, a fast growing smartphone business, this agreement will significantly
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.960]   strengthen Lenovo's position in the smartphone market.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.160]   They will gain a strong market presence in North America and Latin America, both of which
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:26.960]   of course are Moto X places as well as a foothold in Western Europe where Moto X has
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.800]   just recently added the market.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:36.920]   2.91 billion dollars, including 1.141 billion paid at close, 660 million in cash, 750 million
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.920]   in Lenovo shares.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   That's interesting.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.920]   That means Lenovo.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.560]   Google now has a stake in Lenovo, which I find interesting.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.560]   Lenovo--
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.000]   And then said Promissory Notes.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.480]   Lenovo gets the Motorola Mobility brand, Moto Marla, Moto X Moto G, Droid.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.640]   The Droid is now a Chinese company.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   Wow.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.680]   The Google will maintain ownership of the vast majority of mobile mobility patent portfolio.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.120]   There you go.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.040]   Including current patent applications and invention disclosures is part of its ongoing
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   relationship with Google.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.520]   Lenovo will receive a license to this rich portfolio of patents and other AIP.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.960]   Additionally, Lenovo will receive over 2,000 patent assets as well as the Motorola Mobility
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.080]   brand and trademark portfolio.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   Very interesting.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.600]   Of course, it's subject to regulatory approval.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.840]   So that means the market's going to sell.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840]   What?
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.840]   9 billion on this?
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   They can basically--
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.920]   --and take that off their profits as well.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.320]   So they paid 9 billion dollars for patents.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.920]   Well, that was about the guess.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.120]   That's what I think it was worth.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.280]   And of course, there's more to it than this.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.640]   Who knows what the agreements include, but they may have acquired a very strong partner
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.800]   in Android as well.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.320]   Maybe they've said to Lenovo, OK, but you've got to keep these Google experience.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.320]   We don't know.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.320]   Right.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.200]   Are they more on the Windows phones?
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.000]   They might have kept them out of the Windows market, not that that matters that much.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.880]   It also means that you could, for instance, say from now on the Nexus line is made by Lenovo.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   Period.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.200]   Well, that's the other story that's up is they're getting rid of the Nexus line.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.720]   So they're going to-- is this merely a renaming to Google experience?
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.720]   That's what it's perspective, that's what it says.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.360]   They rename it.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.360]   I don't know what that means.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.920]   That mean-- I mean, Nexus has traditionally meant a pure Google experience.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   Not-- I mean, just--
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.400]   So that apparently becomes play.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.800]   So what's the distinction, though, between an HTC Google experience, a Samsung Galaxy
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.640]   4 Google experience, and a Nexus 5?
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.640]   Here's the distinction.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.640]   Yes.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:54.720]   If they get rid of that, then you have play editions of other brands' phones, but you
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.600]   have no Google brand phone.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   Got it.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.600]   Right.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.200]   If this is true, Google got out of having branded devices.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.200]   Yes.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.040]   So they're not rebranding, right?
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.120]   The Google Play editions, it's already exist, right?
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.120]   Like I'm holding on here.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.120]   So they're dropping Nexus?
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.120]   They're just dropping Nexus.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.120]   Yeah, it's super cheating.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.120]   That'd be the price of being more than a Google Play edition.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.960]   That'd be the price of being far more.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   Me too.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.080]   But they have had a problem in that the Nexus would be the Nexus 6, and that's actually
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.680]   Blade Runner, so.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.160]   They had to stop.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.840]   OK, I got another interesting theory.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.840]   I'm just reading how that one ends.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   It's like, oh, go.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   Where?
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   What is Google most afraid of right now?
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.480]   Samsung, because Samsung is creating an Android device that is divergent from Google
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.840]   in an extreme way.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.360]   Now you were saying that there may be some sort of agreement now between Google and
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   Samsung?
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   It's in the right now.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.360]   Yeah, I put it under Android.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.280]   And there's an agreement.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.200]   There's also an agreement for Samsung and Google to collaborate on patents, existing patents
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.840]   and patents in the next 10 years.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.000]   It's under the fourth one under Android.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.640]   They're united in there.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.760]   If I remember Google just recently dropped the lawsuit.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.200]   Motorola just dropped its Samsung lawsuits, right?
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.360]   So they're really united against Microsoft and Apple.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.360]   These are the natural.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.840]   So recode has the story.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.920]   After Google Pressure, Samsung will dial back Android tweaks and homegrown apps.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.000]   It's not just Google Pressure.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.680]   I think consumers are doing the same thing.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.680]   I think that's the thing.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:29.800]   Yeah, there's a thing, Samsung are realizing that they're losing sales to the Nexus 5,
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.680]   partly on price, but partly on the fact that their apps aren't as good.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:41.800]   And as somebody pointed out, if they're built in an under-litable, it's a dead way on the
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   phone.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:47.400]   And my wife has the Galaxy 4.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.840]   I had my Nexus 5 stolen when I went to replace it.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.800]   It was like, no, I'm getting another Nexus 5, definitely.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.040]   I wouldn't think of buying the Samsung one because of all the weight of those apps and
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.600]   the way it makes-- they're apps aren't bad.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.600]   They're just not quite--
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.600]   Yeah, no, they're bad.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.600]   --as up to the next single one.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   No, they're bad.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.600]   They're just bad.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:15.480]   And the camera app and the slow motion stuff and the things they do in there is fairly good.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.440]   But I've been impressed with the Nexus 5 for that, too.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.600]   Yeah, no.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   They're not as good at the cloud services stuff as Google is because nobody is.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   So that's the--
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.560]   You know, you take this Moto X Lenovo-- I'm going to tell you what to do.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.800]   You take the Moto X, you give it a 1080p screen.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   I don't think you have to make it bigger.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   I think the size is fine.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.000]   And you put a really damn good camera in it.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   8 megapixel, maybe 13 megapixel-- damn.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Maybe-- let's go for it.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.440]   Let's make it a 20 megapixel damn good camera in here.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.960]   And this is a great phone.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.440]   So I'm hopeful.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:56.440]   I'm thinking Lenovo can-- I think Google looked for a partner that could take Motorola
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:01.560]   where Google has been unable to take it, a manufacturing partner, a partner that can
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.320]   make a much better bit of hardware because Google's biggest fear is the 80% market share
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.520]   that Samsung has in Android.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.200]   And they're crapping it up.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.120]   And I think it's very deleterious to Android in general.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.360]   And so I make sense that they would both pursue this by saying Samsung.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   You've got to knock it off.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.160]   Samsung's also hearing for consumers, I'm sure.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.480]   And acquiring-- selling this company to Lenovo and saying, "Here, guys, you've got to make
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.240]   a beautiful Google experience phone to kick Samsung to the curb."
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.240]   But you know what?
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.800]   It's going to be an expensive phone.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.920]   Google used this opportunity to try to drop the prices down and pressure the entire industry
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.920]   on cost.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.080]   And now that's gone.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.880]   And that's why the Nexus being gone depresses me so much because the only reason they did
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.920]   it on Motorola was because they owned it.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.520]   And they had a business reason to do that.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.000]   They want to spread Android.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.400]   Nexus, they want to show an example of a great phone at a low price.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.560]   Now Google doesn't have to--
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   Here's the statement.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.960]   Larry Page has just made a statement.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.000]   We've signed an agreement to sell Motorola to Lenovo.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.040]   This is an important move for Android users everywhere.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.680]   I want to explain why in detail.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:15.400]   We acquired Motorola in 2012 to help supercharge the Android ecosystem by creating a stronger
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.760]   patent portfolio for Google and great smartphones for our users.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.280]   Over the past 19 months, Dennis Woodside and the team have done a tremendous job reinventing
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.440]   the company.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.960]   They focused on building a smaller number of great and great value smartphones.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.320]   Both the Moto G and Moto X are doing really well and very excited about the smartphone
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.600]   lineup for 2014.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.680]   On the intellectual property side, Motorola's patents have helped create a level playing
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.280]   field, which is good news for all Android users and partners.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.680]   So he's declared victory.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.120]   But he says, "The smartphone market is super competitive.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:53.440]   And to thrive, it helps to be all in when it comes to making mobile devices.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.880]   It's why we believe Motorola will be better served by Lenovo, which has a rapidly growing
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:03.240]   smartphone business and is the largest and fastest growing PC manufacturer in the world."
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.360]   This is good for Lenovo, I have to say.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.880]   This move will enable Google to devote our energy to driving innovation across the Android
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.000]   ecosystem for the benefit of smartphone users everywhere.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.520]   In other words, this will help us not piss off the other OEMs.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.240]   As a side note, this does not signal a larger shift for our other hardware efforts to your
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.240]   point, Jeff.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.240]   God, Nest.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:28.080]   The dynamics and maturity of the wearable and home markets, Glass and Nest.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.320]   Glass and Nest, yeah.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.680]   For example, are very different from that of the mobile industry.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.120]   We're excited by the opportunities to build amazing new products for users within these
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   emerging ecosystems.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.320]   In other words, we're not getting out of hardware, we're not getting out of consumer,
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:43.160]   we just don't have the resources to devote to phone.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.160]   Phones are a sucky business.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.600]   Matt Howie has a great tweet.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.760]   I've owned pizzas longer than Google owned Motorola.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:54.960]   Lenovo has the expertise and track record to scale Motorola into a major player within
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.200]   the Android ecosystem.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.000]   This is, I think, directly in response to Samsung's dominance.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.480]   They have a lot of experience in hardware and they have a global reach.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:07.400]   In addition, Lenovo intends to keep Motorola's distinct brand identity just as they did when
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.080]   they acquired ThinkPad from IBM in 2005.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.320]   They did a very good job of that.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.920]   Google will retain the vast majority of Motorola patents, which we will continue to use to
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.400]   defend the entire Android ecosystem.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.440]   The deal has yet to be approved in the US or China and this usually takes time.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:25.640]   So until then, it's business as usual.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.800]   Phenominally impressed with everything the Motorola team has achieved and confident that
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.440]   with Lenovo as a partner, Motorola will build more and more great products for people everywhere.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.440]   Larry Page.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:39.520]   So that is very addressed directly some of the obvious concerns.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:45.720]   Also, Ina Freed points out that Google got $2.3 billion for the set top business.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.200]   Ah, that's right.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   So take that off the phone.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.120]   They didn't lose all that much.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   I think this might not be a bad deal.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.400]   Tax losses, Kevin says, "A tax loss is a beautiful thing for Google."
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.480]   They may actually be able to stop sending all their money through London now.
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.440]   Send it through China.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.880]   All right.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.400]   So wow, big huge story.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.240]   Jason Hells watching with interest course all about Android last night.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.640]   But this changes the landscape for next episode.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.560]   Always the big news brings the next day.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.560]   The next day.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   They did it just for us.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.560]   Wow.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.560]   That's...
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.680]   It dovetails with the news or the rumors about the discontinuity in relation to the Nexus
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.680]   line.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.280]   Obviously, Google doesn't want to be in the business of making phones or tablets.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.280]   Yep.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   Very clear, right?
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   They want to be in the early.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.680]   They want to be in wearables and home because it's not a competitive mature market yet,
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.680]   but phones is.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   They don't want to...
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.320]   Do you think this was the plan all along?
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.600]   I wouldn't think so.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.600]   I think they're more improvisational than that.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.840]   I think they'd say, "Yes, we will buy this and keep it for three years and send it to
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.840]   somebody else."
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.840]   No, I'm going to go right around.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.160]   No, I think what the hell let's buy it.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   Let's get the patents.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.800]   We could turn around right away and sell it.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.960]   No, let's use a period of time to demonstrate to the industry what phones can be.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.880]   Moto X is that, "Okay, goodbye."
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.440]   I think you're right in the question, Leo.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.320]   You know, I tell you, what it does say to me is that Larry Page is a hell of a chess
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.440]   player, whether he is planned this or improvised this.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.240]   This is a very interesting strategic move that makes a lot of sense as he's just...
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.280]   I'm still depressed.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.040]   I like my Nexus 7.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.360]   I like my Nexus 5.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.400]   I like my Chromebook Pixel.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.040]   I like what they were doing.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.040]   Oh, but...
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.280]   I'm fairly sure that Leo can make a Chromebook.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.520]   Lenovo does make a Chromebook.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.920]   They do where they are.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.920]   They're going to.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   They're going to be conventional ones.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.920]   They're going to be commercial ones.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.480]   I'm saying they could probably make a high-end one too.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.160]   Well, that's part of the deal probably too because that was the CES announcement from Lenovo
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.880]   where they're going to do multiple Chromebooks.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.800]   And by the way, they said they're out of the phone business, not out of the Chromebook
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   business.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   Yes.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.440]   Although, I don't know what Google's play in the...
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:08.120]   I can no longer say that I live La Vida Google.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:12.200]   You could say I live La Vida Chrome OS or Android.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   But it makes sense.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.160]   Google doesn't need to be in the business.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:19.240]   They need to foster the business and let many companies get involved.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.080]   I think this isn't a bad thing at all.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.440]   It helps to be all in.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.200]   That's what they're saying, isn't it?
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   That's what they're saying.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   We were not all in.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:35.360]   They didn't want to invest the time and the resources to make Motorola competitive.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   We shall return.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.520]   There's more to talk about including our change log in just a bit.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.840]   Gina Trappani is here from Think Up.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.840]   How's it going?
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.840]   Going well?
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.840]   Going well.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   Good.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.560]   LovemyThinkUp.com soon to be open to all.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.040]   Yes.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.600]   Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York and the author of Public Parts.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.160]   Gutenberg the Geek is free today.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.160]   Thanks to his students.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.160]   Is it a new semester?
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.160]   It's only 99 cents, folks.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.160]   I mean, you're saving a book.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.160]   The US.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   Is it a new semester beginning?
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.160]   Is that what's going on?
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   Yes, it is.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.160]   That's why I'm talking about my students reading.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.080]   New semester.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.440]   And you know, this is good because most people assume that professors assign their own books
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.040]   to make a little money.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.040]   So Jeff's proofing...
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.040]   I do.
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.040]   Not Jeff Jarvis.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.040]   He gives it away.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.480]   I plug them a lot, but I don't assign them.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   Yep.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.480]   Okay.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.160]   Also, Mr. Kevin Marks.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.960]   Oh, he's a great pleasure to have Kevin in his garden.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.160]   Is it raining down there?
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.360]   No, it's not.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.360]   It's dry down there.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.360]   It will be.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.160]   We're having rain up here.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.040]   It has been raining up there.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.240]   We need it.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.680]   You always need it.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.960]   It's been a very dry winter.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.080]   You know, I must say this just to make Jeff and Gina feel bad.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.880]   It was in the 80s here last week.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.240]   Oh, shut up.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.880]   And what we were complaining because we need the rain.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   It's so warm.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.960]   Gosh, I wish it would rain.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.960]   I can't eat it.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   There's the rain.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.960]   There it is.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.960]   Come in your way.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.160]   No, I know the reason it's raining is that because my son took the car to the car wash
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.080]   yesterday, so that's a guarantee to make it rain.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.800]   So did Chad, apparently.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.400]   Yesterday I got my car washed yesterday.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   Yes, today.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:22.560]   The car wash over here has a thing that says, guaranteed free wash if it rains.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.320]   Wait, which one?
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.760]   Rain tree over here.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.160]   Oh, I don't use that one.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.640]   They'll give you a free wash if it rains.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.880]   I think it has to rain within a few days, obviously.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.560]   Our show today brought to you by personal capital.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.200]   With personal capital, you'll finally have your entire financial life in one place on
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:44.600]   your computer, on your tablet, on your phone so you can see in very clear graphs a dashboard
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   of how everything's going.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.680]   There really is two problems in life with how people manage their money.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.720]   First, it's hard to keep track of.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.440]   You come to the end of the month and go, "Where did it all go?
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   What happened?"
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.840]   You've got 401Ks, you've got bank accounts, charge cards, mortgages, loans, everything's
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.840]   on different sites.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.960]   It's not consolidated in one place.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.000]   And then if you're lucky enough to have some to invest, you'll be either paying some
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.600]   of it in management or paying fees to brokerage.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.080]   And there's ways to do it more efficiently.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.960]   Let's put the power of the cloud to workforce here with personal capital.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.720]   You'll see your whole net worth, how every asset's performing.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.640]   No data entry, you just give them the account information.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.040]   It's all as collated, put together in a clean, color-coded graphs.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.280]   It shows you if you are paying money managers, how much your fees are adding up to, how they're
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.320]   impacting your profit, how you can reduce those fees.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.080]   You can get specific advice on your investment strategy so you can balance your portfolio.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.400]   It's very different when you're young than as you approach retirement age.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.760]   It's really important that you rebalance kind of continuously, but it's a very hard
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.160]   thing to do.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   I'm a big fan of this idea of rebalancing your portfolio at least quarterly, but man,
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:00.760]   I never do it because it makes it easy.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.320]   The best part is absolutely free.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.240]   It's not going to cost you a penny.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.400]   Personal capital, a smart way to make your money grow quicker.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.200]   That's why they've been featured in Time, Forbes, Bloomberg, and more.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.920]   You could set up a free account today as we speak.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.880]   Go to personalcapital.com/twig.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   Getting set up takes a minute.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:23.440]   It's free, but you've got to go to personalcapital.com/twig.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.800]   We do thanks to Personal Capital so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.480]   I started using them a year ago when we interviewed, it's not at Harris, Tim Harris, the founder
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:38.840]   of Personal Capital who was a former CEO at PayPal and Intuit and learned a lot about
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.120]   how this all works.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.040]   There it is, Bill Harris.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.480]   We interviewed him on triangulation a year ago.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.640]   He told me I'm starting this thing, Personal Capital, I signed up then and I love it.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:54.000]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.120]   I think it's time to break out the horns.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.120]   Time for another Google change log.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:05.120]   Here we go for your gather.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.200]   The Google change log.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trappani with the latest from the Google.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.960]   Lego lovers, this one's for you.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:14.960]   Buildwithchrome.com.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:21.480]   This is a site that Google graduated from a Chrome experiment to an actual public website
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.520]   to help you do a Lego movie.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.240]   Yeah, have you seen this?
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.200]   No, this is so cool.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.200]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.640]   The site uses WebGL 3D graphics.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:36.360]   Let users build any virtual Lego creation they want using virtual Lego blocks.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.600]   Very slick web based interface.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.160]   You drag the blocks onto the -- you choose your color block.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.400]   Of course, it's too complicated for me.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.680]   I can't figure it out.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.680]   Where's your --
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.480]   Why do I have a map?
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.480]   What is this map?
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   I don't understand.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:53.840]   You have to kind of play around with it a little -- now it should have shown -- it should
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.200]   be showing you the base, your Lego base, but it doesn't seem to be --
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   In Chrome, left click place brick, right click remove brick, space and drag, rotate brick.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.200]   Oh.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:14.240]   You can add bricks of different sizes and kinds and connect them just like regular Legos.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.960]   Once you've made something, you sign in with Google+ so you can share your creation.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.920]   You can look at stuff that other people have built on the site as well.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.920]   There's an explore option.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.840]   You first go to it, buildwithchrome.com.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.360]   This is all the bricks I ever wanted.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.440]   Prepare to lose many hours.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.920]   This is fun.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.640]   My mind's not working well though.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.640]   There's -- there you go.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.280]   Chad, how come yours is working so well?
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.280]   There you go, Chad.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   You got it.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.280]   Chad's smarter.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.280]   Chad's smarter than I am.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.880]   Maybe if I sign in with my Google+, know you're basically a loud Google.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.880]   Okay.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.680]   I'm going to send in some of these two words.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.040]   It's a really nice smooth interface.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.040]   I'm getting dizzy.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.120]   Chad's really good with Lego.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.120]   Mine's broke.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.120]   I used to use.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.120]   I blame Minecraft.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.120]   Yes, it is very Minecraft.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.120]   It is pretty Minecraft.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.520]   I think they struck me about it.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.800]   No wonder Chad's so good at it.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   Needo.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.600]   All right.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.600]   Buildwithchrome.com.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   Buildwithchrome.com.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.840]   There's not that satisfying click.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.840]   Oh, there is.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   Oh, there is?
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:24.960]   Can you hear the click?
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   It goes -- Oh.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.960]   Oh, neat.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.240]   Now, I don't know how to trash here.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.960]   Let me remove bricks.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.960]   Whoa.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.360]   It is like Minecraft and they just kind of float there.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.800]   You cannot -- it's a little bit too.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   Wow.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:46.120]   There's also a build academy so you can train to become a master builder.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.120]   That's good.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.200]   So this actually -- master the -- okay.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.200]   So do the academy.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.200]   Chad, show this.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.200]   This is nice.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.200]   This is the academy.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.320]   Shows you how to get started.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:59.520]   And then every build begins with a base plate which you can rotate.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.520]   Try it on your own.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.720]   And then -- Oh, this is neat.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.440]   I think it features characters in the movie as well.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.000]   Oh, it's a little -- it's a movie.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   It is a little bit.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Yeah, it's for the movie.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   It's for the movie.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   It's for the movie.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Sorry.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Who's not excited about the movie?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   I don't know.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   I mean, who doesn't want to build with virtual Legos?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Oh, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.560]   It's a Lego movie.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.960]   There's always a Lego movie.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.920]   The Lego is taught.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   So, okay.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:34.600]   I know we want to keep building Lego, but I'll -- I should move it along.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   Google's got a new class now.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   Oh.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   Class.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:45.440]   Google's got a new one box search result answer.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.280]   Is it as the crow flies distance calculation.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   So if you want another distance between two places, even places that you can't fly or
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.480]   drive, you can just enter the query into the box.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   So if you say, "How far is it from Petaluma to Brooklyn?"
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.720]   Or, "How far is it from Brooklyn to Hawaii?"
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:07.200]   Google will display the distance in -- as the crow flies distance in one box result.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.080]   So it's just kind of a fun -- could be a really fun party game as well.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.280]   How far do you think it is from Hawaii?
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.960]   I do this all the time with maps, but it's so painful.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.960]   This is great.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:18.960]   This is great.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:23.200]   And another little tweak to Google search results.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.000]   Google search pages now show the name of the site next to the URL.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.920]   And if it's a well-known name, it's a well-known site that they have knowledge, graph, information
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   about.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.120]   You'll see a small card with that information into it in it.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:41.960]   So you Google search Twit, for example, or YouTube, and the example Chad showing us.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   There's a little drop down, a little kind of knowledge graph card that shows up and tells
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   you what the entity is, who it's owned by, and any other sort of knowledge graph facts
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.960]   included there.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.440]   So I search for Twit.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.800]   There was a little card there for that.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.160]   There was one for Life Hacker.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:03.000]   There's not one for Think Up Yet because we haven't reached our relevancy yet, but we're
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   working on it.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.360]   But yeah, see, it says owned by Leo LaPorte, which I guess links to your Google+ profile,
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.360]   I imagine.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:10.360]   Or Wikipedia.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.360]   That's a Wikipedia entry.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.360]   Yeah, it's a Wikipedia entry.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.360]   It's not a Wikipedia.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   Unless you sign it speak to Wikipedia.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.360]   Okay.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.360]   That's really neat.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.240]   It's very up to date, too.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.240]   Cool.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:29.600]   And finally, Google announced new designer frames for Glass.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:36.960]   So if you've already spent the $1500 on Glass, you can now spend another $225 to get new custom
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.880]   frames that have been designed in-house by Google.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:45.840]   They're much more normal looking glasses than the visor-like version.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.560]   And Google also partnered with one of the largest--
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.560]   True.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.440]   I lost-- sorry.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.960]   I lost the insurance companies--
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.960]   VPS.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.960]   VPS is the insurance company.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   Yes.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:51:59.960]   Thank you.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.960]   Vision insurance providers.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.680]   And we'll cover Glass and get you prescription frames.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   Okay.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.960]   So yeah, these frames are nice.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:09.740]   They still don't make-
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:10.580]   - They've done it with the door,
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.060]   keep putting it over.
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.140]   So, two problems I have.
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.980]   One, they don't make clear,
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.260]   'cause I'm about to send in my old class
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:22.380]   on the exchange program that they have.
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.640]   First question,
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.080]   these work with glass property,
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.680]   you're not getting a different glass, right?
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.300]   - Right, actually, you can actually remove the glass
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.440]   apart from your current glass
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.340]   and snap them onto the new frames.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.180]   - Okay, cool.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.440]   - They only work if the electronics are snapped on,
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.080]   and apparently it's very smooth and easy transition
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.800]   and just snaps on and works.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.040]   - Yeah, what do you mean it only works
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.600]   that they're snapped on?
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.720]   - I believe that the new frames are designed
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.280]   for glass specifically,
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.000]   so I'm not sure exactly how this works,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.040]   but I don't think that the frames will stay on your head
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.360]   if glass isn't attached to them.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.200]   - Oh, I see.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   - They are glass.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.300]   - So, you can't just take the glass off your glasses
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.760]   when you go into the movie, but we don't want to go there again.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.520]   - That would be a nice feature, though.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.300]   - I can't you just unsnap it.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.180]   - Oh, the reaction to that last week,
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.580]   I mean, it was so polarized.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.460]   Some said that I was being a horrible jerk,
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.500]   some said that you were being a horrible jerk.
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.060]   It was amazing.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:17.900]   - Yeah.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.260]   - But everybody loves Gina.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.860]   Everybody said poor Gina.
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.460]   (laughing)
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.420]   - It's new, but I realized coming out of the conversation,
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:26.940]   I really didn't say what I thought,
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.100]   because I really, I could see both of your points of view,
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.100]   but in the end, just to make sure that everyone,
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.060]   I was with Jeff in the end.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.580]   (cheering)
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.960]   - I was with Jeff in that, I felt like,
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.600]   although I would, if I was in a locker room,
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.040]   it's not quite the same in women's bathrooms,
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.740]   but if I was in a gym locker room,
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:45.880]   I would put the glasses on top of my head at the same time.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.440]   But I did get with your point of, you know,
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.920]   not assuming the worst, but I didn't want to open
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.020]   that can of worms again.
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.700]   I just wanted to knock my phone in.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.020]   - I hear about my feelings.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.260]   - The wheels get ready to shoot.
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.640]   All right, here's my other question.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.420]   I swear, since Gina, you have glass too,
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.420]   I, then they say, oh, go buy them now.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.100]   - I, I read, there's a problem in the form.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.180]   Every time I am, many other people went to try to buy them,
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.580]   it says, hey, become an explorer.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.220]   - No, I am a freaking explorer.
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:11.500]   Let me buy them frames.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.260]   I can't figure out how to buy them.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.940]   - Is that a multiple account sign in thing?
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.780]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.860]   I now have my glass transferred to Buzz machine,
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.140]   to my apps account.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:21.340]   - Oh, you do, okay.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.220]   - Yeah, I transferred it.
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:23.700]   - But when you become an explorer,
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.460]   they like whitelist your account.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.380]   So they may have whitlisted your Gmail account.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.900]   So try logging in, try seeing if you're signed in
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:31.900]   as your other account.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.340]   Maybe it's some weirdness around that.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.180]   - Oh, Google.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.700]   (laughing)
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.620]   Yeah, so when I went to go pick up glass,
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.980]   they like manually added me to some sort of whitelist.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.060]   They asked me for my Gmail address and did it.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.620]   So that might have been the issue.
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.060]   If it says that you're, should become a explorer.
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.180]   - Look at the, okay, just be a favor here, folks.
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.820]   Look at the four frames, which one should I buy?
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.220]   - There's four frames, I thought there was just one.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.660]   So they're all titanium.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.500]   - They're four.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.340]   - They're all titanium.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.260]   - They're light.
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.820]   - I like titanium frames.
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.060]   And how much are they?
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:03.980]   They're 100?
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.140]   - 225, I think, right?
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.900]   - 225 on top of the 1500.
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:07.740]   - That's not bad.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.260]   - Plus the lens you then have to buy to fit into it.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.500]   - Now there are companies I've seen here who sell
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.780]   Optics Planet sells--
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:14.700]   - Rochester.
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.980]   - Also-- - Adapters for Google Glass
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:22.060]   so that you could then attach them to prescription glasses.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.580]   - That's thin, which isn't as thin as split.
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:25.900]   That's bold.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.780]   - Oh, that's your look right there.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:29.620]   - Oh.
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.380]   - Can you get your lips to look like that too?
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.300]   - I think it's so cute.
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.220]   - How can they all have puffy lips?
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:37.820]   I guess they're all young.
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.580]   - 'Cause that one's the one thing.
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.140]   - Glass gives you nice lips.
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.700]   - Yeah, this one?
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.540]   - Yeah.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.180]   - 'Cause put just, Jeff, tilt your face down a little bit.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.300]   Perce your lips.
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.820]   Could grow your, I know your beard's good.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.460]   You're ready with the beard.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:54.180]   - Very good.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.540]   - That's not a good look.
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:56.540]   (laughing)
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:57.620]   - That was over his nose.
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.460]   Look, we're on now.
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.620]   - Yeah, you gotta match it all up.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:00.460]   There you go.
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.660]   - Here, outside.
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:03.500]   - I don't know.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:04.300]   It looks like John Boehner.
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.700]   I don't, it's not working.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.820]   (laughing)
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.060]   - If I look like John Boehner, it's like this.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:12.100]   - Boehner was darker than Obama.
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.020]   That was the weirdest thing.
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.380]   Has he been in the tanning booth?
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:15.500]   What's going on with him?
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:16.780]   - The prize and tans, yeah.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.620]   - Yeah.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:20.460]   And then of course, the whitest man in the world
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.860]   is our vice president.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:26.740]   I mean, oh, this is better.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:27.580]   This is better.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.420]   - Yeah, that's better.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:29.260]   - Yeah, smile, Jeff.
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.060]   Don't look so, yeah.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.620]   - Yeah, I think those are for you.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.660]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:35.500]   - Oh, this is pretty good.
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.660]   - That's a good look.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.980]   - Baby.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.220]   (laughing)
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:41.700]   (laughing)
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.780]   - Turn your head a little bit to the left, Jeff.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:45.540]   - No, the other way, yeah.
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.780]   (laughing)
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.820]   - There you go.
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.140]   No, when he smiles, it works.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:52.980]   It's good.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:53.820]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:55.020]   - Screenshot's a comment.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:56.460]   (laughing)
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.620]   - They needed Android app that has you try
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.740]   on the frames on your face.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.380]   - Yeah, it doesn't Warby Parker do that.
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:04.060]   They, that was the rumor they were gonna do a deal
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:05.500]   with Warby, they should have.
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.340]   - Ah.
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:11.740]   - I think that's your look right there, Jeff.
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.420]   That's kind of the,
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:16.500]   that's kind of the horn rim professorial.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.220]   - The glass hardware is still too big.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.580]   Like it still looks,
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:20.420]   I said this on all of it,
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.420]   and Android last night still looks too cyborgate.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:23.260]   (laughing)
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.780]   Still better than the visor, but still.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.380]   - Well, that's all I got.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.940]   - And that's the Google change log.
[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.700]   (dramatic music)
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.500]   - Does it mean if they're doing frames
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.820]   that there are, that it is imminent
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.460]   that they're gonna make a less a consumer product?
[00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:41.820]   - Seems like they would.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:42.900]   - Seems like they would.
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:45.980]   - I mean, I think so.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.060]   They've been pushing updates.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.580]   They're, they're, I mean, it's,
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:52.340]   it's not like, you know, nothing has changed with it
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:53.180]   for a while.
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:54.660]   I think that they're, you know,
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.100]   they're doing frames, they've been pushing out updates.
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.660]   I think that they're committed to glass for,
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:02.340]   committed to the consumer release.
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:04.220]   And I bet it would be this year.
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.500]   - You just saw it, Larry Page,
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.620]   in his statement on the Motorola acquisition
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.020]   mentioned specifically, wearables.
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.060]   He didn't say glass, he said wearables.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:15.900]   - Right, in Sergei's the glass guy, right?
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.740]   So. - Right, right.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:22.340]   Gmail goes down for 50 minutes, the world reels.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:24.820]   (laughs)
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:25.660]   - Well, maybe not.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:28.220]   - Over half of our think up subscribers use Gmail.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.980]   It's amazing that, you know, how many people use it
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.420]   and how it really can throw,
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:37.380]   it really can throw off things when it's down.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.820]   I mean, it's just never down.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:44.740]   But yeah, 50 minutes without the, without the drip.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:48.220]   - I didn't notice, but I must just been at a time
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.740]   when I wasn't paying any attention.
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.660]   YouTube comments didn't work, Google+ didn't work.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:58.140]   - It wasn't just Gmail, I think it was the,
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.980]   the user graph thing that went down, which is scary.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.340]   - Well, that's, okay, so that's kind of interesting.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:06.460]   So there is a tool, there is a service
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.580]   that Gmail+ both use.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:13.420]   - Yeah, I mean, it was, it's the old,
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.420]   it was the contact thing from Gmail.
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:16.940]   And then, well, while I was there,
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:18.460]   it got made into this centralized service
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:21.180]   that everyone could use, every Google product could use.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.660]   And that's partly what,
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.100]   and that's what all these new,
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:25.340]   plus and everything else is built on top of it.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.660]   - So it wasn't IMAP or POP that went down.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:31.100]   It was this identity service, basically.
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.540]   - Yes, 'cause that,
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:37.980]   I'm trying to, I'll not say internal code names.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:40.020]   So that basically, there's an internal service
[00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:44.220]   that is all the profile information.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.300]   And it was migrated from being your contact details
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.540]   inside your individual Gmail thing,
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.980]   which was shined at over lots of servers
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:55.660]   to being a very, very large database of all the,
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:58.780]   everyone's contacts and everyone's personal profile.
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.060]   And that was then used as the backbone
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.620]   for booting out all these other services.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.380]   - So that would, for instance,
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.300]   if that's the case, then you would have seen
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.020]   Google Connect go down as well,
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.340]   or whatever Google calls it, the login,
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.580]   the centralized login.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.420]   Charram, did you--
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.740]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.500]   The login is separate from that.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.340]   - Okay.
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.260]   - I don't think that went down.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.100]   - Okay.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.940]   - That thing has been saying uptime.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.020]   That has had a half of them sent uptime
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.140]   for something like nine years.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:23.980]   - Oh, okay.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.620]   - 'Cause they really, that is locked down
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:27.460]   like anything else.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.220]   But I think it was the actual,
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.500]   the profile information stuff
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.740]   and the ability to pull information about people.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.540]   That seemed to be the bit that was down.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.340]   And that would, and because that's heavily called
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.900]   by these other services, they lost it as well.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:44.900]   - Here's the picture of Larry Page with Yang Yuan Ching,
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.920]   the chairman and CEO of Lenovo.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.960]   Apparently in a mountain view right now
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.400]   to a seal net deal.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:56.560]   This is the picture that Google released
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.520]   with the announcement.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:04.320]   We're giving you this giant robot.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.320]   (laughing)
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.000]   - It looks like he just bought a used robot.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.840]   I am sorry, but it does.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.240]   - It's a Trojan horse.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.200]   It gets there and little Google cars come out of it.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.840]   - It's the Chinese regulators.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.920]   Don't approve this deal.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.760]   It will be this picture that did it.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.280]   I want to ask interesting question, by the way.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.800]   Does this affect the relationship of Google
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.520]   to the Chinese government anyway?
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.360]   - Wow.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:35.240]   - That's vegetable-coppigated.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:39.720]   - So that's news that nobody,
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.040]   I don't think anybody had that news.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.080]   And it's very interesting, Kevin Marks,
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.520]   but because of your internal knowledge
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.280]   of how this is all wired.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   - Well, they haven't seen a,
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.040]   you know, a post-mortem money, yeah.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:52.880]   They'd take when they--
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.720]   - I haven't either.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.800]   - They nobody write a post-mortem post.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.400]   I haven't seen one, but I may have just missed it.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.760]   - Charles Arthur, the Guardian, just put this up.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.080]   Google's original valuation for Motorola Mobility.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.440]   2.9 billion cash,
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.280]   5.5 billion patents,
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.680]   730 million customer relationships,
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.040]   2.6 billion goodwill,
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.200]   670 million net assets.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.160]   And then I guess that's plus the,
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.960]   I would guess that's separate from the set top business.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.120]   - So they're keeping the goodwill,
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.080]   but they're selling the phones.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.640]   Interesting.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.960]   - Well, you know, as you say,
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.040]   you can write down the goodwill when you feel like it.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:33.920]   - Right.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.680]   - So that means that you can take it as a loss
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.320]   when you want to adjust your balance sheet.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.160]   That's--
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.880]   - New patent for Google Glass.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.760]   This is a newer design.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:46.480]   It's just appeared at the US patent and trademark office.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.160]   Or does it look different?
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.040]   It says it looks different,
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:52.880]   but that looks kind of,
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.320]   I don't know, you're the guys at the glasses.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.160]   Does this--
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.360]   - Are those actual earphones?
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.120]   As opposed to bone connection things?
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120]   - Yeah, well that we knew.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.760]   That was the new version of Google Glass,
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.960]   right, had headphones.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.640]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.640]   - Yeah.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.280]   - Not that much attention.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.440]   - But what this, yeah, so both sides.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.960]   - So that's what's new.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.240]   - This piece of hardware on the front
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.120]   doesn't extend back as far as the current one does.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.000]   - Okay.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.200]   - So they're lessening the hardware.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.800]   Unfortunately, they're lessening the hardware--
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.640]   - This part here.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.640]   - Back of your ear, which you don't care about, right?
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.080]   You care about what's on your head.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.160]   - Well, this was all battery back here, right?
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.760]   - Yeah, this was battery, right, it was battery.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.400]   - This was just a part of how it kind of balanced, wasn't it?
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.120]   To stop it falling off.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.320]   You go to the way back here to stop it falling off the front.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.840]   - So your earphones here, come here,
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.120]   bring your Google Glass over.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.720]   So Erwin, I saw you had a USB connector.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.280]   Is that to keep it charged?
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.800]   So this new design eliminates
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.080]   this whole temple piece back here.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.840]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.880]   But that's the battery, isn't it?
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.640]   And the, oh, that's the bone conductor though too, yeah.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.560]   Erwin's visiting from Hong Kong.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.520]   - Right, so that's why this has the--
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.240]   - How long have you had your Google Glass?
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.400]   Since November.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.440]   And you wear it all the time?
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.160]   You're wearing it over prescription glasses.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.640]   Are you gonna get the new--
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.040]   - I don't wear it when I drive.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.320]   - He says he doesn't wear it when he drives.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.120]   Certainly not in California.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.600]   You never wanna get stopped.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.720]   The other thing is it's no longer over your right eyebrow,
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.960]   unless this is a reversed image,
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.200]   it's over your left eyebrow.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.640]   - Yeah, that's confusing.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.400]   - You know, the problem with all of these also
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.440]   is you can't fold them like glasses.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.280]   Put them in a pocket.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.240]   - Right.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.520]   There's no easy way to--
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.360]   - So thus for 'em.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.920]   - But if I go to the movie,
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.880]   it would be difficult for me to take them off,
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.760]   because I couldn't fold them.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.200]   - Wait, but these new frame designs--
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.440]   - No, they're foldable, right?
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.360]   - You could put the one with those little glasses
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.560]   chain hanging around your neck, right?
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.960]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.280]   - I'm not doing that.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.200]   I'm not doing that.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.280]   - Oh, come on.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.960]   You're gonna do it with your readers any day now,
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.760]   so you might as well just do it with your glass.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.200]   (laughing)
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.400]   - Ooh, there's a thing there.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.040]   There's a jewelry opportunity, yes.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.400]   - Yes.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.720]   - A lawn yet, a Google lawn yet.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.520]   I'm waiting for the Google Monocle.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.320]   - To go back to the Gmail,
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.920]   or not the Gmail outage,
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.800]   well, the people graph outage.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.920]   First, the Google SRE Site Reliability Engineers
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.600]   were doing an AMA and asked me anything on Reddit
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.120]   at the time that the downage happened.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.560]   - Interesting, that's part of the problem, yep.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.720]   - And then Yahoo, on their official Twitter account,
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.120]   tweeted that Gmail was down,
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.720]   and then later deleted the tweet and issued a anthropology
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.520]   saying that they shouldn't have--
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.320]   - Which was their mistake.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.320]   - That was the mistake because it was just a new,
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.800]   they didn't snark, they just said it's down.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.920]   That's a new story, the mistake was the apology.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.760]   - Oh, you're not the apology.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.880]   - 'Cause it was a news feed,
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.280]   and Gmail being down was a story of--
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.600]   - That's a news story, it's not a snark.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.320]   For them to apologize is to emit something
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.040]   that did not happen,
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.560]   and to raise questions about why it happened.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.400]   - Yeah.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.240]   - But who knows?
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.560]   - So it said at 10.55 a.m., this is the official post,
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:04.080]   an internal system that generates configurations,
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.520]   information that tells other systems
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.520]   how to behave in Canada's software bug,
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.480]   and generated an incorrect configuration.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.480]   It was sent to live services over the next 15 minutes,
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.360]   causing user requests for their data to be ignored,
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.560]   and these services in turn generated errors, wow.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.800]   Wow.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.640]   - It gives you a glimpse at how complex this machine is, right?
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.080]   - Wow, yeah.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.760]   - So the code that writes code wrote the wrong code,
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:34.920]   which then pushed code and caused other code to respond,
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.280]   and it feels like with a failure.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.640]   - Get this, engineers, this is all from the Google official blog.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.040]   Engineers were still debugging 12 minutes later,
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.240]   when the same system, having automatically cleared
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.440]   the original error,
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.640]   generated a new correct configuration,
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.840]   20 minutes later, 11.14 a.m., and began sending it,
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.120]   errors, in other words, it's self corrected.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:56.960]   - Wow.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.080]   - Errors subsided rapidly,
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.560]   starting at this time by 11.30,
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.400]   the correct configuration was everywhere,
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.760]   all user services restored.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.360]   In other words, they say this happened automatically
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.440]   and was fixed.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.720]   I think this is very interesting.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.280]   - That's really interesting.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.120]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.240]   - Well, the challenge with, you know,
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.720]   if somebody calls an out of Google,
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.520]   it has to be some kind of cascading failure,
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.840]   'cause they have enough redundancy
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.120]   that any given thing will not cause a failure,
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.680]   but it's when something chains to some other systems
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.760]   and to other systems, that's when things go horribly bad.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.600]   And the big ones that we've seen,
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.720]   they've always had something like that happening,
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.840]   where something causes something else to happen,
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.680]   'cause something else to happen,
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.840]   and therefore, they're blocking each other.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.440]   And it's just similar when Amazon goes down.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.880]   And what happens over time is they find these new
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.840]   failure modes of own ways to protect against them.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.160]   It's interesting that they've got an automatic system
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.800]   that protects things generically.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.080]   - Yeah.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.040]   - That did affect, according to this blog,
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.000]   it's by Ben Trainer of VP Engineering.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.240]   This blog post says,
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.920]   "Gmail Google+ calendar and documents were all affected."
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.680]   But for about 25 minutes for 10% of users,
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.200]   it persisted for as much as 30 minutes longer.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.120]   - And then, yeah, it did.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.240]   - So that's a minor. - So YouTube was affected.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.200]   - Pardon me?
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.280]   - It doesn't say YouTube was affected,
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.560]   I don't know if there's no other.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.000]   - Gmail, Google+ calendar and documents.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.160]   - The comments on YouTube,
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.400]   because now those are done by Google+.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.680]   - Yeah, 'cause those are done through class, yeah.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.520]   - Right.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.640]   I guess that's not considered a separate service.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.280]   There's actually another bug that's kind of a more
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.120]   significant bug.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.280]   - Google+ calendar was, for a while, adding others
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.160]   to your private events without warning.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.680]   (laughing)
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.440]   So if you're having a birthday party tonight
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.000]   and somebody you didn't invite shows up,
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.400]   it's not your fault.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.240]   - I just have this vision,
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.680]   that's how Kramer gets to a meeting
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.520]   in the company on Seinfeld, in the modern Seinfeld.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.040]   - No, I think, it's the same one I think it was.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.760]   I think it was them being oversmart.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.600]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.920]   - So you make a note to yourself to meet with someone
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.760]   and you include their email address,
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:55.360]   or then Google would say,
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.360]   oh, you're obviously trying to arrange a meeting with,
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.200]   so if I say, contact frettedsmith.com,
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.960]   does a note to myself in the calendar,
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.600]   then it will send a meeting invitation
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.760]   to frettedsmith.com, if you put it in the title.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.320]   That was the bug.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:13.000]   Which, you know, you can see how they thought of that
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.840]   as a thing, but, yeah, clearly that,
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:17.840]   you don't want it doing that.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.960]   Or at least you want a confirmation dialogue.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.400]   - Yeah, and probably you shouldn't use email addresses
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.600]   in your event titles.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.880]   So as an example, this is the guy who discovered
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.480]   this, Terence Eden, who says he writes about
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.880]   mobile's Shakespeare politics and usability.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.480]   I don't know where the Shakespeare comes in, but anyway,
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:41.120]   he says, "My wife likes to set reminders
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.280]   "for herself in Google Calendar."
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.640]   Recently, she added a note to a personal Google Calendar,
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.360]   reading email, "Alice@example.com,"
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.360]   to discuss pay rise and set the date for a few months from now.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:53.360]   - Oh.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.720]   - A few months later, Alice, her boss,
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.200]   sent her a meeting accepted email.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.440]   (laughing)
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:09.000]   - Oh dear.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.160]   - What do you say?
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.000]   If you hit the smart create button, quick add.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:15.840]   - Quick add.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.560]   - If you hit that, then I wouldn't be surprised, right?
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.400]   - Yeah.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.000]   - Click quick add and say meeting with,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.760]   yeah, who's email address.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.280]   - Be careful who you use email address you use.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.200]   - Yeah, I'm gonna stick with you.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.360]   - Huh.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.600]   - Leo at his company.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.920]   - I've always, yeah, Leo at Twitter.TV you could use.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.440]   I've always, 'cause I don't read that.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:39.440]   I've always seen a, "Would you like to email
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.320]   "an invitation to this person dialogue box?"
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.240]   And which you could then say no.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.240]   - Send, don't send.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.240]   - Send, yeah.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.240]   So I don't know.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.720]   - No, that's what I got when I,
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.480]   when I got that I said send invitations.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.600]   - Yeah.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.080]   So here's the video of it.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.040]   He's, yeah, you know what?
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.720]   It's the quick entry.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.760]   It is, it's what you said.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.080]   It's the quick entry.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.120]   - Yeah, so the quick entry is trying to pause the phone.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.200]   - That's what you're trying to do.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.000]   If you say, if you put an ad in there, it does location.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.680]   If you put a time or date, it automatically figures it out.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.000]   Now see, there's the configuration,
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.320]   but he clicks do not send and it still sends.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.160]   Whoops.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.480]   - That's a bug.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.280]   - Actually, I've had that happen.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:23.840]   Because I, okay, this, this, actually I have seen this bug.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.880]   But unlike Terrence, I just, it wasn't paying attention.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   I always make, I put somebody's email in calendar stuff
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.560]   when I do a show, I put the, like maybe your email
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.640]   or whatever gene in the calendar
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.120]   and say don't send an email
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.480]   because I want the Moto X to think I'm on a meeting
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.600]   unless there's somebody in the calendar event
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.120]   and it won't be a meeting.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.880]   So I always put names and Chad, maybe do you get emails
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.400]   for me every, like every week?
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:55.880]   - Yes, I get a, I get a, this week in tech is starting now.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.200]   - Yeah, okay, that's because, but now did you see
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:01.800]   in that video, he was showing if it wasn't the quick ad,
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.720]   it didn't do the pop up.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.480]   - Oh, so it isn't the quick ad that's the problem.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.960]   - It was, it was normal ads.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.080]   - It was when you click in, click edit and then a new event
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.200]   and it just did it automatically in that video.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.520]   - He says Google has tried to be clever, same,
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.640]   they said Brit, they all say the same thing.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.520]   It's tried to be clever here, it has failed
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.120]   just because I'm talking about someone,
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.560]   doesn't mean I'm talking to someone
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.720]   that is exactly right.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.920]   - But that's, again, it's just, it's a failure
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.320]   of artificial intelligence and the word.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.920]   - Imagine how much worse it could have been.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.760]   - Yeah.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.760]   (laughs)
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.560]   - Talk to boss about, about resigning
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.880]   or talk to employees by firing them.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.040]   (laughs)
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.120]   - Chad, forget those emails, I said.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:42.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.960]   (laughs)
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.800]   - That's interesting, I never have.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.120]   So the fake meeting I just set up for next Sunday,
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:54.440]   it says guests yes, maybe no awaiting one.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.120]   - Oh, you must have sent me an email.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.600]   - Yeah, definitely did.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.680]   (sighs)
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.200]   - Well, let me check my mail.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.320]   Well, it's gonna take a while to do that.
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.840]   - Leo, it's with your TV, you have to check that one.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.400]   - Yeah, that's gonna take, I don't even know
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.920]   what the password is.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.000]   (laughs)
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.160]   - Don't wonder you don't respond to my email.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.360]   - No, yeah, don't mail me there, that's,
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   you know better than that, don't mail me at Leo@twit.tv,
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.960]   who's that?
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.320]   I'm gonna log in.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.960]   Fortunately, I have last pass remembers it.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.200]   See if I get an invitation from Kevin Marks.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.000]   (laughs)
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.200]   Nope, not yet.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:37.880]   - Okay.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.720]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.840]   - Well, did they fix this, right?
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.680]   - Oh yeah, they fixed it.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.520]   - It must have fixed this by now.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.360]   - Except it, yeah.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.680]   - It does say, it does say awaiting in guests.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.480]   - Huh, well maybe it's not an important and unread,
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.600]   maybe it's in everything else.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600]   It's important.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.440]   (laughs)
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:54.680]   - If you search for Kevin Marks, do you?
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.520]   - Oh yeah, you.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.560]   (sighs)
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.720]   - Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you?
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.720]   - Yeah, no, it's still work, it's still doing it.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.560]   - Is it?
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.400]   - Yeah.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.240]   - Yeah, well.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.240]   - So here, I can do it live.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.160]   - Did you get one?
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.160]   - Yeah, so here, delete, notify guest.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.320]   So if I'm here and I just add an event
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:15.680]   and it immediately hits--
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.000]   - He's just looking at the calendars and say--
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.600]   - He's a busy boy, I'm a busy.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.920]   And hit edit event and then I type in something.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.920]   So I have email Leo@twit.tv to ask him
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.840]   to stop leaving Aussie poop at my desk.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.680]   (laughs)
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:32.280]   And I just hit, and I hit save one second, let me let you see it.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.880]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.280]   - Didn't ask, didn't ask, didn't ask.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.320]   And if I jump back in, you have been added as a guest
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.160]   on this event.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.000]   - Well that's normal, that doesn't mean I got an email.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.800]   But it didn't see the thing about email guests
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.120]   but Kevin's seeing that awaiting as well.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.360]   - I see that awaiting is a bit suspicious.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.040]   - Yeah, like that means it's, in theory it's emailed me
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.840]   a an invite, but I haven't seen an invite, so.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.440]   - And at the bottom of this Verge story, it says,
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.200]   Google says that it's aware of the issue
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.000]   and is actively working to fix it.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.120]   So maybe it is not fixed.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.760]   - I have this, you canceled the event, Chad?
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.080]   I got an email that you canceled the event.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.520]   (laughs)
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.760]   It's been removed from my calendar.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.080]   But it was added to my calendar, I didn't even say anything.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.240]   - So, well go to your calendar on that.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.000]   - I don't have a calendar Leo@twit.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.520]   (laughs)
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.600]   But it's been removed, so we gotta do it.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.240]   I don't, it's enough.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.680]   It's a problem.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.520]   - It's a problem, yeah.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.040]   So the moral of the story is,
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.640]   do not type people's email addresses
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.440]   in invitations as I see ones who invite them.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.880]   - 'Cause Google is very, very helpful.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.160]   - You know, this is the problem with robots
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.240]   and computers in general.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.480]   They don't understand anything,
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.640]   but they're trying to be helpful.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.000]   - Well, this is the part one
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:47.840]   we'll fix the problem. - But this is the point
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.200]   we'll fix the problem. - And project, right?
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.920]   They're trying to build this system.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.800]   - Maybe DeepMind will fix this.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.640]   - Yeah.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.880]   - DeepMind will know that we don't want to fight someone
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:57.880]   firing. - Yeah.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.200]   - This week with, do you see the State of the Union one?
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.520]   - No.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.560]   - It's, I put it in the rundown.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.480]   - Let me check. - Something right now.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.320]   - And rundown.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.240]   - And I've, when Gmail just saved me from,
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.680]   I put the wrong, you know, John in an email,
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:13.920]   and it's a donner, oh, you know,
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.760]   did you mean this John?
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   - It's just a good job with that.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.600]   - You're right, it's great.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.600]   It's brilliant. - Oh.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.480]   - Yeah, that could be fun.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.920]   Especially when it's like, I'll say which is the three,
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.080]   people with the same name, when the same icon,
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:25.920]   I want the meeting.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.880]   It's like, mm-hmm, show me the email.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.880]   So, this is,
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.880]   joined the State of the Union,
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.880]   a friend of mine searched for State of the Union,
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.880]   and it showed a link to a CNN story
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.880]   with a picture of President Nixon.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.880]   (laughing)
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.880]   - Was it this year's State of the Union,
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.880]   or was it doing a 1967 State of the Union?
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   - It's a join the State of the Union.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   - So it's in the bottom of the Google.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880]   - Oh, I see it, yeah.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   Oh, Tantec did this.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.880]   - Tantec did this, yeah.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.880]   - Tantec did this, yeah.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:58.880]   And it's like,
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.880]   this is an extension of the knowledge graph stuff,
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.880]   and it's like a sort of,
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.880]   - Like a,
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.880]   - That's a terrible,
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.880]   - Ignorance graph or something.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.880]   It's like a free association graph.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.880]   They're trying to make these machines behave like brains,
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:13.880]   and they are behaving like brains.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.880]   They're like, oh, President of the United States, I know.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.880]   - I know the President is Richard M. Nixon.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.880]   I shall help you with a small picture of him.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.880]   (laughing)
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.880]   - I'm not sure where that comes from.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.880]   - It's the first thing they found at our State of the Union,
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   I guess.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.880]   - Somebody must have done a history of State of the Unions.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.880]   - It maybe came from CNN.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.880]   You know what?
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.880]   That's probably what happened.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.880]   - Maybe CNN.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.880]   - It could be a CNN.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.880]   Well, he said, now Tantec said there was no Nixon image
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.880]   on the linked page.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.880]   - No, the images often do not,
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.880]   very often do not match.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:48.880]   Very often.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:49.880]   - Yeah.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.880]   - They're picking from elsewhere.
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.880]   - Hmm.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880]   - Hmm.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:18:00.880]   - So, you know, we saw that with the feature,
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.880]   T unit talked about with the graphs,
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.880]   knowledge graph things being attached to stuff.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880]   - You're a lot of part of it.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.880]   - First of all, I said, by name, I found, like,
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.880]   on various different websites, different little cards about me
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   that had different bits of information on them,
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.880]   that they'd crawl from different places.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.880]   And they would actually crawl the one off my own website,
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.880]   which I carefully marked up with micro formats and sent to them,
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:19.880]   and they would crawl that,
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.880]   but they'll crawl Wikipedia and they'll crawl, you know,
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.880]   Google+, and they'll crawl a few other places,
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.880]   and then couple stuff together and say,
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:26.880]   "This is what we think we know."
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.880]   - I've got an idea for a new feature on the show,
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.880]   though, Google glitch of the week.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.880]   Just where a computer did something really dumb,
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.880]   trying to do something smart.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.880]   'Cause you know what?
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.880]   This is just the beginning.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:41.880]   - Google Bot, or pause?
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.880]   - This is my theory about AI,
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.880]   is that the AI they're going to have to build
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.880]   is a sort of self-justification AI,
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:52.880]   which is, you know, the latest theories
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.880]   about how our brains work is that
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.880]   the lower levels of our brains decide something unconsciously,
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   and then this sort of personal narrative part of our brain
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.880]   makes up a reason why we did it.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.880]   And there's all these wonderful experiments
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.880]   where they can do this by getting people,
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.880]   showing people something with their non-dominant eye,
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.880]   and then they will then confabulate an explanation
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.880]   for why they were thinking about that thing
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.880]   with the part of their brain that I was speech,
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.880]   with the other eye.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.880]   And there's a bunch of experiments like this,
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.880]   which is, they've basically shown that
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.880]   we decide something, we make an association,
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.880]   and then we will come up with a plausible
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:37.880]   sounding explanation to ourselves for why we did that.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.880]   And I suspect that's going to be the next phase of AI,
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.880]   and that's going to start getting really scary,
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   because they'll get good at baking up plausible explanations
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.880]   for why they showed a picture of Nixon.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.880]   You know, here's something really sad,
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.880]   and I hope this doesn't become a trend,
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   but we're seeing it in San Francisco.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.880]   Protesters not only defacing and protesting
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.880]   the buses of Google and Apple and other big corporations
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.880]   that have a bus for their San Francisco employees
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.880]   to bus them down, the complaint is, of course,
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.880]   the gentrification of San Francisco,
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.880]   the increase in rent and all of that stuff.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   And now here's one,
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.880]   a protesters show up at the Berkeley doorstep of the guy
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.880]   who wrote the code for the self-driving car,
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.880]   an image was distributed by a group called Counterforce.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   Anthony Lewandowski is building an unconscionable world
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.880]   of surveillance, control, and automation.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.880]   He is also your neighbor,
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:32.880]   urging people to go to his home on Tuesday
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.880]   and protest.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.880]   This is so sad.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.880]   - Yeah, that's weird.
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   - We don't want to fall into the Perkins comparing this to
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.880]   Kristallnacht.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:47.880]   - No, it's not Kristallnacht.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.880]   - Like I'm saying.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.880]   - But he said it's a,
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.880]   he, of course, the founder of Kleiner Perkins
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.880]   in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece,
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.880]   likened this kind of stuff to a progressive,
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.880]   Kristallnacht, the Nazi persecution of Jewish,
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.880]   Jewish shopkeepers by breaking their windows.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:11.880]   - The most extreme example of Dottwin's law,
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.880]   I think I've ever seen.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.880]   - Yet, I also don't think it's,
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:19.880]   I mean, what he's saying is, you know,
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:25.880]   what we're seeing is demonization of computer scientists.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.880]   - Fine.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.880]   - I don't argue with that, but to compare that to the--
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:30.880]   - It's not the same as killing six million Jews,
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:35.880]   but it is nevertheless a demonization.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.880]   - Did you see him in Difiran Bloomberg
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   where he went even more off the deep end?
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.880]   - Yeah, is that, I couldn't find that online.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:43.880]   Is that online?
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.880]   - I don't know.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:47.880]   I would assume that Bloomberg would post it.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.880]   - He's older and out of touch.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.880]   I'll give him--
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:51.880]   - Yes, he is.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.880]   - It's just, it's not,
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.880]   I understand what he was trying to say.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:57.880]   He said it in a very ham-handed and inappropriate way.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   However, I do understand what he was trying to say, which is,
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.880]   and I think this is something to be,
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.880]   to potentially be feared,
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:08.880]   is the mob turning against technology.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:09.880]   - Well, and Leydikes.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.880]   - Leydikes.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.880]   - Part of this too, and again,
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.880]   I hate it following what he said because he was such idiocy,
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:20.880]   but the new 1% is the technology community.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.880]   - Right.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   - If you take my argument,
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.880]   the technology leads to efficiency overgrowth.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.880]   It leads to greater profitability, productivity,
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.880]   and thus wealth, but wealth from the hands of technology people
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.880]   at the expense of huge numbers of jobs,
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.880]   not directly from robotics or that kind of stuff,
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.880]   but just through new efficiencies and new networks.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.880]   - Well, let me just say you called me a Luddite last week
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.880]   in a way that was highly inappropriate, and I resent it.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.880]   - Oh, oh.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:47.880]   (laughing)
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.880]   - I'm gonna pick it your office.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.880]   (laughing)
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.880]   - Luddite.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.880]   - But this is the Luddites because that's what happened.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.880]   Ned Ludd and his protesters broke the looms,
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.880]   the mechanized looms because they were being put out of work
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.880]   by this technology.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.880]   - We're gonna see that.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.880]   - Where the word Luddite comes from.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.880]   - Nope.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.880]   - Ned Ludd may well be a mythical character, but nevertheless,
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.880]   it's where this came from.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:17.880]   And that was in 1779, so...
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.880]   (laughing)
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.880]   The more things change, the more things stay the same.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.880]   - But that was, you know, the Luddites was explicitly a job displacement.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.880]   - Yeah.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.880]   - So that is, you know, that's...
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.880]   - I think there's a legitimate...
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.880]   - I think there is a legitimate...
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:32.880]   - There's a legitimate...
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.880]   - But there's a...
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.880]   - It is an economic protest, though.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880]   It's housing displacement.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.880]   We are being evicted by the gentrification.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:43.880]   This new one percent is taking away our city.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:48.880]   - To which I say, would you prefer that the entirety of the economic benefit
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   and jobs and everything else of the technology revolution had happened in Cleveland?
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.880]   You know, San Francisco...
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.880]   - So you're complaining about success.
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.880]   It's a weirdly American thing.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.880]   - Well, I was trying to have this debate with Anil on Twitter.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:10.880]   And I think the analogy is it's like they're sending buses to Brooklyn and Manhattan
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.880]   to take the employees over to their jobs in Newark,
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.880]   where they feed them all day and then send them back at the end of the day.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.880]   If you actually look at the distance, it's about the same transition.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.880]   - Yeah.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.880]   - And Newark would be delighted to have...
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.880]   - I think Mountain View is very much like Newark.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:27.880]   There's actually...
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.880]   That's a very good analogy.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.880]   - And the reason they do it is nobody wants to live in Newark or Mountain View.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.880]   They want to live in San Francisco or Manhattan.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.880]   - I mean, you know, I need to do something.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.880]   - But I want to be a stop now that's complaining.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.880]   - It's San Francisco that's complaining.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.880]   - Yeah, but the complaining...
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.880]   The bus thing is they're complaining because they're clogging up the city bus stops
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:49.880]   for these buses.
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.880]   - Yeah, however, if you took all the people out of the bus,
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:56.880]   and had them in their cars, it would be a hell of a lot worse for everybody.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.880]   - Yeah, and obviously it'd be much better if they, like,
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.880]   subsidised car train and put wifi on it.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.880]   - Nevertheless, what this is really about,
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.880]   and I think there's a legitimate point need to be made here,
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.880]   is the fundamental problem of income inequality,
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.880]   which is a growing problem nationwide.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:11.880]   - Yes.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.880]   - And that is where Tom Perkins is the, you know,
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:17.880]   appalling poster child for it, where he pops up with his ridiculous intent.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.880]   - You know, these poor people are just really getting on my nerves.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.880]   - What was this, Kevin?
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.880]   What was the watch part of the Perkins thing?
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:31.880]   - The watch was, it was something about Rolex watches,
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.880]   and as an assigned Perkins said,
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.880]   "Well, for this watch, I could buy a six pack of Rolexes."
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.880]   [laughter]
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.880]   And then it's like, what?
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.880]   And then the interview were followed up with him.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.880]   - He's too rich, and he's too out of touch.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:44.880]   It really is, it's gone.
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:50.880]   - It's a rich and meal watch, and I was given to it by the company that built my yacht.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.880]   So this is like fractal, conspicuous consumption.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.880]   Just what playing it for kids.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.880]   - He can't stop.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.880]   That's the problem.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.880]   - But that's, you know, it is this weird, there is this weird problem,
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.880]   and it's a, you know, it's the fundamental attribution error.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.880]   It's the root of all psychology, which is when I do something,
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.880]   it's because I'm great, and we do something, it's because you're,
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:14.880]   you're, you're weird.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.880]   You're, you're, you're, it should be things different depending on who you are.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.880]   - Here's the Bloomberg, here's the Bloomberg piece.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:25.880]   - I mean, Silicon Valley is, I think, Kleiner Perkins itself over the years
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.880]   has created pretty close to a million jobs, and we're still doing it.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:30.880]   - It's a good idea.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:41.880]   - It's absurd to demonize the rich for being rich and for doing what the rich do,
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:45.880]   which is get richer by creating opportunity for others.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.880]   - How do you feel threatened?
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:50.880]   - Well, I said I didn't feel personally threatened.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   I feel, however, that as a class, I think we are beginning to engage in class warfare.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:05.880]   I think the rich as a class are threatened through higher taxes, higher regulation.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   - Oh, God.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.880]   - And off of my case, I want to move to an island.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.880]   - That is my message.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.880]   - You know, we have an island for you.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.880]   You and Lovey can move there.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.880]   Bring your Rolexes.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.880]   - Yes.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.880]   No, this is, but, you know, it's, it's.
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:26.880]   - But he also has a point.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.880]   - He has a point, but it's this dreadful trickle down point that was made 20 years ago
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.880]   and has shown not to actually work.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.880]   - I think fundamentally technology.
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:38.880]   - He has not created that much wealth with his yachts and his watchies.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:39.880]   - No, I agree.
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.880]   - He's just for the people.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.880]   - But I, and venture capitalists aside, technology is a democratized,
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   is a democratizing, it can be both.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.880]   I mean, the problem is that the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the Alliance had a point.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.880]   They were being displaced.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:54.880]   - Yes.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.880]   - They, they were, they were, they were, they were.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.880]   - Yes.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:01.880]   - And it's only a matter of time before all the travel agents rise up and go to the Expedia
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.880]   offices and with torches and pitchforks.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.880]   - But it, it, it is, it is a, it is a, it is a structural problem we have economically,
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:13.880]   which is that the kinds of jobs that we create with technology are much fewer in number.
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.880]   And require much, much, you know, much more qualifications to be employed with them.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:21.880]   - I do think there's more opportunity, there's opportunity if you have education,
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.880]   there is a lot of opportunity.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:28.880]   - But there, but the sort of, these, the sort of the large swath of the American middle class,
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.880]   which was people who were doing, you know, factory work jobs and things like that,
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.880]   that's gone.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.880]   There was, there was a.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.880]   - We've seen this coming for 20 years.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.880]   Jeremy Rifkin wrote about this literally almost 30 years ago in the end of what we did.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.880]   - 50 years ago in the end of work.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:45.880]   We know this was happening.
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   - There was a fascinating thing from Pew Research, which I'm going to stick the link
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:56.880]   in the chat room, which was, did I put it in the right place?
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.880]   - Yeah.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:58.880]   - Yeah.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:01.880]   Few Americans identify as middle class.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:03.880]   And this is like quite striking.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.880]   So from 53% being middle class, saying they had middle class in 2008,
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:13.880]   now 44% say middle class and 40% say lower class up from 25.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.880]   So there's, I think there's two things going on here.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.880]   One is the notion that everyone's middle class, which was the, which has been the premise
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:21.880]   of American politics for a long time.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.880]   You've got to get the middle class.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:28.880]   But I suspect the other part of this is the Occupy movement saying actually the,
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:34.880]   there is a big problem of the 99% and there are people who are, you know,
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:35.880]   who are taking money from you.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.880]   And there's definitely a clear sense of loss of aspiration there,
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:40.880]   loss of this.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:44.880]   Oh yes, we can all be middle class and you can see it kick in like 2011.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.880]   There's a, there's a step function.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.880]   - There's a drone coming for you, company.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:51.880]   - Be very careful what you say next, Mr. Marx.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.880]   It could be your last.
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.880]   - I just dropped off an Amazon package.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:30:01.880]   - No, I think that in Davos things that we went to, Eric, pretty often.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:03.880]   - Davos, but yeah, let's bring up Davos right now.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.880]   That's going to calm the waters.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.880]   - Do she?
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:10.880]   Do she?
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:16.880]   So Eric, Bryn Jolfsson and Andy McAfee from MIT who wrote the racing of the
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:20.880]   machine Kindle single of a new book out and they're exploring this.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.880]   I'm starting to read in it, but they're exploring this idea.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.880]   I think it's a gigantic story that we haven't dealt with.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:29.880]   I wrote about a year and a half ago about the notion of a jobless future.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:34.880]   We are simply going to have fewer jobs and we're not dealing with that.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:35.880]   - Yeah.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.880]   That was what Rifkin said in 1995.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.880]   Actually, he said it earlier than that, but anyway.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.880]   All right, we're going to take a break because this is depressing.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:48.880]   - And I've got to go take my Lexus to the dealer.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.880]   I can't understand.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.880]   No.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.880]   It keeps taking me through poor neighborhoods.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.880]   I've got to get that GPS fixed.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:02.880]   That's a joke.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.880]   Okay.
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:05.880]   Boy, there's no laughter at all.
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.880]   - No, no, I'm with you.
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:07.880]   I'm giving you a smile.
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:08.880]   - You gave me that.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.880]   I did buy an $1,800 toilet the other day.
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.880]   And you're going to sale it on the scene.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:20.880]   - I'm making jobs for people making toilets.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.880]   I showed it.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.880]   - People did ask you to stop with the poop on the show.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:29.880]   - Who's people?
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.880]   Four people on Twitter?
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:32.880]   - Well, that's not people.
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.880]   That's four people on Twitter.
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:34.880]   That's a different thing.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.880]   - We'll actually chat already did poop.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.880]   This is the third poop in a row week.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:39.880]   - I have not mentioned.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:40.880]   Well, I did.
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.880]   - I mean, it was dog.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.880]   - We are a little different.
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:46.880]   - Everybody poops.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.880]   It's poop.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.880]   - My daughters taught me anything.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.880]   It's a poop is a big part of life.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:54.880]   (laughter)
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.880]   - Freud said it's this fundamental thing.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:59.880]   Let's talk about Squarespace.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:02.880]   This is a much nicer topic, shall we?
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.880]   (laughter)
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.880]   - I want to buffer here, Leo.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:08.880]   - I should buffer.
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:09.880]   I should briefly buffer.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.880]   Everybody just look at your Rolex for a moment
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.880]   or whatever watched your architect happen to give you
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.880]   for building a yacht.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.880]   And it's the talk, Ticks.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:25.880]   - No, I do actually think income inequality is a growing problem.
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:28.880]   And it's very clear just from the numbers.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:29.880]   - Yes.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.880]   - And you know what?
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.880]   Maybe these protests in San Francisco are just the beginning
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.880]   of something that could be much, much.
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.880]   - No, Occupy Wall Street was a dramatic.
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:38.880]   - Or dramatic.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:39.880]   - Occupy Wall Street.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:40.880]   - This is the Occupy.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:41.880]   - That was aimed at bankers.
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:42.880]   This is no any technology.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.880]   - Okay, safety.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.880]   (laughter)
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.880]   - Wait a minute, here's a new picture from the chatroom.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:56.880]   Thank you, F and Don, for your Photoshop buffer.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:00.880]   (laughter)
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.880]   - Low mileage, 2.91 billion.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.880]   The sale has been made.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.880]   Surprisingly, a large number of people came into the chatroom
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.880]   and said, "Lonovo, just bought Motorola.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.880]   Have they talked about it?"
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:14.880]   (laughter)
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.880]   - You got to watch the show from the beginning
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:18.880]   if you want to get all the jokes.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:22.880]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com,
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.880]   the all-in-one platform, that makes it very easy to create
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.880]   your next website.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.880]   You know, I think this is, you know, I have to say,
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:32.880]   for all of the issues, one thing that does democratize
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:35.880]   this world is the ability to create your own website

[01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.880]   Time for Gina Trippani's Tip of the Week.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:04.880]   Just in time for Super Bowl, Twitter has some new search filters.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:06.880]   I'm pretty kind of excited about this.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:10.880]   When you search Twitter, you can not filter results by people, photos,
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.880]   videos, news, but this is my favorite one.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.880]   You can say, "Just show me tweets from people I follow,
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.880]   or just show me tweets from people near me."
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:22.880]   So much easier to kind of go back and see your friends' tweets
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.880]   about certain topics or hashtags or whatever.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.880]   And you can try it out with Super Bowl.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.880]   You can see if, you know, a friend of your friends have talked about the game
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:32.880]   or any of the ads.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.880]   You can say, "Just show me videos with the word Super Bowl in the tweet."
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:39.880]   So, you know, commercials before they go live or after they get posted.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.880]   Just a really nice way to kind of unearth old tweets.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.880]   I just went back and favorited, you know, a bunch of my friends got notifications
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.880]   that I favored and stuff that they had posted months ago
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.880]   because I was just searching around for keywords
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:53.880]   and found, you know, good stuff that I had missed
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.880]   and kind of flown by me in my stream.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:56.880]   Very cool.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:57.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.880]   Of course, you should have think up as well.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.880]   Oh, yes.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.880]   That way, you know everything that's going on on Twitter
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:06.880]   and all the people following you and all your most popular tweets
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:07.880]   and all that stuff.
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:08.880]   Yeah, well, of course.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.880]   And Facebook.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:10.880]   And Facebook.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:11.880]   And Facebook.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:12.880]   Oh, I forgot to add my Facebook.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:13.880]   I got to do that.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:14.880]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:16.880]   I love think up.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:17.880]   Thanks.
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:18.880]   You know, too...
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.880]   I'll show you to focus just this week.
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:22.880]   This is the one that cracks me up.
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:23.880]   This is from a few days ago.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:26.880]   Did you see that free advertising followed Leo Leport?
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:28.880]   Finally!
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.880]   Yeah, we're going to work on that algorithm.
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:34.880]   No, no, that's somebody that followed me.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.880]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.880]   You see my most popular tweets from years gone by.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.880]   List some on.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.880]   Oh, oh, you got something.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.880]   You got an error there.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:44.880]   That shouldn't be there.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:48.880]   You know, object number B bracket P has no method F.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.880]   I think you might want to go to work on that, Gina.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.880]   That's a Google charts API bug.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:55.880]   Google.
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:56.880]   What?
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:57.880]   What?
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:58.880]   What is up with that?
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:37:59.880]   What?
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:00.880]   I should be a nice graph there.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.880]   But I mean, I'm not going to go to work.
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.880]   It's going to be a nice graph.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.880]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:13.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:41.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:46.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:54.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:57.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:00.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:06.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:09.880]   I'm not going to go to work on that list.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:12.880]   I think you have an obligation to look out the window.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.880]   Don't you?
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:14.880]   Am I wrong?
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:15.880]   Oh, good cases.
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:16.880]   I do believe.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:17.880]   Really?
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:18.880]   I should look up the case law.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.880]   I just want them to fix it.
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:21.880]   I like the car and other respects.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.880]   I just want them to fix the...
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.880]   I'll show you the picture.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:32.880]   This is the smoking gun picture.
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.880]   I'm driving down a road, but apparently it's in the middle of the woods.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.880]   [laughter]
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.880]   Technology gone bad.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:45.880]   You're right.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:46.880]   It's a nice car.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.880]   Somebody said it's a nice car.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:48.880]   Just enjoy your car.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.880]   Yeah, but you know, you...
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.880]   It's a time machine.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:52.880]   It's a time machine.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.880]   I used to be in...
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:55.880]   Oh, that's what it is.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:59.880]   Before they built the road, Google Earth is saying,
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.880]   "This is a new feature of Google Earth."
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:03.880]   [laughter]
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.880]   Google Prehistoric Earth.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:06.880]   Right.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.880]   I think I see a dinosaur down there.
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:09.880]   [laughter]
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:13.880]   Kevin, Mark, do you have a thing or anything you'd like to share with us?
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:14.880]   A tip or something you like?
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.880]   I think we have a couple of things.
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:23.880]   One is it's Homebrew website club tonight in both San Francisco and Portland.
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:28.880]   If you want to chat about building your own websites and IndieWebThings,
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:30.880]   it's 6.30pm tonight.
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.880]   We can have a video link between the two.
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:39.880]   Chat about IndieWeb staff and websites building around website.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:45.880]   That happens every two weeks, every other Wednesday.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:46.880]   You mentioned you were doing this.
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:47.880]   I'm glad it's going well.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:48.880]   That's great.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:49.880]   Yeah, no, it's interesting.
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:51.880]   It's a nice group of people.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:58.880]   It's trying to build the web of your own staff primarily
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.880]   and then use the social networks to share it.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:02.880]   That's the sort of core of the IndieWeb message.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.880]   It's a nice group.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:05.880]   I get on with them.
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:11.880]   The other thing I wanted to mention was Model of View Culture,
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:18.880]   which is a new magazine about the deeper perspectives on technology.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.880]   Some of the stuff we talked about in the middle of the show today about
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.880]   its impact on society and what's happening and things like that.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.880]   That's Shanley Kane's new startup.
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:33.880]   She's been in different relations in a bunch of different companies.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:37.880]   She's quit that sort of magazine.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.880]   That's very interesting.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.880]   I recommend that.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.880]   Very nice.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.880]   Very cool.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.880]   Cool.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.880]   What's the URL again?
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.880]   That one's I think it's just Model View Culture.
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.880]   I think Model View Culture.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.880]   Dot com.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:02.880]   I have so many.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.880]   Give them all.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:08.880]   Well, we could do the 100 seconds it took to fire two-thirds of Patches staff
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.880]   and a voice message.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:17.880]   We could do Prince Sue's 22 now former fans for $1 million each.
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.880]   What's he suing him for?
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:21.880]   You're a fan.
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:22.880]   I sue you?
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.880]   We could do the Guardians says blogs turn 20, but I'm not sure I agree with that.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.880]   So I'm going to skip that one.
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.880]   For the fifth year, Google is the best place to work.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.880]   But I think I'll settle here.
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:35.880]   Okay.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:43.880]   On an old Lico's patent, Ringo wins 1.36% of AdWords revenue.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.880]   Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.880]   That's actually was in our rundown.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:47.880]   I should have mentioned that.
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:48.880]   That is a huge.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.880]   Are they going to appease Google going to appeal?
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:51.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:53.880]   It's going to appeal.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.880]   So what is the patent?
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.880]   The patent was, oh, I read it earlier.
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:03.880]   1.2% of AdWords revenue has got to be a lot of money.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:05.880]   It's 1.36%.
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:08.880]   So I'll take the right, that route either you just lost.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:15.880]   The rounding error alone would buy you a very nice home in San Francisco.
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:21.880]   The AdWords program was tweaked by Google after the Ringo verdict
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:25.880]   and it wasn't colorably different from the old infringing problem.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:26.880]   Oh, man.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:27.880]   That is a tick.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:31.880]   So I presume there is room to appeal this.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.880]   Jackson followed the methodology laid out in an East Texas case in which Yahoo was found
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.880]   on fringe on online advertising patent, my fame and patent role.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.880]   You know, it's just one more of this stuff.
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:44.880]   But Jesus, 1.36% of Google AdWords.
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:47.880]   Hmmm.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:48.880]   Geez.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:49.880]   It's good money.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:51.880]   Nice work if you can get it.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:52.880]   Yep.
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:53.880]   Yep.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.880]   Can I tell one other story real quickly?
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:56.880]   Yes, please.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:05.880]   I steer my yacht out of Davos and come into Zurich Airport to go up to the hotel for the night.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:08.880]   So I haven't really played out the next morning and I stopped by the Starbucks.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.880]   And I can't have any Starbucks in Davos because there aren't any.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:13.880]   And B, because I can't get decaf coffee and I have to have decaf coffee.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.880]   I can't believe so.
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.880]   There is no Starbucks in Davos.
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:18.880]   It is tough.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:20.880]   Well actually the coffee clash.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:23.880]   The coffee clash in Davos is one of the best places in the world.
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.880]   Oh, there you go.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:25.880]   The writer loves it.
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:26.880]   It's wonderful when Google takes it over.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:34.880]   Anyway, so I go into the, to a basement Starbucks in the Zurich Airport and I go up and I say,
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:41.880]   "Good novents" and I ask for a medium decaf skim latte.
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:42.880]   Name please.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:43.880]   Namabita.
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:44.880]   Jeff.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.880]   The guy looks up and he says, "Twig?"
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:47.880]   What?
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:52.880]   And so the picture, the picture is in there of a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, nobody
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:53.880]   forgetting his name suddenly.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.880]   Uh, Chad, can you put the picture up?
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.880]   It's the last one in the, in the number of sections.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:58.880]   You're right.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.880]   Yeah, I saw it actually on your Google+ set.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:01.880]   I'm exploding.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.880]   There we are.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:03.880]   Such a cute picture.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:04.880]   That's so good.
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.880]   It is.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:06.880]   It is.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:07.880]   Uh, what, can you read his name?
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:08.880]   I can't remember his name.
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:09.880]   That's adorable.
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:10.880]   Thank you.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:11.880]   Isn't that great?
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:12.880]   He's a twig fan.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.880]   He's working at the, at the Starbucks event I think.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:14.880]   In 10.
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:15.880]   That's the same.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:16.880]   10s.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.880]   He's, that's a, he said say, uh, Tibetan name.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:20.880]   Is that it?
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.880]   Is it?
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:23.880]   That's a Sherpa name.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.880]   I wonder if he's, uh, from team, it looks like he's pretty good.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.880]   So, so he said, "Oh, could you take a picture?"
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:29.280]   I said, "Oh yeah, I gotta have one too."
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.880]   So the, the, the fellow in Burris took a picture of us, which I just think was great.
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:33.880]   Isn't that neat?
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:34.880]   So, that's fantastic.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:36.880]   This is the small world of Twit.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:38.880]   This is the power of Leo Laport.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.880]   This happens to, it's happened to me in Munich.
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.880]   It's happened to me in Zurich.
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.880]   It happens to me people recognize me from this wonderful show.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:46.880]   Thank you.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:47.880]   Bless you, Leo Laport.
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:49.880]   All over the world.
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.600]   Well, recognize.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.720]   You must be as a dovel-sky.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.080]   Let me see your whole ex.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.080]   All right.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.640]   I don't have a pick of the week.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:03.240]   I was going to pick this Talon app, which is a new Twitter app that's quite gorgeous
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:04.240]   and beautiful.
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.040]   Have you guys talked about this and all about Android?
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:08.840]   Uh, which app is this?
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.880]   It's a new paid Twitter app called Talon.
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:11.880]   Oh no.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:12.880]   We haven't talked about Talon.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:15.040]   And it's specifically for KitKat.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:21.480]   It's quite beautiful, but, and I was going to recommend it, but it is, it is, uh, killed
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.480]   my battery.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.480]   Oh.
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:30.680]   I mean, and they even say they, because this, it will do streaming of your tweets and he
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.880]   does say, you know, I don't recommend this because it could kill your battery.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:34.880]   T-A-L-O-N.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:37.080]   Um, I can't remember how much it is.
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:40.640]   I think it's four or five dollars.
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.440]   But you know, that's nothing compared to the cost of this wristwatch.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:49.320]   So, so a Talon there it is.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.320]   Talon for Twitter.
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.320]   Talon.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:54.000]   But you know this, I had looked at it as an I thought, I, you know, I need to use it for
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.320]   a couple of days before I, you know, I'm bringing up in the, in the arena and I just hadn't gotten
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:58.320]   around installing it.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:59.880]   So you like it, but it killed your battery.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:00.880]   That's wonderful.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:04.400]   And the story and the, one of the reasons I want to talk about it, the, the story about
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:11.440]   the author is kind of cool too, if I can find his name.
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:19.120]   He, he's a student, a full-time student who kind of just wrote this in his, in his spare
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:20.120]   time.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:22.120]   He has a number of other apps as well.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.920]   I don't think there are any businesses that are writing Twitter apps.
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:30.200]   Twitter apps would be crazy, but it has a Talon poll.
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.320]   A lot of things that will just kill the battery.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.720]   There it is, Clinker apps.
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:39.360]   And it's just so, it's just a neat, it's just a neat story about, yeah, yeah, we've,
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.800]   yeah, we're, we're familiar with this.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.440]   This kids going somewhere.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.360]   So I got this Jacob Plinker.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.840]   circa, sent me an update about the Motorola purchase.
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:53.640]   And apparently Google is going to retain ownership of project, the, the division that
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:48:00.800]   runs Project ARA, which is the modular smartphone, effort for making smartphones.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:01.800]   You can snap together.
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:02.800]   Google's keeping that.
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:03.800]   Oh, interesting.
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:07.120]   Yeah, I'm not surprised because that's a very lab-y kind of thing.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:08.120]   Something about the output.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:12.680]   Yeah, the division in charger Project ARA is called Advanced Technology and Projects and
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:14.120]   headed by former DARPA chief.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.960]   And so Google, Google, hold on to ARA, which is nice.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:19.000]   I really wouldn't be, want to be in that division right now.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.280]   Just saying.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:22.640]   By the way, the chatroom's telling me it's a buck 99.
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.120]   It has, just was updated yesterday.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.160]   So maybe the battery life issues are better.
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:27.440]   I will try it again.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:31.360]   And the author is a student at the University of Iowa, Jacob Clinker, who's written some
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:34.000]   really good by himself.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.080]   Some really good apps.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.240]   This is a kid to watch.
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.760]   Obviously very, very smart.
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.800]   It's compatible with all versions of Android.
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.800]   You don't have to have a KitKat.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.520]   All right.
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:49.520]   That's it for the show.
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.320]   Hey, thank you very much, Jita Trippani.
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:52.320]   Is it ThinkUp.com?
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:56.920]   Do you have a timeframe for consumer version?
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.920]   Next couple weeks.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.840]   We're actually going to be at New York Tech Meetup next Tuesday night.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:04.440]   We're trying to, we're scrambling, but if not next week, then the week after.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:05.440]   Excellent.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:07.440]   Excellent.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:08.440]   Excited.
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.440]   Thank you.
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.440]   Another great show.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.440]   Love the, always a pleasure.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:14.360]   We'll see you on all about Android on Tuesdays, 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern time as well.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.360]   Absolutely.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.320]   Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.960]   He is also a fabulous writer.
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:25.480]   You can catch many of his books at Amazon, all of his books at Amazon.com, including the
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:30.480]   fabulous public parts and free they only Gutenberg the geek.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:32.680]   Save a buck.
