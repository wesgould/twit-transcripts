[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.120]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.120]   to show the covers of Google versus the cloud.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.360]   A lot of Facebook lately too, and joining us
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.640]   the usual cast of brilliant people
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.400]   starting with in the upper left-hand corner,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.800]   Gina Trapani of smartawear.org.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.280]   Hello.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.840]   Life Hacker, our token developer.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.120]   Oh, oh.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.560]   Well, somebody has to do it.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.880]   Great to have you.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.120]   Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com,
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.920]   a great post about Facebook this week, which we'll talk about.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.720]   In a little bit, he is a professor of journalism at Cooney.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.480]   You could see the Cooney sign over your right shoulder there.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.000]   That's nice.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I like that.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.560]   There.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.560]   There.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.360]   I'm geographically dyslexic.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.360]   And one of the people joining us, one of the people today,
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.680]   one of my favorite people in the world, Doc Serals, who
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.560]   was one of the authors of the Clue Train Manifesto now
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.000]   in its 10th year.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.760]   And he's currently at the Berkman Center at Harvard University
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.440]   studying-- is it VRM, Doc?
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.560]   Yeah, it's V.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.920]   As in victory, but as it stands for vendor relationship
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.440]   management, which is kind of the reciprocal of customer
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.080]   relationship management, which senses Chuck Mail and makes
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.120]   his cannot loyalty cards and do other inconvenient things.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.640]   It's then.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.200]   We're trying to come at everything from the customer side.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.240]   So we're equipping customers with tools
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.520]   that make them independent of vendors,
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.240]   but they're able to engage with vendors.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.600]   And we're doing this basically using open source stuff
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.840]   so that commercial guys could build stuff on top of it.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.600]   It's great.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.040]   What is the response from commercial guys?
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.320]   The cover of this week's, I should pull this out.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.280]   Here we go.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.760]   This is a Clue Train effect here in a long time.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.160]   Here we go.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.880]   It says, I am not an eyeball.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.160]   This is a copy of--
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.360]   OK, this was the--
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.680]   CRM Magazine.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.840]   Cover of CRM Magazine.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.640]   And in the small print there, it says,
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.200]   your customers don't belong to you,
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.000]   and neither does the customer relationship.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.360]   It's about half the magazine is devoted to VRM
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.480]   and what Clue Train said 10 years ago and how we were right
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.120]   and stuff like that.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.080]   So yeah, it's starting to happen
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.520]   if you're four years of work and development
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.760]   is starting to catch on.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.160]   If you go to doc.serls.com, is it .com?
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   You'll find a link to Doc's stuff at Harvard
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   and the project VRM web page, which is at the Harvard.edu
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.000]   address.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.080]   But it's easier to remember, doc.serls.com.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.280]   Great to have you here.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.040]   I've been meaning to get you on this show
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.520]   and all of our shows much more.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.240]   Much, much more.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.520]   Because like Jeff and Gina, you're a thinker.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.440]   And God knows we need thinkers these days.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.280]   Gina, you're going to be in town as well as think.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   You do and think.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.880]   Do and think.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.840]   But you know, we got doers and we got thinkers,
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.440]   but I think we got to think before we do or something.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   It's something like that.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.880]   I did that for 58 years.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.840]   I'm trying to do for the last four or so.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.760]   Enough making.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.600]   Now's some doing.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.920]   Gina, it will be coming to the Bay Area
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.420]   next week.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.120]   So maybe we can get you to come up to the college.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.840]   Because Google I/O is next week.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.200]   Yes, I'm very excited.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.040]   What is Google I/O?
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.520]   We keep QR codes everywhere.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.160]   Google I/O is Google's developer conference.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.000]   It's a two day get together at Moscow and West Center.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.520]   Moscone.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.020]   Yes.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.520]   Moscone.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.020]   Moscone.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.560]   I've actually never been there.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.800]   That's also where WWDC goes on, right?
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.280]   That's right.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   That whole conference.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.360]   I'm very excited.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.200]   It'd be my first time there and my first time at I/O.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.360]   And yeah, it's Wednesday and Thursday of next week.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.320]   Now, can only developers go?
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.480]   Or probably the inksdained retches are not allowed in?
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.880]   You know, I registered as just a regular 10 days a developer
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.400]   paid my way.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.240]   But I'm sure that press goes for the keynotes and stuff.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.640]   I'm sure that they issue press passes.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   But I just decided, hey, I'm just going
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.440]   to go as a regular person and attend some of the--
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.280]   What do you expect?
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.480]   --the sessions.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.040]   I think there's going to be a lot of really good stuff at I/O.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.320]   Actually, it's really interesting.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.000]   They released-- they're not printing programs on paper,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.320]   right?
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.960]   They released an Android application,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.360]   which is the I/O schedule.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.600]   It's got all the different tracks.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.800]   You could take notes.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.320]   You can mark a session of these favorites.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.160]   They said that there would be printers on site
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.800]   if you really have to print out the program that's out there,
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.680]   which is kind of interesting.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.480]   Who would do that?
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.920]   I mean, look at the looks you would get using standing over
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.800]   by the printer.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.240]   I'm going to go over to the printer and get a piece of paper.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.640]   I mean, yeah.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.960]   There also-- they're going to be waving all of the sessions,
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.680]   which, of course, made me happy because I wrote a book about wave
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.760]   and I'm excited to--
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.160]   I felt like that kind of indicated this bigger commitment
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.520]   to wave from the company as a whole.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.280]   I think they're going to be using wave and Google moderator,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.360]   which are two kind of--
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.720]   Moderators cool.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.680]   Yeah, moderator is cool, but it's not a product
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.800]   that you hear about a lot, right?
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.760]   So I think that they're going to kind of combine the two
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.280]   so that audience members and even people who aren't at I/O
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.360]   can watch people take notes and ask questions, which
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.680]   can be really neat.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.880]   So we can attend in a way.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.720]   We can attend I/O by joining the wave.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.560]   Right, by joining the wave, exactly.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   But in terms of--
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.320]   I'm trying to announce--
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.600]   It's coming together of your worlds.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.880]   I know it is.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.840]   I'm so excited.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.480]   I'm out of my mind about it.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.960]   Yeah, that's really neat.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.960]   Yay.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.280]   In terms of announcements, I mean, I
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.040]   think there's going to be some major play to Android, probably
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.480]   and wave, but especially Android.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.880]   So I wouldn't be surprised if we saw Google TV get at least announced
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.560]   or perhaps demoed.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.720]   Obviously, all the attendees got a free Android phone.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   It was not free.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.440]   I mean, it kind of came with the price of your ticket, the
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.320]   droid.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.560]   And all the--
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.400]   You chose the droid.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.200]   You could have an Nexus One or a droid, right?
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.080]   No, actually, in the US, you got a droid.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.880]   If you were in Europe, you got an Nexus One.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.000]   Yeah, which is--
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.200]   I would have chosen another Nexus.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.760]   That's surprising.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   Google didn't give it--
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.040]   I guess they'd already given Nexus One's out, so--
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.640]   And they kind of encourage you to start your Android app
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.600]   before you arrive, that kind of thing.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.280]   And obviously, there's a whole Android track.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.160]   So I think we're going to see some Android announcements.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.480]   I'd be really excited if Frojo came out during--
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.760]   2.2.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.200]   2.2, that would be very exciting.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.280]   But beyond that, I'm really excited to just be around a
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.040]   bunch of nerds to develop for Google.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.800]   Always fun.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.120]   Always fun.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   We're trying to figure out how we're going to cover it.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.240]   The keynote, which is probably where most of the big
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.160]   announcements will happen, is that morning, Wednesday morning,
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.760]   before we do this week in Google.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.880]   So maybe I can come down for that.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.720]   You know what we could probably do?
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.360]   We'll figure it out.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.040]   Maybe find a local in San Francisco that we can do the
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.800]   show, Skype, you and Jeff.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.440]   And maybe bring in some Google I/O folks and do a special.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.040]   Yeah, that would be--
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.840]   I mean, I would love to see the studio, but it'd be cool if
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.040]   we could pull in a couple of people.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.240]   We have a facility--
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.920]   we can use this right next to Moscone.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.600]   So I think we can probably do that.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.160]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.000]   What did you say?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.360]   That was the keynote.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.600]   Who speaks?
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.120]   Who--
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.040]   Who doesn't--
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.640]   We don't know.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.680]   I don't know.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.480]   I am Googling.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.560]   Does it matter?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.800]   Is there someone that--
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.840]   I mean, there's no Steve Jobs for Google.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.920]   No, that's exactly it.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.640]   You wouldn't expect--
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.440]   you wouldn't even want Larry or Sergey to talk.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.760]   They're kind of figureheads at this point.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.480]   Or at least visit and say hi, guys.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.200]   But to see him.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.800]   But there is nobody who's like the--
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.960]   There's a burger.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.120]   I think it's Jeff.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.880]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880]   I'd like to say--
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.720]   I don't know if you should speak.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   I don't know if we're--
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.880]   I know what Google's going to do.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.920]   You just wrote a book about it.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.400]   That's all.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.520]   I'm looking through it right now.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.480]   And of course, as usual, it's very hard
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.080]   to find stuff on Google's site.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.280]   They need a search engine or something.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.200]   Speakers, wait a minute.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.680]   Like here's speakers.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.840]   Now they just have all the names.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.560]   This is a really long list.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.360]   This is a long dang way.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.120]   Thank you for organizing the world.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.000]   That's a part of talking.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.040]   Now maybe they can organize their own pages.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.520]   Well, there will be some interesting stuff to talk about.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.280]   In fact, Verizon says they're going to do a Android
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.200]   tablet.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.640]   Yay.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.600]   But also, three months late.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.920]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.640]   Is it too late?
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.240]   Is the iPad?
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.720]   I don't know.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.520]   Is it too-- I just-- I want that I've
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.800]   heard this announcement three months ago.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.760]   TechCrunch published it.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.680]   Eric Schmidt made fun of the tablet and Davos and said,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.160]   tell me what the difference is between this and a big iPhone.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.880]   So I don't think-- I think it sounds a little rushed, actually.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.080]   That's one of those sayings people trot out.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.320]   But that makes no sense at all.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.000]   It's like saying, what's the difference?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Oh, a swimming pool.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.800]   It's just a big bathtub.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.000]   Well, I have with me the tablet that replaces them all.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.160]   Whoa.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.400]   What is that?
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.880]   This is the Intel Web tablet.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   It's pretty old looking.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.680]   It's got an antenna on it.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.680]   The late '90s.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.440]   That's the old Intel logo.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.840]   It was the old Intel and it worked on Intel any point.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.400]   And there were only a few production items made.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.960]   Let me see if I can-- here it is.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.000]   Surf 150 feet away from your couch, from your PC.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.840]   That's a good example of-- I think the tablet technologies
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.720]   weren't there.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.440]   I mean, there was no Wi-Fi.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.280]   The idea was for something to browse on and surf on the web
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.200]   was there back then.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:02.720]   Right.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   It was really cool.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.920]   I also, by the way, brought into my office for a museum
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.800]   with my old Q-cat.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.240]   That's back, baby.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.160]   The cat got his back.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.200]   I have-- let me see what else here.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.840]   I have my news catcher, which was--
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.040]   --a flanking interval thing where you get the news on.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.440]   Right.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.600]   There's a store.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.080]   I have my old Moto.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.880]   Every day of these, it's got the original little news feed.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.240]   And then finally, the planet, Portful--
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.080]   this is my favorite.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.720]   What the heck is that?
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.560]   URLs were just too hard for us little people.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.640]   So it gave us buttons to push, like computers and health
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   and beauty in Wall Street Journal.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.160]   And this was what we were supposed to plug into our computers
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.920]   because URLs become--
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.480]   Oh, please.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.880]   Well, that was the idea of the Q-cat, too,
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.800]   as you would scan it.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.640]   So it would type a URL in for you.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.280]   I'm trying to get myself from the museum.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.640]   I'm establishing here at CUNY of Dead Technology.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   I'm trying to get myself an old trash 80, the Radio Shack
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.160]   thing I'm used to you.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.880]   You know what?
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.160]   I really wanted anybody the audience has this?
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.640]   I would kill to have the old Mojo wire, Xerox
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.840]   helicopter, portable that we used to have to take
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.040]   with us on assignment and put in the sheets one
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.840]   at a time and go, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.920]   That's that thing.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.760]   With an acoustic coupler on it.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.480]   I want to mini-grasp machine because I
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.760]   miss the smell of the ink.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.960]   Port Gina is sitting here saying, how did I get on the show
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.360]   with old men?
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.040]   It's just a bunch of old men and me.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.080]   What am I doing here?
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.480]   HTC is responding to Apple's lawsuit.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.040]   Instead of suing Google soothes the handset manufacturer
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.200]   because they don't have any patents.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.120]   HTC has announced today that it's suing Apple for violating
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.360]   five of its patents.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.040]   Hey, we got some patents too.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.120]   And asking the ITC, just as Apple said,
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.680]   halt the sale of the HTC phones.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.120]   They're asking the ITC to halt the importation and sale
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.200]   of the iPhone iPad and I fought the United States.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.000]   Wow.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.240]   This is what happens.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.160]   Patton Ping Pong.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.920]   Mutually assured Patton destruction.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.400]   Anyway, I hate-- I don't even like talking about those stories
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.640]   because they're just-- they're not
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.920]   about getting something done.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:14.080]   They're about tying things up and it's not good.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.840]   Happy birthday, says Gina Trapani, to the shell script
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.880]   that runs my life.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   What's that all about?
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.040]   It's true.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:23.600]   It's true.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.280]   I wrote the shell script like four years ago.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.880]   Actually four years ago today.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.400]   You live on a bash script.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.760]   I do, I use a bash script to organize my to-do list.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.720]   It's kind of embarrassing.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   I didn't know you're going to call this out on the show.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.440]   I love this.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.360]   No.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.120]   I think on the first show we mentioned to do.sh.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.600]   Yep.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:38.920]   Yep.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.880]   It's so funny because the contents of the script now
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.680]   are so kind of far beyond my skill level that I'm just like,
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.280]   I know it works and I can sort of identify chunks of code.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.280]   But it's been taken over by Unix geeks far beyond my skill
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.200]   level.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.240]   But yeah, no, I've been using it every single day.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.000]   And so when I mark a task as done,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.800]   it goes into this done.txt file.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.480]   And I looked at it because I was like, oh, this is four years later.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.960]   And it's like over 1,000 lines of stuff that I've done.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.080]   So I could just like grab this history of four years
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.800]   with the activity.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.880]   I love it.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.280]   Love it.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.600]   Love it.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.000]   So I have four years.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.240]   Crap is an organizational tool.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:09.680]   Thank goodness.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.520]   Crap is an organizational tool.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.440]   Crap sort.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.960]   Now when they write a command line Facebook, I'll be back, baby.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.360]   A command line Facebook is it.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:18.680]   Is it?
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.280]   But I think--
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.120]   You're trying to do it.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   What's that?
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.600]   Of course she uses fine.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.080]   Of course she's--
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.280]   Oh, you know.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.880]   No, she's mutt-re-pied.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.800]   That's right.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.960]   That used to be-- it was Emacs versus vi mutt versus pine, wasn't it?
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:39.520]   But now Jean is part of our nostalgic moment here.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.640]   She's starting to sound like an old man.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.160]   So I think my first Android application, or at least my first attempt
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.000]   at one, is going to be manipulating
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   to do text and interfacing with Dropbox's APIs
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.840]   to be able to mark things as done and save it back
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.960]   to Dropbox, so it kind of updates all your computers.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.320]   So I just applied for Dropbox API access today.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.760]   So that's going to give it a shot.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.400]   I thought it'd be a pretty simple, cool little first app.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.240]   There's something magical about text.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.440]   It's so easy to manipulate.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.400]   It's so small.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.320]   It just works.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.120]   So we have--
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.920]   It's an old thing that does not belong in Jeff's museum.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.920]   Because it still works.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.000]   It's the museum of stuff that's old but not dead.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.240]   And it's just too useful to ever give up.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.920]   Do you have any asked?
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.760]   Do you think we'll ever get to the point where
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.880]   we really start to use the keyboard as an exception?
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.720]   I think we're getting close with Apple buying Siri.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.360]   You don't think so, Doc?
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.680]   Well, yeah, it depends on what for.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:39.640]   I mean, if you're writing, I think the keyboard does what it does.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.720]   This is just--
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   It is 19th century technology.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.840]   But when was Quirti invented?
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.600]   I mean, it's going to be around for a while.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.240]   I guess it survived.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.440]   But boy, I wouldn't mind seeing something better.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.160]   And with--
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.240]   I think Google's getting better and better at dictation.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.360]   It's dictation everywhere on the Android.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.640]   And I think Apple said basically by buying Siri,
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.000]   we wanted to do something similar.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   But the problem is, I don't, anyway.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.560]   I don't speak in final draft.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.960]   I still have to go in and change it.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.640]   I still have to improve it.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.840]   So I need an editing tool.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.040]   So that's still going to be a requirement, I think.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.360]   You know what we're talking about VRM?
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.800]   What do you think of Doc of this whole Facebook issue?
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.600]   This really seems to be an example of--
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.600]   Which Facebook issue?
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.360]   Which of all--
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.560]   I think there are many faces to the Facebook issue.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.760]   But there's an over--
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.200]   I think there's an overarching story
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.440]   that Facebook is ignoring its users, right?
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.640]   Or not paying enough attention to its users.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.280]   Well, I think with Facebook, there's
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.320]   a lot of fear about Facebook's going to eat the web.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.800]   And what Facebook is doing is building the great indoors.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.760]   It's the Mall of America or something like that.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.440]   I think it's still AOL 2.0.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.680]   And it's a tree that will not grow to the sky
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.520]   to keep changing metaphors.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.080]   And as long as they're trying to make advertising,
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.360]   there are main sources of revenue, it's going to be a problem.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.320]   I think the problem with this sort of wet dream
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.200]   that everybody's got in the advertising business
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.080]   is we'll make advertising as personalized as possible.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.680]   And what it's doing is raising all these privacy red flags
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.800]   because people basically don't want personalized advertising.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   I think most people don't.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.160]   It's like they'd rather be a little bit anonymous.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.200]   They'd rather be a little bit generalized
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.480]   rather than--
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.320]   I don't know, Doc.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.520]   If you're going to get stuck with advertising anyway,
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.960]   wouldn't it be nice to at least make it somewhat more
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.200]   relevant if you have to control over it?
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.640]   So have you gone through when you're on a Facebook page?
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.560]   OK, so I've got 700 friends on Facebook.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.120]   And I see three ads on the right.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   I've gone through dozens and dozens of dozens of those.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.920]   And clicked on the thing that-- look at all these other ads.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.240]   I'm getting ads for under 30 singles.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.880]   I'm getting ads for--
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.360]   Well, that's just because it doesn't work.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   They're doing a bad job.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.920]   Where even the basic demographics of me are not well understood.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.440]   Right, but they're doing a bad job.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.520]   So you're actually making the point, I think,
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.360]   here you're complaining about the irrelevant summit.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.800]   And if they did a better job targeting, you'd be more--
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   I actually-- I would pay not to see any ads at all
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.000]   because they're paying the ads.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.400]   That's a different model.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.320]   Well, it's a different model.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.360]   But I'm not trying to prove personalization.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.120]   What I'm trying to do is explore whether or not they're
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.080]   actually getting good at it.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   And I don't think they are.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.360]   I actually don't think even Amazon is that good at it.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.080]   Amazon is recommending to me books that I've written.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.640]   They're recommending to me books that have already
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.000]   bought from them.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.080]   Well, this is a hard thing.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.240]   This is kind of a famously hard thing to do.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.160]   Netflix put a million dollars up for just a small percentage
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.120]   improvement in its recommendation engine.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.600]   It's a hard thing to do.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.040]   But I don't think that that's an indictment of the notion
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.960]   that advertising that's targeted to something
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.440]   you're interested in is a bad thing.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.680]   I think customers-- don't consumers say they want that?
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.640]   They don't like--
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.320]   Well, I don't know.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.680]   First, I think we've moved past the point
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.720]   where we're all consumers.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   I think we're producers as well as consumers.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:05.560]   We're producing is not just better, more finely targeted
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.400]   crosshairs on our back for people who are working a percentage
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.240]   game at maybe we're going to respond to one thing or another.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.760]   I mean, I think, as I've said before,
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.720]   that improving a pain in the ass does not make it a kiss.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.760]   And what we need is a kiss.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.160]   And the kiss isn't going to come from a company that's
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.680]   advertising.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.760]   It's coming from a company that actually knows us
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.160]   and has a relationship with us.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.240]   And it happens within that relationship,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.640]   knowing that we're looking for X, Y, or Z,
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.280]   not that they're hiring Facebook or even Google
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.680]   as an intermediary to help them target even better
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.240]   what I might want.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.840]   I think that there's-- that the inherent inefficiency
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.920]   of advertising in the long run makes it something of a bubble.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.040]   And I think part of the bubbleness of advertising
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.120]   is that we're all talking about how to make it better and better
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.080]   and better and better and better.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.800]   And there's a limit to that.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.640]   When we cross that limit, it may not even
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.840]   be advertising anymore.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.600]   It might just be what we call relationship.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.200]   I love the doctors that is that advertising is failure.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.120]   In the ideal, you have a great product of service.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:04.640]   People love it.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.280]   They sell it for you.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.360]   They're supported for you.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.880]   You have a relationship with them.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.960]   You advertise when that fails.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.680]   Well, I think there's a place for advertising as we know it.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.600]   I think sports, for example, is always
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:23.120]   going to have ads for yellow beer and for erectile dysfunction
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.200]   relief and for big trucks.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.320]   That's going to happen for the duration, I think.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.040]   And it's going to pay for--
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.520]   That's targeted because, as we know, people who like football
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.920]   have a hard time getting heart counts.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.480]   This is not my--
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.000]   What's that?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.800]   I missed the joke.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.800]   No, don't worry about it.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.880]   I hope everybody did.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.360]   I'm--
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   It's--
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   I don't think that was the only thing--
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.000]   I don't think that was the way.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.360]   But I think what's going to happen
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.760]   is that a capacity that was inherent in the net
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.760]   in the first place, which is it puts everybody
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.560]   at zero distance from everybody else,
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.360]   will allow the demand side to engage the supply side
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.680]   with far more efficiency and granularity
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.480]   and trust and a bunch of other things
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.880]   than it has had so far.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.640]   And my perspective on that is that the web is--
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.080]   the web, as we know it anyway, is maybe 15 years old.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.040]   That's what-- since Netscape 1.0, it's been about 15 years.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.480]   It's a software in high school.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.960]   As Frank Stacey has said when I was interviewed in North Carolina
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.880]   last week, it's not old enough to download its own porn.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.880]   So--
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   And so we're inclined to think that, you know, oh, gee,
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.080]   Google or Facebook or Twitter, all these things
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.000]   are the end of times.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.480]   They're not.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.080]   No, no.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.560]   It's weird.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.880]   Yes, of course.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.120]   It's all provisional, as you know, even better than I do.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.680]   Because we're covering--
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.360]   Well, we also do-- we're ad-supported media.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.240]   I can't, for a variety of reasons,
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.560]   charge people for our content.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.320]   So we have to pay for it somehow.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.400]   We pay for it with ads.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.120]   And it's somewhat targeted by its nature
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.960]   because people know that, well, anybody listens to a show
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.640]   about Google's going to be a geek.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.240]   So we have ads for products, you know, for geeks.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.000]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.360]   No, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.120]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.520]   I think, you know, if you have a wine magazine,
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.080]   you know, I kind of work for Linux Journal.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.200]   You know, we've been thriving for 15 years, 16, 17 years,
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.040]   whatever it's been.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.880]   You've got ads in there?
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.040]   But they add for boards and adds for various kinds of software.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   I think--
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.480]   I know ads for Viagra.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.320]   And no ads for Viagra.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.520]   We probably could use that.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.040]   Open source advocates--
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.920]   Have no problems.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.200]   No problems in the paper.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.280]   I actually think that geek stuff gets these guys up.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.040]   So it's all right.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.240]   That's not a problem.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.240]   That is Viagra.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.920]   It is.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.920]   Well, the reason we bring this up-- we've
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.240]   spent several weeks talking about it,
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.520]   and not just on this show, but on all our shows,
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.160]   the eroding Facebook privacy policy.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.120]   You know, you just wrote a good post,
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.960]   Jeff, about the difference between the public and a public.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.360]   And it's your thesis that that's really the disconnect,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.160]   that neither Twitter nor Facebook kind of understand
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.960]   what a public is.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.480]   Right.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.800]   I've been doing some research because I
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.400]   think this is the topic of my next book.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.000]   Another one, huh?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.880]   Yeah, I'm not going to debate it properly.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.720]   I probably do this instead.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   Because I've been trying to think about this idea
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.200]   of publicness and the value of publicness.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.600]   And then we talk all the time about the fear involved
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.800]   with privacy.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.480]   And that's inherent in this.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.000]   And so I'm trying to understand why
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.240]   was the reaction to this so volatile, so vitriolic, more
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:29.800]   than anything else?
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.080]   Was it just a last straw?
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.760]   Or was there something else here?
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.520]   And I think that as I did research looking back,
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.920]   there's the notion of Habermas.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.200]   Now, that's the most intellectual thing
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.680]   I'll say in a long time.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.400]   In the 18th century, we saw the emergence of the public sphere.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.800]   But before that, what Gutenberg did and art
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.240]   did and printed music did was the ability
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.480]   for people to create their own publics.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.680]   And so I saw in there, I hope maybe a little bit
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.960]   of a glimmer of where the confusion is for especially
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.480]   Facebook, that I think that Zuckerberg thinks
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.760]   that once it's public, it's public.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.200]   But we made things in Facebook public only
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.840]   to a public, our public, the public we control.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.200]   In Facebook, we control who's in our public.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.880]   In Twitter, we control what publics we join.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.360]   In blogs, we publish to the whole public.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.320]   To the public.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:23.760]   The public.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.840]   The public.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.200]   And so this separation of a public and the public,
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.480]   so it sounds really like a way to say it.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.080]   And I don't know a better way to say it.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   I think that's the line that Facebook crossed.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.840]   So this idea that, oh, you already made it public.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.320]   It's OK.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.400]   I'll publish it to the world.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.240]   Well, no.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:40.760]   I didn't.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.120]   That's not what I was doing.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.200]   Well, I'm going to make it really complicated for you
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.680]   to decide what you're doing with your public.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.760]   No, that was the whole point of Facebook.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.520]   That was this whole value that it added
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.880]   was that it was real names and real relationships
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.240]   and real people and not this anonymous world
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.200]   we had in the web as a whole.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.840]   And now it's mixing up the two.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.800]   So it's all about context, right?
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.880]   So you're saying, you know, this is the public that reads my blog.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.880]   This is the public conference with on Facebook.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.600]   See, I think that's the difference
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.080]   between the advertising that freaks me out
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.400]   and the advertising that I appreciate.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.280]   Like, I appreciate personalized advertising,
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.840]   but not when it's so specific that I'm like,
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.360]   what?
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.840]   How did you know that about me?
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.440]   Well, that is creepy, isn't it?
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.040]   It's creepy when the ad says, hey,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.240]   like 34-year-old singles in San Diego on your cross street.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.800]   That's pretty obvious on Facebook
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.080]   because you gave them all that information.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.920]   Right, and I know that.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.080]   But my sister-in-law saw that ad,
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.920]   and the age changed from yesterday,
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.240]   and then it was her birthday.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.840]   And then it said 37-year-old, and she said, wait a second.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.600]   Well, it knows.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.680]   You told them your birthday.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.760]   Well, you told them here.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.080]   This is what--
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.720]   But I think that that's the difference
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.680]   of being creeped out.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.640]   I mean, if I'm watching "The Ultimate Fighter,"
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.360]   which I love that show, but it's so clear.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.680]   It's a Spike TV, which is like for 20-year-old,
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.640]   hormonal guys, and all the advertising is beer, and--
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.160]   Red Bull.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.520]   --master trucks and all that stuff.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.040]   And it's like, OK, here I am participating
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.600]   in this sort of community of people who likes to watch people
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.480]   beat the death.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.120]   And I kind of expect that the advertising
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.920]   doesn't apply to me.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   But--
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.480]   So the real question is, why are you watching UFC?
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.840]   I don't know.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.400]   I don't know.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.240]   There's this weird Greco-Roman thing.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.560]   I don't know.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.080]   It goes on.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.680]   It's also very gay.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.360]   I will make your--
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360]   That's even here, Garza.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.320]   So instead of--
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.600]   --it's instead of Glee, you watch UFC.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.360]   I get it.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.960]   I watch UFC and Glee, yeah.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.480]   OK.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.480]   OK.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.360]   But you don't--
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.440]   This is why advertisers are confused about you, Gina.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.400]   They have no freaking idea what you are.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.000]   That's your benefit.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.800]   But if I got an ad during "The Ultimate Fighter,"
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.560]   that was clearly targeted toward women who live in San Diego
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.640]   and work in tech, I'd be freaked out.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.080]   I'd be like, they know something that they should know about me.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.600]   But time and time again, surveys
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.760]   have been done where people say, I hate ads, unless it's
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.480]   an ad for something I'm interested in knowing more about.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.960]   Then I like ads.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.560]   I mean, we know this.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.400]   We can go looking for them.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.160]   Sometimes you go to Google Search,
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.000]   or when you buy Vogue magazine, you are seeking out ads.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.640]   And then that's the contract you have.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.920]   And that's why, by the way, ads in search
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.840]   work better by several orders of magnitude than anything else.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.760]   That really works.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.720]   So I don't have a problem with Facebook in that regard.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.440]   There's a very telling, I thought,
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.880]   in an interview with Facebook executive in "The New York
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.200]   Times" today in the "Bits" blog.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.240]   What did you think of that?
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.440]   The attitudes seem to be opt-in.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.920]   Well, when you joined Facebook, you--
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.120]   That's the opt-in.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.320]   You joined.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.960]   To me, I was seeing red.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.440]   I was living.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.600]   It was one of a number of data items that convinced me.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.760]   And I'm going to do it later on the show
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.400]   to delete all my presences on Facebook.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:00.240]   It was so disingenuous, it was so clearly disingenuous,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.840]   that I just felt like these--
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.600]   OK, if I were ever--
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.800]   Is it disingenuous or is it delusional?
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.480]   Because that's what I think is going on.
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.080]   I mean, I--
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.160]   That's a good question.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.440]   I think it's an honest mistake.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.600]   But it's a gigantic mistake.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.480]   You think it's honest.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.600]   So Jason Calicanis, we wrote a post, which also--
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.040]   Jason's talked about this before on Twitter.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.240]   He obviously-- there's something between him and Zuckerberg.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.560]   He does not like Mark.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.160]   And it was a vicious post.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:28.560]   But--
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.760]   JOS--
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.280]   I don't--
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.040]   You know, maybe.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.960]   And you could certainly say that they're both entrepreneurs.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.480]   Mark has had huge success.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.520]   Jason's had success, but nothing in that order.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.320]   But I think that he makes some very good points
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.000]   in between all the evituperation.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.560]   And one of the points is that Mark is amoral.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.120]   And then Facebook is ultimately amoral.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.720]   And that's the question I was trying to ask.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.360]   And we should go-- we'll go to Jason Ward a second.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.440]   But I think that's just the question I was trying to ask,
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.640]   is that I think that Mark believes fully.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.000]   And I got emailed from others saying
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.320]   that after reading more, Mark said
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.640]   that they don't agree with this.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.920]   But my assumption in the past has been
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.800]   that he really does think that by connecting people,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.720]   he changes the world.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.400]   So the more we connect, God damn it, disconnect.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.520]   And you should do that.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.960]   The problem I have here is I think
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   that he didn't define--
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.560]   Google defines and redefines evil all the time, famously.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.680]   I don't think that Facebook has ever defined evil.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.880]   What's going too far?
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.960]   And they don't have a culture of doing that.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.800]   They don't have a culture of enabling people to ask that.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   And so it leads them astray in a way
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.160]   that's going to hurt the company.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.760]   The other piece of this is not just your publics
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.800]   and the public.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.240]   It's also identity.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.920]   And if Facebook thinks that it can control our identity
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.760]   in this world, it's quickly becoming wrong
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.280]   versus what I said in my post, Leo,
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.480]   was your view last week with Gina
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.920]   about if Google made your personal profile page the first link
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.760]   on the search for you and it became canonical.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.120]   I control my identity.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:54.840]   That's your identity.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.920]   That's the identity you control.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.280]   So Facebook is potentially losing this huge investment
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.600]   in a way that I think--
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.920]   and then the PR stuff also shows them to be tone deaf to this.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.440]   Yes.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.520]   In a way that I think that if we're purely cynical,
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.920]   they'd be better at it.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.760]   Listen to what Eliot Shragge's vice president
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.720]   for public policy at Facebook says in this New York Times
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.080]   interview, he says, nobody at Facebook
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.920]   wants to make our users' lives more difficult.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.640]   We want to make our users' lives better.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.160]   Our mission is for Facebook to be the best place in the world
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.640]   to connect and share with friends and family.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.600]   And he says, we're just not doing a good enough job
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.960]   communicating.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.240]   We're not telling you what's going on.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.880]   I just don't think that they're delusional.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.400]   I think that they're deluding.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   I think that they're really actively attempting
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.080]   a number of things.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.160]   And it doesn't, to me-- and I'm not
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.120]   worried about them selling information about marketing.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.560]   That's not to marketers.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.760]   That's not what I'm worried about.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.560]   I'm worrying about a power grab.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.680]   They're trying to control the internet.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.920]   They want to--
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.400]   So you already control your info there.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.320]   That's not the issue.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.880]   So what's your worst case analysis for what Facebook does?
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.720]   That everything in the world goes through Facebook
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.440]   with the like button.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:10.120]   That Facebook is the ultimate home for all this data.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.560]   And that everything that we do, everything we participate in,
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.680]   is mediated by Facebook.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.040]   Gina, Doc, what are your worst fears?
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.680]   That every major web app will incorporate the Facebook
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.360]   mechanisms, like the like button, just like Leo said.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.360]   And that, just like Leo said, that I'll
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.200]   be interacting with Facebook even when I'm at my favorite web
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.640]   apps, because they're like, well, Facebook has the users,
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.800]   and they can drive the traffic.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.400]   It's all Facebook Connect.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.440]   Yeah, like, everything becoming Facebook Connect.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.240]   Now, weirdly, I'm not really that worried about Google Ads
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.840]   being everywhere, or Google Analytics, JavaScript snippets
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.760]   being on pretty much every web page I visit every day.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.520]   And it goes back to--
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.120]   Google, Google, Google seems to have
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.320]   sort of this public conscious conscience,
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.760]   in that they do constantly define evil and redefine evil.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.080]   Google has a little bit of a guilt complex.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.760]   Yeah, they're like Germans.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.760]   They're like, oh, we were bad.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.200]   You could tell that they do.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.840]   With Facebook, Facebook's just sort of like asperger.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.480]   Like, just completely.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.280]   And that was the word, by the way, of very inflammatory word
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.480]   that Jason used to describe Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.640]   And I wouldn't use that word, but I would use the word, perhaps,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.880]   amoral, not immoral, but amoral.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.840]   And there is a certain thread going
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.760]   through a lot of technology and a lot of technologists
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.120]   where the technology trumps all.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.040]   We can do it, so we will do it.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.240]   And that's not our-- we don't need to worry about morality.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.840]   We're just technologists.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.400]   You know, it's Oppenheimer versus--
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.920]   Wow.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.040]   They want to be the biggest nuclear power on the net, I guess,
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.360]   and to lose everybody.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.400]   Oppenheimer had a conscience--
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.360]   I can't remember the other guy's name, but he was just--
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.800]   A tennis, trust the T.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.080]   Jackroom.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.120]   It's the old men again.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:31:59.720]   Teller.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.280]   Teller.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.520]   Teller.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.880]   Teller just said, well, no, we're just--
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.560]   we're going to invent it.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.720]   That's not our job.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.400]   We're scientists.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.960]   It's not our job to moralize or determine
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.040]   what it's being used for.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.240]   It is merely our job to invent it.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.240]   And Oppenheimer said--
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.800]   It's a Tom Baresong.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.720]   The rockets go up.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.440]   There they go down.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.200]   That's not my job.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.560]   Not my job.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.880]   Not my business.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.400]   And I feel like that that is a thread in technology
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.960]   that we need to be really aware of alert to and fight.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.040]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.960]   That is something that I think all geeks have to keep in mind,
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.640]   for sure.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.140]   It's funny.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.960]   I don't want to say amoral because that feels--
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.880]   That's a judgment.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.720]   It's a judgment.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.360]   Oddly and judgmental to me, too.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.680]   Like, uncomfortably judgmental to me.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.720]   I don't mean a judgmentally.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.480]   It's supposed to say asperger's is pretty judgmental.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.520]   I don't mean a judgmentally.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.120]   I mean that it's not in the equation for them.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.040]   They don't believe it's their job to consider evil or not evil.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.760]   They just are doing what they do.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.240]   But do you think Leo, Zuckerberg, is sincere when he says
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.720]   that he sees a new world of people more connected?
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.880]   I'm not trying to get--
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.440]   No, and I think that's too much credit.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.600]   But again, I think that I don't see him as being purely
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.640]   cynical.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.160]   I don't know.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.720]   And I can't speak to his motivations because who knows?
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.200]   We don't know what his intent is.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.680]   We can't read it.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.880]   I mean, my suspicion is--
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   What's part of problem, thank you.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:20.200]   My suspicion is he's cynical and he doesn't really care.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.000]   But I don't know.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.240]   He may-- and it's a nice gloss to put-- oh,
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.400]   we just want to connect everybody.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.840]   It's a wonderful gloss.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.800]   Technology companies of late have gotten very good at glossing
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.640]   stuff that's good for them and couching it.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.800]   And I blame you, Doc, couching it in terms
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.920]   that are very positive.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.640]   They've learned the lingo of connection, conversation.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.840]   They read Clue Train.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.360]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.640]   The worst thing about the consequences of Clue Train
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.080]   is that we have oxymoronic conversational marketing.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.440]   We can talk at people now.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.440]   Yes.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.040]   We can call every damn thing there is a conversation
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.600]   and be no more personal than we were before.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.760]   And that's because these people are fundamentally tone deaf.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.800]   And so they don't--
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.120]   I think you're probably right.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.400]   They don't get what they're doing.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:10.720]   Go ahead.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.920]   I mean, they're--
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.160]   I just think-- I don't think, by the way, that Zuckerberg
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.200]   is a moral.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   I just think he's full of it.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.800]   And I think-- and delusional is maybe the wrong word,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.160]   but I think he's reading a lot of things wrong.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:31.640]   And I think every-- it's sort of the nature of large companies
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.080]   to want to take over as much as they can and control
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:34.960]   as much as they can.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.240]   I think Google, to a remarkable degree,
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.920]   is less inclined to do that than any other company
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.800]   that I know they're-- they get open source.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.040]   They get what the net is about.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   They come from that.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.920]   This is what Jeff's book is about.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.320]   And I think that that's the advantage there.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.920]   I don't think that--
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.080]   I agree with Gina, by the way.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.120]   I have the same fear that we're all
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:00.840]   going to start using some Facebook back end
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.800]   because that's the convenient thing to do.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.760]   And that has a lot of users and the rest of it.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.040]   But I think they're going to arc over.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.920]   I think that they're-- I think they're going to wear out.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.600]   And I think there's going to be any number of other things
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.160]   that come along that will be just as fashionable
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.440]   and just as interesting and move people away from it.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.840]   I mean, we were saying the same things about MySpace
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.240]   four years ago, five years ago.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.240]   And AOL and Yahoo and their--
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.240]   And AOL and Yahoo.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.080]   And they say it about Twitter now.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.200]   And about Twitter as well.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.520]   I think Twitter has a sense--
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.080]   some sense anyway of their place in the world.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:31.920]   And it's not only--
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.400]   That's the question.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.720]   When it's too late for them.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.160]   I think what I'm hearing here is Twitter--
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.520]   Twitter still has a chance to listen well and define evil.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.280]   And in fact, Ev talked about South West.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.960]   I'm getting a sense that it's too late for Facebook.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.400]   Now, the question is, some will say to you, Leo, OK fine.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:48.920]   So you leave.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.400]   There's 400 million, soon 500 million people there.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.920]   So we lost one.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.920]   Yeah, they could care less.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.960]   And I admitted I'm being a little grandstanding.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.400]   But I think it's important.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.080]   I'm going to talk about my radio show where I deal with much,
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.840]   much more normal users who have not considered any of this.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:09.040]   I mean, this is all way obstrus minutia to them.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.560]   It's not something--
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.240]   Is there any way that they could--
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.480]   because I would think that the investors in Facebook
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.960]   have to be upset about this too if they
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.560]   see the potential of a fall here?
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.000]   But there isn't going to be.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.960]   There's 400 million users.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.080]   That's what you're saying.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.000]   That was the case that Pete Rojas made when he left.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.040]   And I had a conversation with him on Twitter.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.880]   And he said that the fast growth masks the problem.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.000]   Oh, very good point.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.240]   And it's a really good point.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.120]   And it's happened with lots of companies.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.720]   And it goes to your tech point too,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.480]   that you don't notice there's a problem.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.720]   Because hell, man, we're growing like crazy 500 million people.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.720]   We're going to control the world.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.560]   Boy, that's a good point.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.240]   And there's something nagging there.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:52.320]   Yeah, and of course, we're the sand and the oyster that's
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   bugging it.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.760]   Let me read from Shrig's quote.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.480]   This is the one that you were referring to in the Times.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.240]   The Times Bits blog post is reader questions and then
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.080]   answers from Elliot Shrig.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.520]   The question from Abby Katz in New York,
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.200]   why not simply set up everything for opt-in rather than opt-out?
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.120]   Facebook seems to assume that users generally
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.200]   want all the details of their private lives made public.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.280]   Elliot's response, everything's opt-in on Facebook.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.160]   Participating in the service is a choice.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.120]   We want people to continue to choose Facebook every day.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.600]   Boy, that's a telling sentence.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.720]   I have a lot of use that voice in these moments.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.120]   Adding--
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.640]   You should read all sorts of use.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.360]   You should be soothed by what I'm saying.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.520]   We care.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.200]   You know what it is?
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.120]   It's the mortician's voice.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.960]   Adding information, uploading photos,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.360]   or posting status updates, or liking a page,
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.600]   they're all opt-in.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.040]   Please don't share if you're not comfortable.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.160]   That said, we certainly will continue
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.440]   to work to improve the ease and access of controls
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.640]   to make more people more comfortable.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.520]   Your assumption about our assumption is simply incorrect.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.080]   We don't believe that.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.840]   We're happy to make the record on that clear, huh?
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.480]   Nobody's making you smoke.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.720]   It's robotic.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.880]   It's robotic.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.200]   It's weirdly robotic.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.080]   So I'm getting more and more uncomfortable about all of this.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.640]   And here's what makes me uncomfortable.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.480]   Look, I'm smart enough to know that everything I post on Facebook
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.360]   is potentially public.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.440]   So I'm just going to only put stuff on there that's public.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.560]   In fact, that was the solution I came to last week.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.600]   I'm going to keep the account.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.120]   And just, it's public.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.200]   But then I realize there's a really insidious problem here.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.600]   If I use Facebook at all, whether it's
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.000]   as a public persona or as a private persona,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.880]   I'm coercing either my public or my friends to use Facebook.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.240]   Because the only way they can interact with me
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.280]   is by joining Facebook and participating.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.120]   So in a way, and we talked about Farmville,
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:59.040]   it's this coercion of social relationships.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.680]   I'm coercing people I'm in relationship with to--
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.880]   Girl Scout cookies.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.080]   Yeah, to do something bad.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.080]   To do something I know fundamentally is bad.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.920]   And it crystallized for me when I talked to my kids last night,
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.240]   18-year-old Abby and 15-year-old Henry.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.720]   What do you understand about Facebook and privacy in public?
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.360]   For instance, I said, Abby, you really
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.920]   should treat everything you post on Facebook as public.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.840]   Because ultimately, maybe you don't necessarily know.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.520]   And there's all sorts of issues.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.920]   And she says, no, no, no.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.280]   I put private stuff on there all the time.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.720]   And it's private.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.240]   And that really concerned me that even a sophisticated 18-year-old
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.360]   does not make that distinction and is not aware of the issues.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.720]   And so I decided I'd not want to be complicit in this, frankly.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.720]   What do you say to your kids?
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.080]   Will you no longer be able to spy on your 18-year-old
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.640]   if you--
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.520]   I do not have the password to her account,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.800]   although she foolishly often uses my computer and logs--
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.600]   she logs into Facebook on my computer.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.440]   And I always know she has because it's her pages in French
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.960]   because she's pretentious.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.920]   And so I know all--
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.560]   and there's Abby's page.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.640]   But I am very good and I don't look at it.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.160]   Do you spy on your kids' Facebook page, Ted Duck?
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.400]   I only found out he had a Facebook page.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.680]   And recently, he's 13.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.680]   He goes to a school that discourages the use of computers,
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.920]   even, and everybody in his class.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.120]   It's a Facebook account.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.280]   Of course they did.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.280]   There's huge benefits.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.560]   It's all very innocent stuff.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.480]   It's mostly where we're going to go hang out,
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.720]   or what do you do at the moment?
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.280]   Stuff like that.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.800]   So there's not-- in fact, I asked him, once I knew he was there,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.280]   I said, are you sure you want me to friend you here?
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.720]   Because I don't want to jump in on your private life.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.200]   He says, I don't care.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:46.920]   Really?
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.920]   I'm not allowed to be anywhere near them in any way.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.840]   Well, your special--
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.280]   Jake, your course is all too good at the privacy controls.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.160]   He knows what he's doing.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.360]   But Jake's a Facebook developer.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.680]   Jake's a Facebook developer.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.240]   Jake, I haven't-- I've got to quiz him more interview
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   on this, actually, for my book.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.200]   But he's kind of confused why people are so upset
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.160]   with Zuckerberg now.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.120]   He says, Facebook is-- you know, it kind of makes sense to him.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.800]   Well, makes sense.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.760]   Again, from a purely--
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.240]   Your business point of view makes sense.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.080]   I'm sophisticated.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.200]   I don't understand the controls for the life of me.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:19.520]   You know--
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.240]   That's the next question.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.000]   Do you think that now--
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.040]   If you don't understand the controls--
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:23.880]   Oh, my God.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.000]   Well, exactly.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.760]   It strikes me that no one could possibly
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.040]   understand what's going on here.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.880]   And by the way, try and find how you can deactivate easily.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.720]   It's in your settings.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.200]   Try to find a way to delete your Facebook account.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.320]   It's hard.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.160]   Well, Doc, you're doing VRM.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.400]   I mean, all the privacy controls in Facebook
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.360]   are basically their VRM.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.960]   So they have it.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.880]   But some would say it's obfuscated.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.800]   I mean, how do you deal with that kind of--
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.920]   If it were truly VRM, it would be something
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.800]   is common not only to Facebook, but to many other things.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.000]   That's a big one.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.960]   Open standards.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.440]   And by the way, I should put in a plug.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:03.280]   This is coming week just before Google I/O is something
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.720]   called the Internet Identity Workshop,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.560]   which I help organize.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.520]   It's at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.880]   And it's very much a past-to-hat-get-in kind of thing.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:17.280]   It's the 10th one of these Open ID OAuth microformats.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.160]   A lot of things like that were visited there,
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   incubated there, came out of there one way or another.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.560]   They're discussed all the time.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.480]   It moves identity forward every time we get together.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.120]   And they're Facebook people here, too.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.480]   But they're the geek ones.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.160]   And it's interesting to be some good--
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.040]   some really fine geeks have gone to work there
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.440]   and don't seem to feel morally compromised about it.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.800]   But we'll see.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.720]   But anyway, this--
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.680]   I was just doing a search on Google.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.320]   How do I--
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.040]   OK, how do I find my IP address, get a password,
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.400]   know if I'm pregnant, how do I love the number sixth item?
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.280]   Number five item.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.480]   How do I delete my Facebook account?
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:56.800]   That's awesome.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.400]   I love these Google Suggest games.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.760]   That's the dark thing that Jeff was talking about.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.000]   OK, that's the--
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.480]   That's quite-- that means a lot of people are searching, right?
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.480]   That is a pearl in an oyster right there.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.720]   That is definitely a pearl.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.440]   If you're going to do the history of Facebook,
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.840]   when did this moment come?
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.320]   Recently.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   It's just posted a while ago.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:15.800]   Recently.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.000]   It came with this last enough.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.920]   So it's jumped to shark.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.320]   There it is.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:20.840]   I don't care.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.280]   So it's 400 million people jump into shark all at once.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.360]   But they won't splash.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.480]   When is-- when Doc, when does a network effect become so
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.040]   potent, so powerful that you cannot overcome it,
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.320]   that it's done?
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.880]   I mean, yes, we're young--
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.360]   It's the direction.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.920]   So there's the network effect in the way up,
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.000]   but the one on the way down exists as well.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.520]   One, again, it's a Microsoft problem.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.960]   People go about Google as Microsoft.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.520]   No, Facebook is becoming a Microsoft.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.760]   It occurs to me here because we don't have alternatives.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.120]   As Eric Schmidt says, for every single thing that Google
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.200]   does, there is a perfectly good alternative.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.640]   Want to leave Google, go to Bing, you'll
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.160]   find knowledge in the world.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:53.600]   Right.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:59.360]   But Facebook, by trying to become the network of our
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.600]   identities and connections, you leave it, you leave all
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.680]   your identities and connections.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.280]   You leave your friends.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.880]   But do we already have an answer?
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.480]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.400]   And diaspora is-- I don't know if it's the right alternative.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.000]   In fact, I know we should get Ken Shebertson in here, who's
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.800]   our VP technology.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.600]   Because there are a lot of people in the open source
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.280]   community who say diaspora is exactly the wrong response.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.200]   I only found out about it yesterday.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.720]   I donated $100.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.280]   I donated $100.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.880]   I'm a cheap guy.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.200]   Well, whatever, the whole point is--
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.240]   The intentions are right.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.240]   The whole point-- the intentions are right.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.840]   But let's get Ken in here, because he does have something
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.160]   to say upon this.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.040]   If you go to Kickstarter.com, that's the donation site.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.760]   Diaspora is a Kickstarter project, which means they're
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.720]   saying, give us money.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.280]   Oh my god.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.720]   It was $20,000 yesterday.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.600]   Yeah, they're going to be delivering that.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.080]   Their goal was $10,000.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.360]   In less than a month, they got more than their goal.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.440]   Yesterday was $20,000.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.880]   Now $43,000 donated to--
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.800]   or pledged through Kickstarter.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.360]   These guys are just college kids.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.720]   They're going to-- from NYU's current Institute,
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.080]   they're planning to spend the summer building diaspora.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.160]   I think they have enough money to do that now.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.720]   So you need to track the growth of that number,
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.160]   along with the ranking of the Delete My Facebook account
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.120]   under Google.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.040]   I'm actually stunned, because that was $20,000 yesterday.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:28.480]   Is now $40--
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.160]   Good for them.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.400]   There is something going on.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.160]   They got a New York Times feature today.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:33.720]   Oh, there you go.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.800]   That's what's going on.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.720]   That's not to do with it.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.240]   Yeah, but what they're trying to do
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.760]   is create, in essence, the public Facebook, right?
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.320]   Where you control everything, and it's a seed.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.640]   And I kind of like that, but it's apples and oranges.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.480]   Well, can pull your mic in?
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.440]   Because Ken Sheppard's in here.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.840]   He's a developer, web developer.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.720]   I've known him for a long time.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.080]   And I'm at Bear hug camp when we were trying to get Twitter
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.560]   to open up.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.480]   And he's our new VP of engineering.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.240]   He's replacing Colleen, and he day now.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.360]   But you had a problem with the way diaspora is going about it.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.520]   Well, you see this quite often with the open source
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.400]   projects where-- and Kevin Marks is actually an IRC.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.760]   He'd know a little bit more about this than I do.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.560]   But you see this quite often where people look around
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.200]   and they see what open source projects are already
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.000]   out there, and they say, well, I don't
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.040]   see the project there that does exactly what I want it to do.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.520]   So I'm going to go start my own rather than
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.920]   running around new projects.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.080]   Right.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.560]   Rather than looking around and looking
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.760]   at what other projects are doing something similar to what
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.840]   I want or what other protocols are contributing to that.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.720]   It strikes me we probably should be
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:40.040]   looking for existing protocols that we could cobble together.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.880]   Gina, does that make sense?
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.840]   Yeah, I mean, it's often a better choice
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.480]   to reuse code that already exists, right?
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.440]   Because people have put in time and effort.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.840]   But it is true.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.640]   It is a problem with open source projects.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.440]   I think that people say, well, let me just start a new one
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   versus using one that's already out there.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:00.560]   I mean, I guess the question is, what's already out there
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.600]   that maybe this project could roll into or use on top of?
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.920]   I mean, Ken, do you want to--
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:06.720]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.720]   Yes, is there something like--
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.360]   I mean, identical?
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.320]   Is that a solution?
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:09.840]   Right.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.440]   I mean, identical Evan Padromos tried
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.920]   to do sort of the same thing back in July of what
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.000]   was it, 2008.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.400]   There's a little known project out there,
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.240]   I think, called Noserub.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.280]   It's another thing that's happening just started
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.960]   because there wasn't anything that they could find.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.440]   Kevin Marks and the activity streams work.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.280]   The streams.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.360]   The people who started--
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.160]   Seems like the pieces are out there.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.080]   Yeah, there's a DISO project that Kevin--
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.800]   Chris Messino started working on.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.440]   They mentioned in the Diaspora documentation
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.440]   that it wasn't going anywhere.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.880]   So we decided to start this project.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:48.000]   And I just find out that the Diaspora project isn't a project
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:48.520]   yet.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.520]   They're collecting money.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.440]   Because if we're guys saying, we want to do something.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.440]   Yeah, they're saying that if you fund us at this level--
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.920]   So maybe it's not too late.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.920]   Maybe it's not too late to say, guys, yeah,
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.000]   we gave you a lot of money.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.160]   But what we're saying is we're voting for an open alternative.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.760]   Maybe it's not from scratch.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.240]   Maybe it's combining all of these existing technologies.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.280]   Maybe it's more a movement than it is software.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.600]   Maybe we should volunteer to advise them.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.800]   Nothing they're going to have enough.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.280]   I don't know.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.760]   You guys know far better than I do.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.080]   Well, I volunteer.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.280]   I'll advise them.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:19.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.520]   I'm sure, Gina, you'd be glad that's our best.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.520]   Absolutely.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.160]   Absolutely.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.760]   There are a lot of parallels between this
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.920]   and what happened with identical and laconica,
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.880]   where Twitter was in this period where it was crashing
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.400]   all the time.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.600]   And people were upset with the fact
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.680]   that it was this closed system.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.360]   I was one of them.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.680]   I went there and to support them.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.560]   I don't use it.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.320]   People first went over to Jiku, and then they
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.800]   wandered over to identical.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.280]   And there's still lots of people are using identical,
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.800]   but it never got critical mass just because 90% of the people
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.440]   didn't know about it, didn't move over to it.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.080]   And now it's out there, but it's still--
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.000]   it's not challenging.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.840]   Twitter for my--
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:54.920]   So is the solution to push Facebook to back down,
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.720]   do opens stuff, participate in the community,
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.520]   not try to do a closed?
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.440]   Because is that even a doable strategy?
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.920]   I think so.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.160]   Maybe that's what we should be doing.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.880]   In the end, all these services end up
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.640]   trying to compete for page views and for ad impressions
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.400]   and trying to get people to sign up to use their UI
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.720]   and to use their service.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.240]   But it doesn't seem like there's a business model out there
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.560]   that allows people to go out and contribute to protocols
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.040]   and really altruistically work on a protocol
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.480]   and get these systems to connect.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.080]   They always end up saying, like the diaspora folks, oh, well,
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.520]   yeah, and in the end, we'll probably charge to host something
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   for you.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.280]   They want to do a hosted server, yeah.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.680]   And then they're going to start to kind of eat
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.200]   and try to--
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.400]   There's going to be another Facebook.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.920]   Is this is either donations.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.920]   Should this become a Mozilla identity?
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:42.800]   Well, there's--
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.280]   Interesting.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.880]   I really like what he's just saying about protocols
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.400]   because that's what we need.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.000]   And maybe the protocols are there already.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.440]   Are they or are they not?
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.560]   You know, we're going to get-- Chris, Chris
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.000]   going to be on next week because I think--
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:53.560]   Oh, so, yeah.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.040]   Yeah, I think Chris Messina is a good guy to talk about this.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.680]   Certainly, that's-- now he's at Google now,
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.560]   but he's been very involved in it.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.920]   Well, and Chris, and that's why he's doing it, actually.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.120]   David record on it at Facebook, who
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.840]   was very active in the community before going to Facebook.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.720]   These guys-- I may just be missing what they're saying
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.560]   now that they're in these larger companies,
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.120]   but they sort of fall off the map.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.240]   And all the efforts--
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.360]   Fred Fitzpatrick at Google now, who was building on--
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.400]   We also talked about Rick Clow, who's--
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.560]   He's going to be on, too.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.520]   --the manager for Google profile.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:24.920]   Right.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.880]   It's just hard to find a sustainable sort of critical mass
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.600]   of people who can do something outside of the sphere
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.840]   of influence of the Google or the Facebook
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.840]   or--
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.840]   Right.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:35.840]   And then--
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.320]   I think Kevin Marks stayed with it
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.880]   going both going in and out of Google.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.920]   I think his uplift remained pretty much the same.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:41.480]   I would agree.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.960]   It's one of the reasons we really like Kevin having one
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.440]   as much as we can, because I think he--
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.160]   There's three or four functions, aren't there?
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.960]   Here, if you try to start to separate it,
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.440]   there's an identity function, which
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.320]   is what you talked about a week ago with profile.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.560]   There's this publishing function of, here's my stuff.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:02.440]   There's a joining function of what are my connections to people.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.600]   And Facebook kind of try to bring them all together.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.360]   And that's probably the main problem they have.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.400]   It's like, what if GeoCities--
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.200]   It's like, what if GeoCities said, we're the web?
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.760]   And if you-- and somehow coerce people that everybody
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.040]   had to create a web page created on GeoCities,
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.080]   that wouldn't be a good thing.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.400]   Riley's kind of arguing that we have that kind of new OS
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.280]   fight going on and that in essence,
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.280]   Apple is competing to be the web.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:25.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.320]   I agree.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.920]   I think they all would like to, right?
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.680]   I'm sure Google-- well, maybe not.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.560]   That's a--
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.200]   Well, no, Google's following the same approach for Buzz,
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.400]   where they're saying we're going to support OAuth and Sam--
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.320]   That's why I like Buzz.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.120]   And they're just cobbles together, open protocols.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.880]   It will be nice when they actually roll that out.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.840]   They have to have an API.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.560]   People we should advise are Buzz.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.320]   And how would they get Buzz right?
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:48.680]   Maybe.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.840]   Because it ain't now.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.040]   Well, we're certainly rattling.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.240]   Ken, thank you for coming in.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.240]   We're certainly rattling the tree on this.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.000]   And we're going to take a break.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.600]   When we come back, I am going to press the button.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.720]   Delete my Facebook account.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   We can talk more about this.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.920]   There's gosh, there's so much news
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:05.240]   that we haven't even gotten to.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.040]   We'll get to as much as we can.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.000]   There's a Google Wave story from--
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.080]   Did you write this, Gina?
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   Which--
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   For Fast Company.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.600]   Of which one?
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.800]   The Fast Company, Google Wave.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.520]   Got its groove back.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.360]   I actually didn't add that to the front feed.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.800]   I'm not that self-promoting.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.520]   Well, I'll promote for you.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.840]   How about that?
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.440]   Thank you.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.480]   Before we go any farther, I do want
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:38.360]   to mention our friends at Citrix, the makers of GoToAssist.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.840]   If you're in the tech support industry, the business,
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:43.840]   if you have software, you support you're an IT person,
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.360]   maybe you're just the family geek
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:48.800]   and you support a lot of friends and family with PCs and Macs.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.320]   You should know about GoToAssist from Citrix.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.120]   It is simply the fastest, easiest way
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:57.200]   to do remote assistance.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.400]   Citrix does go to my PC.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.000]   That great remote desktop background
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.040]   they've got makes us such a fast and easy to use product.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.080]   Your family, your clients, your support ease
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.560]   don't have to have it installed ahead of time.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.040]   You send them a link, they click it.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.440]   It's downloads in a second, and now they're ready.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.560]   And you can get in there whether they're there or not.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.400]   They can give you the right to get in on a tenant,
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.280]   which is very nice.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.760]   You don't have to wait till your clients around
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.000]   to fix the computer.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.760]   You can have up to eight sessions at once,
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:26.640]   which means you could start a scanner, install,
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.000]   on the system and then move to the next and next while it's
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:29.960]   going on.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.920]   It gives you an assay of what software's running,
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.640]   including security software and operating system.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:38.320]   As I said, PC or Mac, you even have two-way screen sharing.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.960]   So you can show them what's on your screen if you want.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.040]   Integrated live chat.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.640]   So you can say, here's what I'm doing.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.440]   What was the symptom you had, that kind of thing.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.560]   Citrix is so great.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.000]   They've got all the data encrypted, of course,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.960]   using end-to-end 128-bit SSL.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.280]   There's free customer support 24/7.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.360]   That's for you.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:56.960]   Give it a try.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.640]   30 days free.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.240]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.960]   That's the URL.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:06.400]   G-O-T-O, assist.com/twig.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.440]   Citrix is a great supporter of this week in Google.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.320]   I guess they're a cloud product, aren't they, after all?
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.400]   So we're really glad to have their help
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.080]   keeping the show on the air.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.920]   And you can help us by going to go to assist.com/twig,
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.760]   help yourself, too.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.600]   We're talking about Facebook.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.440]   And I'm ready to pull the plug.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.840]   Before you delete it, there's one person IRC who said,
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.240]   everybody should leave their Facebook profile saying,
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.920]   you can now find me over these other places.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.200]   In other words, you're the main area.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.920]   But a pointer to your Twitter.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.000]   Maybe I should do that, huh?
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   You think instead of deleting it?
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.400]   Don't slow me down.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.000]   I was on a roll.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:42.800]   Well, good.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:42.800]   Well, good.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.320]   It's in there too.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:43.800]   It's in there.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.920]   No, no, don't jump.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.760]   Don't jump.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.840]   With building an open Facebook, there's
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.600]   the issue of consuming and publishing open protocols,
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.960]   right, using open protocols.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.280]   So then there's this issue of federation, right?
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.360]   So if I understand it, right, Diaspora
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.640]   gives you an installable application
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.120]   that you can put on your own web server
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.640]   and host your own data, right?
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.280]   And that's not something that most Facebook users are going
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.080]   to do.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.840]   So it really has to be Facebook, which is this service,
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.760]   which anybody can join.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.280]   It is free.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.520]   And you don't need a web server.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.120]   You don't just have to understand what a web server is.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.040]   But then there has to be this other option where you can--
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:21.120]   so we're talking about federation and open protocols.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.620]   Yes.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.000]   And so others can come along and find
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.280]   a business opportunity in creating
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.600]   the red herring of--
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   you know, we don't know.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.800]   Red hat of Diaspora.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.920]   Red herring was a magazine.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.240]   We don't want a red herring.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.240]   We don't want a red hat.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:36.740]   Right.
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:37.240]   Right.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.520]   And that's a tough business model.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.040]   I mean, WordPress does it, right?
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.320]   They have the hosted service, and they have--
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:44.820]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.560]   And they benefit from all the work that goes on.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.680]   And I talked to Polaris, the investors,
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.520]   when they did that deal, and only echoed what Mark was saying.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:56.320]   But leave the open open, and you're going to benefit.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.160]   And yeah, you're the first to build on top of it.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.080]   You'll get the advantage of doing that.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.240]   But you'll also get the advantage of the platform being
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.120]   trusted and added to.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:09.320]   If Facebook had any damn sense, they'd
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.720]   open source the things that are most bothering us.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.240]   I guess all right.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.240]   I guess you--
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.240]   I shouldn't delete it.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:17.600]   You're right.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.000]   I should probably just--
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.560]   I wish I could get rid of all the content,
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.320]   except for one wall post saying, I'm not here.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:24.880]   I'm not here.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.080]   You shouldn't be here either.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.920]   Come sign me here.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.400]   How long before Facebook deletes that one?
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.600]   Oh, Liam, could you create a new identity on Facebook?
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.520]   That's what you do.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.520]   Leo2.0.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.440]   That's what you do.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:38.760]   OK.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.960]   So I delete it, and then come back at some point.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.800]   I thought I'm trying to convince you to jump here.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.520]   I don't--
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.680]   The IRC wants you to delete it, by the way.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.680]   There's a--
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.320]   The chat room is chanting delete delete delete delete.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.240]   Delete delete delete delete delete.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.960]   The street below.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:52.600]   Yeah, they--
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.000]   So I did that Google search.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.880]   I want to see you through the corups of Facebook.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:56.440]   I will do it.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:56.440]   I will do it.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.720]   I'll have the balcony.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.480]   I did that delete-- that the Google search in WikiHow
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:03.800]   yesterday posted a very good article on how to permanently
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.000]   delete a Facebook account that talks about some important
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.160]   steps, like make sure you remove your Facebook connect
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:09.640]   logins.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.880]   If you've been using that exclusively on sites like dig.com,
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:18.000]   you want to create an account because you'll lose that account.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.160]   They also give you a direct link to a page that is hidden deep
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.040]   within Facebook.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.520]   The delete account form.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.120]   And you won't see this unless you really know where you're
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:29.680]   going.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.600]   If you do not think you will use Facebook again and would
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.360]   like your account deleted, I'm sorry, Dave.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.560]   I can't do that.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.320]   We can take care of this for you.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.800]   Keep in mind you will not be able to reactivate your account
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.160]   or retrieve any of the--
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.760]   you know, they really act like you're going to do something
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.520]   significant, right?
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.280]   And I'm going to just quickly--
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.960]   you're about to-- you sure?
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.000]   I'm going to just in case you're a robot.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.280]   I'm going to--
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.720]   actually, what do I care if you get my password?
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.880]   I'll type in my--
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.160]   let's come to think of it.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.800]   Actually, you don't want people to get your password
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.960]   because it's--
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.720]   it's only going to burn the witch.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.160]   Yeah, burn the witch.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.840]   You remember there was a Saturday in the live early on
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.800]   where the audience decided whether to kill Larry the lobster.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   I feel like this is it.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.800]   This is Larry going in the pot right now.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:16.920]   [SINGING]
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.560]   By the way, they say you have two weeks to change your mind.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.160]   We're only going to deactivate it.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.360]   And if you do anything, then in any way
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:27.440]   touches your account, we're back.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.160]   So I should really just change the password.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.680]   Don't like anything.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.680]   You can't like anything.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.040]   You can't use Facebook Connect.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:37.360]   You can't in any way accidentally log in because it'll say, oh,
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.600]   see, we knew.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:39.280]   We knew.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.160]   OK, there we go.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:43.800]   Your account now has been deactivated
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.000]   and will be permanently deleted within 14 days.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.840]   If you log in, your account will be reactivated
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.840]   and you'll have the option to cancel your request.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.480]   So there you go.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.600]   It's like we have to start sitting shiva for you.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.440]   So that's it?
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.280]   It's gone.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.760]   Yeah, and I think that's the right thing to do.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.560]   And I think you're right.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.120]   What I will do is create a Leo Laporta account sometime
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.120]   down the road.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.720]   There are already fan pages to say,
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.560]   I don't do Facebook.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:07.200]   Here's why you shouldn't and see on my blog.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.200]   Is the blog the right answer, the personal blog,
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:13.560]   is that the right place to start controlling your identity?
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:17.800]   Well, it's certainly the best place to express yourself
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:21.240]   in something longer than 140 characters,
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:23.040]   which it always has been.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.080]   I mean, I think a blog is simply a publication.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:28.440]   Controlling your identity, I think, is a different thing.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:32.480]   I think there's a-- you need a kind of a dashboard
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.320]   or some kind of a context for doing that.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.680]   And it has to be open source.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:39.400]   It has to be something that can be universally used,
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.680]   or at least that the metal level can include a number
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.000]   of different approaches to doing that.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.400]   What do you think about Google profile doc?
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.640]   I mean, we talked about that.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.200]   I don't know what I've forgotten.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.680]   So I'm the wrong guy.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.600]   I use that.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.200]   And as Jeff pointed out, if it showed up
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.960]   at the top of the Google search for me, I'd be--
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:56.840]   Which was your idealio?
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.360]   Perfectly happy.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.880]   I think that's why having Rick Clow on it
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.720]   can be really interesting and see if he can talk.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.800]   He's the new product manager.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.440]   And see what they're thinking at Google.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.680]   Because this is their opportunity now.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.560]   They've got an opening.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.960]   They've been nowhere on social, nowhere on identity.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.800]   And the question is, what can they do right?
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.160]   Right.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.920]   And one of the questions that I did ask myself about this
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.800]   is, do I get benefit from Facebook that I'm giving up?
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.880]   What is the intangible benefit?
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.960]   And can that be transferred to another outlet?
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.320]   And because 400 million people use Facebook,
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.600]   people are trying to find me.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.320]   But this is exactly the problem I have.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.040]   I think Twitter is my new Facebook.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.160]   Pretty much.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.680]   I want Google to be.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.400]   So do you want people to go to Facebook to find you
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.840]   or go to Google to find you?
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.280]   Google, web search.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.440]   Just web search identity.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.280]   That's why identity is different from your public.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:48.800]   Exactly.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.320]   Your publics.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.520]   Making you work.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.960]   Because, you know, let's get too far,
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.520]   which is what I do for a living.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.520]   If the family is dead, we create new families at Facebook.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.040]   We decide what to do as a family.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.000]   That's what that is.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:01.480]   No interesting.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.520]   Identity is an entirely different thing.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.160]   It is your identity to the world.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.920]   And Facebook's big mistake, I think, in the end,
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.800]   was to try to mix the two.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.160]   Because your identity is what you give to the whole world.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.920]   Your publics, your limited publics, your families,
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.440]   are what you feel safe in.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.640]   And you need control over both.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.240]   So the other mistake Facebook made was by saying,
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:27.920]   don't worry.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.720]   We're just going to gather all this stuff and share it for you.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.160]   What do you say to people-- and I get calls like this
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.680]   on the radio show a lot-- who say, well, if you Google me,
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.280]   you get all sorts of awful stuff.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.080]   Or what if your name is John Smith?
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.400]   Well, that's Google's opportunity,
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.240]   is to have you take over your identity and who could
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.080]   become the verifier of identity.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.560]   That's a huge job.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.160]   Some have said over the years, the post office should do it.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.120]   Should banks do it, I don't think anymore.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.480]   Could Google do it?
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.280]   Is there a way-- Twitter is actually
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.440]   the one organization that does now verify identities.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.160]   But don't dare change your profile,
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.040]   because I was verified and then changed the bio.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.240]   And I'm not unverified.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.080]   And that's been a month.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.160]   I unverified myself by changing.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.280]   No, I think truth is we have the fake Leo here today.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.000]   Ha ha, you'll never know.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   You'll know.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.280]   I deleted his account.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.720]   He's gone.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.360]   And I'm in charge now.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.160]   So this is so Leo.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.680]   One of the guys in the IRC is wondering
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.480]   how many fake Leo's will now show up.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:28.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.120]   There are other Leo report pages and stuff.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.600]   There was a fake Leo for a long time.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.280]   But I still think the web page rules all, right?
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.840]   So I decided to set up my own web page and code it by hand.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.920]   You could use a page that Google profile is created for you.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.360]   Even Facebook creates a public page.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.440]   I think the reality is that we all should say,
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.920]   everyone in the world is going to have a web page hosted
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.680]   wherever they want to choose--
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.600]   they choose to host it.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.840]   Facebook is a choice, right?
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.960]   Because it does create a public facing page that defines you.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.360]   And that the way that you find people
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.480]   is through searching the web for that page.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.560]   And a blog is a particularly good solution
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.720]   for establishing your identity, especially for someone,
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.800]   like John Smith, who says, all this junk comes up for me
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:16.760]   because blogs are really good food for search engine robots
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.720]   and will get pages with your name to the top of the search
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.280]   results just by virtue of the fact that they update a lot.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.880]   It does have to be something that everybody uses, right?
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.640]   I mean, that's the reason Facebook has this power.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.440]   Well, no, it has to be something you can find from anywhere,
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:31.960]   right?
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:37.000]   So I can create my own canonical page about me and Google,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.720]   if it's somewhere, anywhere, it's my blog.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.440]   You search for me.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.640]   I think Buzz machine comes up first,
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   and that's exactly what it does.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.000]   But you're giving a lot of power to Google,
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.800]   because if that thing does not exist on Google,
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.280]   then you don't exist.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:47.800]   Right.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.600]   Well, any search engine, replace Google with--
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.600]   Any search engine, maybe, but--
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.480]   But you can't replace Google with any search.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.040]   That's the point, is that Google is--
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:54.640]   Well, yes, you can.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.000]   Can you?
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:55.760]   In the lower end.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.720]   The important thing is substitutability in economic systems.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.920]   I guess that's what you were saying.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.440]   Google, at the search level, is it's already substitutable.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.200]   It's not--
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.080]   My Google profile page is better.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:09.600]   It's actually better.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.320]   It's actually better.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.880]   Google's profile page is worthless.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.160]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.400]   Right?
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.000]   I wonder if my Google profile page comes up on Bing.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.720]   It doesn't come up on Google.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.800]   Wouldn't it be funny if it came up on Bing, but not Google?
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.440]   Yeah, it doesn't seem to come up on Bing either.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.200]   I mean, the thing is, how to search engine
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.600]   to discover pages in bound links, right, generally.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.040]   I mean, do you link Google profiles?
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.960]   There are changes that my blog gets links
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.280]   because it's in conversation.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.200]   My identity page would get no links
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.400]   because it's rather static.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.080]   It just says, hi, I'm Jeff.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.640]   So that's why Google has to change its view of--
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.160]   I get identity.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.960]   And there's so many people who are doing so much more
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.240]   than this than I do.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.720]   Creating things like OAuth and all that.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.320]   But identity is a different world from publishing.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.440]   And a different world from creating societies,
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.000]   publics, whatever you want to call it.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:25.120]   Is res
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.720]   for some reason, mine's not on there at all.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.680]   Maybe because--
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.200]   By the way, there's breaking news that Eric's saying
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.400]   who of Google running Android is going to Facebook.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.600]   Oh, great.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.680]   Wow.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.320]   What was his position at Android?
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.200]   They said, chief, I don't think he's that.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.040]   But I don't know.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.120]   I don't know.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.040]   Eric's--
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.320]   Oh, one man.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.000]   The other Jeff Jarvis, I being the Jeff Jarvis.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.720]   The other Jeff Jarvis, the jazz musician,
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:00.280]   the one with talent, is number one on Bing.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.280]   Jeff--
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.280]   That pisses me off.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   That's really bad.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.280]   That's bad.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.280]   Squared the baby.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.000]   Because we get Google listeners where we all sit around
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.320]   and Google ourselves.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320]   That's so sad.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320]   That's so sad.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.840]   Eric, by the way, was senior product manager for Android.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:20.280]   So a fairly high up Android going to Facebook.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.320]   So maybe Facebook's going to make a phone.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.320]   Or maybe Facebook's going to make a phone.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.320]   Yeah, of course they will.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.320]   Of course they will.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.320]   Of course they will.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.400]   Would they make an Android phone?
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.400]   Would they make--
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.880]   It'll look like that Borg thing.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.560]   Resistance is futile.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.520]   Oh, I got my Facebook phone.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.640]   How do you like it?
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.720]   That's great, isn't it?
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.560]   You'll never get one now.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.960]   No, I don't get a Facebook--
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.960]   You know, and that's the other thing is there
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.040]   is this social coercion.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.520]   I expect pressure from my family and friends.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.720]   Why aren't you-- what happened?
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.040]   We can't find you anymore.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.640]   You don't exist for us anymore.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.480]   But I think that's when you-- those are the times
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.320]   you really have to start to fight when
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:06.080]   it's that kind of situation.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.160]   I think we should wrap it on that note.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.680]   There are a lot of other stories.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.960]   We're going to have a lot more to talk about, obviously,
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.360]   next week, Google I/O. And we will report right after the keynote
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.400]   and let you know what's going on with the Google.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:25.200]   Meanwhile, before we go, I had time for our tool number
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.400]   and tip of the week, starting with Gina Trapani
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.520]   in our tip of the week.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.000]   Really simple, short, easy one.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:32.480]   How does the--
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.960]   In Facebook page.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.800]   How does the Facebook page--
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.960]   I'm actually going to-- it's actually
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.880]   going to be a Google thing.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.280]   We talked about Facebook a lot this year.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:39.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.040]   Let's do something Google-like.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.000]   We're going to get complaints.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.080]   The irony is Facebook's not a cloud.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:44.640]   It isn't.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.320]   But it--
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:45.800]   It isn't.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.560]   It does tie in a little bit to our main side.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.480]   It interacts.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   It does.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.000]   It does.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:50.760]   It does.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.240]   It does.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:55.640]   You can now drag and drop images into Gmail by default.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.040]   Chrome only, but other browser support is coming.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.000]   So I love this.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.800]   I love this because back in, I don't know, whatever, two years
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.520]   ago, when everyone was talking about when are we going to move
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.120]   to web apps?
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.120]   Well, you can drag and drop files into web apps.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.320]   Well, now you can.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.520]   And so with Gmail right now, if you're running Chrome,
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.000]   I believe it's Windows only.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.960]   I actually didn't try it on my Mac.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:18.040]   Just drag and drop images right from your file system
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.200]   into your compose window.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.160]   And I believe you can even resize them before you send.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.040]   So which is sweet.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.960]   It just launched this week.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.760]   I use Chrome.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.800]   I have to say more and more and more.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.640]   I'm really liking it.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.920]   It's fast.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.160]   It's got enough extensions now that I don't feel like I'm
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.520]   missing anything in Firefox.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.840]   Firefox is getting slower.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.880]   Yeah, it is.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.720]   You know who's the winner is?
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.280]   WebKit.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.560]   WebKit's the winner, right?
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.680]   That's the engine behind it.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.600]   Thank you, Apple and Linux Geeks.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.200]   What do you know?
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.600]   Because it's the K engine, isn't it?
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:56.200]   By the way, I just installed Ubuntu Lucid Links on the
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:56.960]   MacBook.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.240]   And it's the best install I have ever done, highly
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.800]   recommended it.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.640]   This is a Samsung NC20.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.960]   It's a fairly generic atom-based netbook, but it saw
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.360]   the camera.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.920]   It saw the Bluetooth, saw the Wi-Fi.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.560]   I've never yet installed Linux without having to do a
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.240]   little broad-com chip hacking or something.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.840]   It was like Windows-- it was better than the Windows.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.840]   Really fast.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:17.440]   It works great.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.280]   It's beautiful.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.200]   I think Ubuntu-- I think Canonical has done a very good
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.200]   job of making Ubuntu the desktop Linux.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:26.680]   That's great.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.200]   And the laptop Linux, which is pretty amazing.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.800]   To run on a netbook just--
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.720]   Yes.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.920]   There is not a white box laptop.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.480]   I mean, it's--
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:34.800]   Right.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.800]   They're all something.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:36.240]   There's a desktop.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.080]   They're all a little different.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.320]   And partly because Microsoft made them that way.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.000]   You know, they do all this custom work with all these
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.320]   different makers.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.840]   And now, maybe they've stopped doing that.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.280]   That's the only reason why.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.040]   Maybe they would have--
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:47.640]   I would love it if you didn't--
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.600]   You're the art box, yeah.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.160]   The Chrome OS date.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.480]   That was interesting.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.080]   I was just about to say, I wonder what's going to happen
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.080]   to you on Linux.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.040]   Chrome OS.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:58.480]   Chrome OS.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.400]   Haven't heard a lot about Chrome OS in a while.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.400]   Be interested to see if I--
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.920]   Could it be the wave of OS's?
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.320]   Sorry, kid.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.040]   Aw.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.800]   Well, I'm sorry, because we got Android and the portable
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.600]   devices moving up with a tablet almost to a netbook.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.560]   Then we've got--
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.080]   Number.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:13.480]   Number.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:13.960]   Number.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:14.440]   Number.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.360]   Let's get the number.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.760]   Thank you, Gina, for your tip.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.080]   I'm almost--
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.400]   Oh, I'm verging.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.240]   I almost did it.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.120]   He almost did it.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   The number is 28, which is the market share
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.840]   that Android had in the first quarter of sales beating
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.600]   the iPhone with 21%.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.120]   Wow.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:31.840]   Android 28%.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.520]   But Blackberry is still 36% in the first quarter,
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.600]   according to NPD group.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.560]   If you look at the graph, though, Blackberry is kind of
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.240]   plummeting.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.520]   Is that worldwide or is that--
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.360]   You're not US.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.560]   You're not US.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.080]   USO.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.560]   Your worldwide numbers are very different.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.320]   It's a gut check.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.000]   It's like everybody in the world doesn't have an iPhone
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:52.760]   and uses Gmail.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:53.200]   You know what I mean?
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.320]   Everyone buys Blackberry's and uses Hotmail,
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.680]   but in our little geek world, it's Android versus iPhone.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.440]   Do you--
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.720]   That's pretty interesting.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.320]   It's huge.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.800]   Do you think that that's because there's a saturation
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.880]   that the iPhone is saturated the marketplace?
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.680]   I think it's part of it.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.840]   Certainly, yeah.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.320]   And I think it shows Google's strategy that the more
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.920]   devices you get on, the more Android will just grow.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.800]   Well, that's the strength, isn't it?
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.520]   I mean, you have some really good choices of phones now.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.160]   Really remarkable.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.760]   And other devices, too.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.520]   The wepad that I was trying to see in Berlin
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:33.400]   that I didn't see has now changed its name to the wepad.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.120]   And it's now for sale on Amazon Germany.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.120]   We're going to see more and more and more devices.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.760]   You saw them when you were in Vegas, Leo.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.160]   I think we're going to see more and more.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:43.840]   And that is--
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.440]   There's been a set up when we were in Davos.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.840]   That's his strategy.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.240]   I imagine it won't be too long before I have a WebOS
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:55.160]   tablet, an Android or maybe Chromium tablet, and an iPad.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.080]   Side by side, and I think they'll be fairly comparable.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.520]   It'd be very interesting to see who's the winner there.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.320]   The app store is going to be a big part of that.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.480]   It really is about apps.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.160]   That's the number 28.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.000]   Pretty good number.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   28.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   28.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.720]   My tool of the week, I should say.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.160]   And by the way, I should give a thanks to a listener.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.080]   Abdul Rahman Al-Kordiri--
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.560]   I hope I'm saying your name right-- Abdul Rahman--
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.040]   Google Insights for Search.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.160]   This is really intriguing to look at your search terms.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.840]   You can do comparisons and get all sorts of drill down,
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.120]   all sorts of information.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.520]   This is twit.tv over the last five years.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.320]   On the number of times that that term has been used in search,
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:46.400]   where it's being used, very interesting stuff.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.160]   You can add commas to add comparison items.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.200]   So compare it to a twit.tv to say revision three, our arch
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.760]   rival.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.920]   You could do a comparison between the two of us.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.440]   I guess they're not such an arch rival after all.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.120]   And--
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.000]   Somebody just said that Zuckerberg is the tool of the week.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   Zuckerberg!
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   Oh!
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   I love it.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.520]   Google.com/insights.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.120]   And we'll get an honorary tool of the week
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.800]   from the chatroom at Doc Serals, Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.320]   Doc, it's so great having you on.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.680]   We've got to get you on more.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.080]   I just think the world of you-- we thank you for Clue
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.200]   Train, which changed the world and for VRM, which
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:29.960]   is changing the world.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960]   A few other guys, too.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.440]   David and everybody else.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.960]   But Doc, it's just great to have you on.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.440]   Doc.serals.com.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.040]   Don't be a stranger.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.480]   Gina Trapani is at smarterwhere.org.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.120]   That's her blog.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.880]   Always good stuff there.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.880]   You're blogging a lot.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.120]   I love it.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.440]   And she's also the author of the Complete Guide to Google
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.480]   Wave, at completewaveguide.com, available now.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.880]   And working on Think Tank.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.960]   Yes.
