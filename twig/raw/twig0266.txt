[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.360]   Uh, we talked about it a little bit before but I think going in depth is gonna be fun with you
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.200]   Yeah, and I've been playing with it
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.960]   So uh, we should also uh welcome then uh our indy web guests from formerly known as idno. It's now called known
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.720]   Then word molar and uh erin joe richy

[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.120]   And i've been playing with with known
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.960]   And uh, am a quite a fan. So uh, let's do the unboxing uh by and by the way, uh, please
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.760]   Ben and erin just jump right in any you you're you're now guests not guests in the sense that we're
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   You're gonna interview you're part of the show you're panelists on the show so awesome participate as you wish
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.840]   Uh, jeff has a box. He has a box cutter and he is about to unveil
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.840]   A paper cut no something very exciting. I think
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.040]   No packing material. Yes, it's a round box ladies and gentlemen and inside the round box
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.040]   A little black watch so this was a Jason
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.960]   I reason I kind of knew what it was because Jason howl got his two you guys went to google.io
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.240]   And at google.io you got to choose between the lg and the sam san watches and then we're told
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.840]   That uh down the road that sometime you'd get a moto 360 and there it is
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.480]   There it is from moto roller. It's kind of funny because you feel like
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.800]   All of these watch companies need to get it in before apple
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.640]   And now they're watching then now that i've seen the apple watch which by the way the name of the apple watch is watch
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.920]   Uh now that i've seen the apple watch yep
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.840]   Pretty
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.280]   You're gonna it takes a little time to set it up mine was not fully charged out of the box
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.360]   So I had to plug it in let me show you the charger though while you're unboxing yours
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.160]   Um, and again, this is this is jason's so first of all it's the first
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.400]   Smartwatch and red wear watch that actually looks like a watch with a round face a lot of people have complained about the
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.320]   Uh the round face because it's the flat tire at the bottom
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.400]   But you know, you know, especially with a black type of face
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.920]   You don't you don't see that if you if you tap the watch you can see it when you
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.800]   There's it's not too bad. That doesn't bother me. The bigger question on this is going to be
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.680]   Oh, and by the way, I'm dictating to it right now
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.120]   The bigger question on this is going to be a battery life
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.520]   And responsiveness I fix it tore it down and they say it's a four-year-old
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.600]   Uh, ti o map system on a chip a very old one
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   Not a particularly low power one in that battery life on this watch some have complained the bird said was not even a full day
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.080]   And the anacos had his for a little bit longer
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.320]   And he says he's getting about 19 hours. We'll see that'll be the most interesting thing
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.840]   But I do like the way you you charge it it comes with this uh dock
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.640]   You know the the others the same sign the lg have have kind of a flat thing you snap it into with pogo pins and it charges
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.440]   This is an inductive wireless charger and it sits right here in the wireless charger
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.960]   Presumably on your bedside and then it does rotate. Oh, it's not plugged in so it's not going to do it
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.120]   But when it's plugged in it will rotate and show you the time
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.560]   Signals so that's so it's nice. It becomes a bedside clock. There's the two together
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.600]   There's jeff. Yeah, nice
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.800]   It's gonna watch is all the way up. It's our I should I should go I should go out the street this way
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.760]   She saw something right there that the the moto x fades out to save battery fades out five seconds
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.920]   After you flip it up the lg which are you wearing the lg or the samson?
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.120]   I'm wearing the lg the lg the lg which I have also
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.480]   Stays on like dims, but it stays on
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.400]   And gets a full day and I think this is maybe because of the battery weakness on this watch that it
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.040]   It turns itself also. I was that um, I just got back from e5
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.440]   In Berlin. I was speaking of e4 pruce, which was a good event first time
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.880]   They've had talks and stuff and I went up and saw the lg
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.000]   Uh, there's another lg round one. That's pretty the r
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.240]   Which is really nice and it has the thing I leo and I can't remember what you call it
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.640]   but like a diver's watch around thing and that hides the
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.720]   the
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   Mechanics that are in the flat tire. Let's ask the cantor bridge or maybe he'll know
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.240]   I
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.880]   Bezel I think but I was in a bezel. What is it? It's a I would have to ask my wife
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.560]   Because she's the one who's actually was the jeweler. So she would know oh
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.120]   I was watching
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.360]   Um, yeah, it looks pretty nice. I have to say
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:47.920]   It does it does is it a tacky meter? That's what Joel says, but how that sounds?
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.360]   Attacking me because if it's the cat if it's the calculator thing
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.480]   The anatomy of watch of course chat has a an illustration. What is the ring? It's the it does call the bezel
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:05.920]   Bezel or dial ring or the dial ring. I think the dial ring is on the face itself rings the numbers
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.560]   That's the best bezel with the bezel
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get okay. Oh nice nice
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.560]   Try to read whatever points to Cambridge
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.360]   the bezel
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   Rotating you need directional rotating bezel. Huh? Why why does it rotate? What do you do with it?
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.600]   diving and timing functions. Yeah, some watches the uh, they're for pilots. You can calculate how much gas you'll have left
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.240]   Oh, I'll do that. It's a kid. So it's kind of almost like a slide rule. It's a calculating thing
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.880]   Although if it's just timing then you would just put you know
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.080]   But anyway, oh this ridiculous. We've spent way too much time on something completely irrelevant
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.760]   And this is my problem with watch the whole watch conversation anyway
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.440]   The smartphone meant people could finally get rid of that thing on their wrist
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.560]   And how manufacturers are trying to put it back on our wrists and we say no
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:04.160]   I think a great tweet I saw yesterday said well now the device I no longer use to tell what time it is is tied to the device
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   I no longer use to cut people if
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   I'm sorry. I can't give credit work. It was right. All right. Yes. So we'll have uh next week. We'll have uh
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.280]   You know, it's funny because I took it out and I and I said wow
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.200]   That's pretty and I immediately ordered one that's two to three weeks back ordered now
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.480]   Which is better than it was you can't actually order that google.com
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.920]   Because I was thinking that you know apple pre-announcing this would basically tank
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.760]   Every motor over and everybody else is sales of watches over christmas because everyone would be waiting for the apple one
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.160]   But maybe the other way around they've seen the apple one and get the apple one but I can get one
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.360]   Yeah
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.240]   Apple in a way that does doesn't it validates the category?
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.760]   So okay, and I won't be able to get it to some unknown time in 2015 so
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.400]   And I think the apple one
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.960]   looks like such a rube goldberg
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:56.080]   It looks like a a a metal pillow on your wrist with with a button and a dial. It's like
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.760]   Yeah, why have the the buttonless company has the
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.440]   I think apple
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.920]   Contrary to what we were all hoping which is that apple would solve this wearable conundrum
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.080]   Uh apple's gone the opposite direction. They have little icons on the screen. They're tiny
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.960]   Looks like you've got a honeycomb on your screen. You're supposed to navigate that
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.840]   Yeah, I don't want a navigable watch the watch is there to give me alerts that are
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.040]   supplementary to my phone and I find that all the time
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.360]   I was sitting in some place and I needed to get ahold of somebody and I saw the SMS come in on my
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.400]   On my watch look at that interface. That's crazy
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   and then
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.480]   Uh after everybody kind of widely agrees around is the way to go. It's why the moato 360 sold out so fast
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.000]   It's what the lg is doing with the are apples declared. No. No, you know what
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.400]   A rounded pillow shaped rectangle. That's what you really want
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.680]   Oh, and by the way
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.200]   You can you can draw pictures and send it to somebody else
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.120]   On your watch you can tap it send strange emoticons
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.800]   I think I you know after thinking about this for a little bit
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.000]   This watch is designed for japanese school girls
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.360]   This is the this is the this is a watch
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.240]   I swear to god
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.120]   Oh, I don't want to functionality in the watch. Oh, this is good thumbnails of your picture the size of uh
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:22.000]   It's only 320 by 320. This is not like they said retina, but come on. It's 320 by 320. It's not
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.720]   Um
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.840]   Hey
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.080]   And just what I want to map on my watch
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.920]   I don't know
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.280]   It has something they called taptic not haptic taptic feedback. Oh, look you could set the date. Whoa
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   Whoa
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:50.080]   Atomic clocks you don't need to set the date well, then they made the first thing they said is we consulted horological experts
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:56.720]   To find out what people wanted when to watch and this watch is set automatically to the atomic clock
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.760]   I love atomic clocks. I do too, but you know what every smart watch
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.640]   That this is the feature
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.480]   That's the feature
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.360]   So well erin joh, do you think this is it? This is the watch for you?
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:36.400]   Uh, I don't know. I mean, I'm wearing the basis watch together. I like the basis watch. That's a health
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.280]   A couple of days before I have to charge it. I just forget to charge it. Um, well, that's to me
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.400]   That's why any watch one day is all it needs is one day you're going to charge it every night anyway, right?
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   But I don't charge the basis that night because it has the sleep tracker data
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.000]   So I wear it and unless I remember to take it off when I'm at my desk not doing anything and charge it
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.320]   Which I usually don't
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.280]   Then the battery dies you can see the you should try the I think it's called sleep at android
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:10.000]   Yeah, I love that phone on your bed, but but Jeff you can now use your watch for that. You do that too
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.080]   I do that. I have that the the iPhone app that I love. I've been using it for years that and
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.520]   A couple other things so it's a little crowded in your bed is what you're saying
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.240]   There's lots of sleep tracking things that I've experimented with here is by the way. I just want to show you so
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:32.160]   This is a nano watch. This is this is the thing that started this whole silly category
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.360]   It's an iPod nano in a special band. Remember it was a kickstarter project
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.560]   That's in the end. This is exactly
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.280]   same
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.480]   As everything else in fact it looks a lot like the new apple
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.960]   Tettles nice and it holds your music
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.160]   Yeah, so
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.480]   Uh, I don't know
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.720]   It's very much like the other watches
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.600]   Look at that. I don't want to stay on apple for too long. But but since I was traveling I couldn't hear you one sunday
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Uh or yesterday whatever the hell it was. I'm
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.640]   It's Tuesday. I don't know where I am. What did you think of the rest of the phone announcements on the paper?
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.200]   No, it's it's a new iPhone. It's huge. It's really interesting
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.840]   I think really the thing to take away from the apple announcement is this is Tim Cook's first
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.840]   He's finally out from under the ghost of Steve Jobs. This is his first new product category
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.840]   He and that's two new product categories
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.160]   Not just the apple watch but also apple pay which may be more significant
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.760]   um
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.600]   As as many android fans pointed out apple and that's nothing that hasn't been on android for some time
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.240]   in some cases for years
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.800]   um, but because it's apple, you know, they
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:47.840]   They're not they don't need a hurry and they can uh spend some time and get it right and I think the apple pay thing particularly
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:54.480]   Uh is going to bring some clout to the marketplace. I do believe this is the beginning of the end of the credit card enough uh of cash
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:01.440]   Long last last yeah, so it's just at the end of cash, but I think it's it is potentially the end of the credit card
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.600]   Um, but the but the interesting thing that you know, I've been using
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.360]   This this phone to pay with for at least two years
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.720]   Um because that that's when they started doing that and the retail support in the us has been really poor
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.400]   Um, you know, I would spot a terminal and I'd pay with this and the the um shop
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.800]   Someone go what just happened did you hack my term? Yeah, they don't like them. It looked like I closed transaction out by attacking it with my with my phone
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.520]   Um because they they hadn't you know, they hadn't seen these things in action
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.160]   Even though it's been widespread in in Japan and europe for a while
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   um, I think one of the things that the two thing apple brings two things to this one is
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.360]   um
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.880]   The mind share and marketing muscle and the ability to persuade all the retailers to upgrade their terminals because
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.840]   All these high value shoppers will be will be demanding it
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.520]   Um, so it's actually great for the people who are booting retail terminals
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:56.400]   But the other key thing that they've brought is that the fingerprint ID because when you use the um android phone to pay you basically have to
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.160]   Tap your phone unlock your phone type in your google wallet pin
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.320]   So you're you're you're faffing about with a phone quite a lot before the
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.600]   Um transaction goes through whereas with the apple one because you can do that with one grab of the
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.560]   Um fingerprint id thing and tap and then tap
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:18.560]   Um, they can make that very smooth and that that is that is a big difference in in user experience at the at the checkout
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.640]   I think well in timing is it's funny. It's both good and bad of course the timing is bad because
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:30.320]   apple's eye cloud was hacked and uh to the great embarrassment of a lot of uh celebrities but uh good because of the
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.120]   uh recent hacks
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.120]   On target and a home depot
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.960]   Yeah, uh really making people very aware of the vulnerability of point of sale systems and apple's done right
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.400]   It's a single use
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.280]   It's a single use number uh both credit card and
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:53.360]   Confirming pin one time only can't be reused and this is even more important the retailer gets no personal information at all apple maintains that
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.680]   So, uh
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.960]   Well, yeah, I mean that's to apples benefit and of course you have to trust apple
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.000]   Uh not on two levels one not to invade your privacy and two not to accidentally be hacked
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.880]   But assuming you do all that that's a
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.240]   Far site better than giving a credit card to a waiter who wanders off in europe. They don't do that right
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.080]   Uh, kevin you they actually bring a terminal to the table and show you swine
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.640]   Wiping it and you have a card so it's not chips and they have pins. Yeah, this is better than that even though
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:27.200]   This is a step beyond that. Yes, the target wouldn't have any information about you at all that it could be uh could be hacked
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.800]   Right
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.120]   I mean the difference between this and the the iCloud hack is that um money is fungible
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.440]   so if they um
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.840]   Take your money by mistake. They can refund you whereas if they take you or your naked pictures, they can't
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.240]   Take your back. Nope
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.800]   There's so that so and that that means that a lot of this you know, oh, it's a security blah blah blah
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.440]   That it's not really a benefit for you because the credit card companies are already liable for doing things wrong
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.160]   And they will they can refund the money and that's why they ran the you know tv ads about
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.000]   identity theft sorry to take you seriously with a cat's tail to go
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.040]   Say hello
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.680]   No, I said and and and of course, you know google's you know
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.680]   Start trying to do it has been doing this but it doesn't have it's too fragment
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.360]   It doesn't have the cloud apple does apple has the the market cloud to make this happen
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.160]   So this is good for everybody because your android phone. Yes, we'll do it
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.400]   But this is not an open system, right? I mean this is the this you won't do apple pay
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.840]   But but this but it will do tap to pay and I think tap to pay is here
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.720]   Yeah, it's it's it's it's on tap to pay and it's not an apple all apple is doing
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.800]   um internally is
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.720]   Is is for some sake the merchant payment?
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.720]   You still have to use you have to sign up for as a payment as a merchant with a payment processor
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.360]   And they're just making the transaction happen, right?
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.840]   So they're they're not um, they're not becoming the middleman here. They're just becoming the the broker of the device effectively
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.400]   Yeah, now that may change. I mean I suspect this is one of the things where they've um
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.320]   Like when they launched iTunes originally they said, okay, we've got to digitize your industry
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.720]   But we don't actually want any of the revenue. We just want to sell the gadgets
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.880]   So they say it's the music business
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.280]   And they may change over time with the ability to spend money that you've got in your apple account by
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.200]   You know, I'm putting money in in that way that that's the bit that's um
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.000]   Not clear yet that that happens with the google account
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.880]   Um, you can you can put money into your google account and spend that rather than actually using a credit card
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:27.600]   Um, and it's not clear that that's possible with apple pay thing. Yeah, it seems like you're they're actually always broken in credit card at the moment
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.240]   Anyway, there's not I mean if you want to know more watch mac break weekly and every other show this week
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.720]   This is a google show
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.920]   Uh, but no, but I think look google's in these spaces
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.560]   Uh, and I think the other thing that uh, it's got struck me last night is
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.320]   um
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.280]   apple was
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:53.920]   Smart to delay because they're watch can now build upon what they've learned and what we've learned from previous watches is
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.240]   And the and and by delaying they also avoid things like wearable glasses
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.120]   And so, uh, google it takes some arrows in the back by being upfront on these
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.800]   Apple's content to sit back say good luck
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:13.360]   Have fun over there. You know, I'm surprised. So the glass just went for sale on play. Yeah, I'm actually surprised
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   I'm surprised it wasn't just killed
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.280]   There's no market for that. I can't I mean, but they probably have some in the warehouse. What are they going?
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:26.720]   Maybe it's an embarrassing admission. Hey, I want to take a break for stacks and then I know there are a lot of people from the indy web movement

[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.120]   Today imagine snacks delivered to your door. What a world we live in
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:08.720]   What's talk indie what what is the indie web kevin marks? You've been you come on here several times and talked about it
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.440]   But can you can you in a thumbnail describe it?
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.680]   I'll have a have a go at that
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.680]   that the basic idea is
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.920]   Going back to the the thinking that started the web of people having their own websites and connecting between those
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.360]   Um
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.560]   rather than
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.680]   Hosting everything on a site that belongs to a large company like facebook or twitter or even google plus
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.040]   um
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:37.360]   And this is in in in a sense. It's going back to the the blogging web that we remember from 10 years ago
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:45.120]   Um, but it's also not pretending these um sites don't exist but working out how to incorporate them into into this as well
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:51.440]   So making sure that you can post things on your own site, but share them out through these social networks. Um and
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.640]   Connect things back and forth between the two
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.840]   And it makes sense to me, you know, because well for a couple of things come strike me first of all
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.040]   Everyone here has pumped content into twitter
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.920]   to uh the benefit
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.800]   Of have williams and company
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.600]   Um, but that content is is theirs now in ours. In fact, I had I have this morning
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.560]   I made a request to download my tweets and i'm still waiting for the email from twitter they all knows
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:23.760]   Same thing with facebook. Well you and that they actually they say you own them, but they host them
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.360]   twitter has got a fairly good terms of service on that but the terms of service where it gets sticky is
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.440]   Um, they don't want you posting to twitter and to other things in parallel
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.280]   They've got some some weirdness like that
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.240]   So you have to make sure you post to your site and copy to twitter
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.280]   Um, because if you if you try and do some of the other things then then they will refuse your app
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.080]   um, a PR but I also feel like um
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:51.200]   Their silos ultimately their data silos there they're they're they're doing their connect very well
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.480]   You're you're giving people stuff. They're storing whatever their
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   Nice terms of service are they rate limit access
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:06.240]   You know, they don't new new developers can't write third-party apps google plus to this day doesn't have a right api
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.480]   They read only
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.760]   Uh facebook
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:14.640]   Well, I don't even know what facebook's policy. It's about your posts sure feels like they own them
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.200]   I and decide who sees them in a fairly draconian way
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.400]   so obviously there's a better way so um
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.240]   Ben word molar is here along with erin what i'm sorry miller
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.200]   Which richy richy i'm sorry
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.760]   Uh, and they're the founders of a company called. Well, it was idno initially, right? Is that idno?
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:44.720]   That so idno was the original name of the kind of open source software that became the core of no audience so idno was open and uh
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.880]   Was that your software banner? Yeah, it was um, that's right
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.160]   And so uh, I actually I started building it last year and I brought it into the indy web camp
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.520]   Which is a regular meeting, you know of the indy web community and uh erin and I started collaborating over that
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.000]   Yeah, and kevin told me about it this summer
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.240]   In fact, we corresponded at the time you needed to use mongo db
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:12.320]   And so I said good let me know when i can use it with my sql you can now
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.920]   Uh, yes, that was actually one of the things that we found out early on through some user interviews
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:24.800]   When we were reaching out to people who had showed early interest in using the platform and from talking to a lot of them
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.400]   We found out that a lot of people really wanted to use it but in order
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   To make sure we had a product that was
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.840]   Unisable by the greatest number of people it needed to be compatible with my sql
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.320]   Well and also which
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:45.680]   Ironically you've now in a little bit kind of contrary to the indy web tenant you have a hosted version at known at with known.com
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.320]   Yes, so we are
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:55.760]   Launching our we're launching the open beta for the hosted version. Yeah, um tomorrow and oh neat
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   Yeah, so we're very
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.680]   Well, let's go ahead jeff
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:08.320]   It's not really contrary unless you're being dogmatic. It's it's it's an optional somebody else is now hosting it
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.360]   Yeah, but but if you raise the choice you're making
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.040]   Yeah
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:13.920]   So
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.520]   Yeah, and it is all about choice, right?
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.440]   I mean if you want to run known on your own server you can absolutely grab our code and do that and it's it got all the same features
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.840]   You got lots of control if you don't have the technical ability or you don't want to worry about running your own server
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.280]   You can run it on ours and you can move the site. We're gonna let you move the site
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:37.920]   So you can you can start off on our hosted version move to your own self-hosted version or go in the other direction
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.280]   That solves it. I think you have to have that kind of starter that solves it. Yeah, it was the same same with with
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.840]   Workhouse and think up
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.000]   Yeah, well and and by the way, I mean I had an experience with the six apart
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.720]   I used to use type pad which was self-hosted
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:59.600]   And then they introduced a kind of an easy to use blogging platform called Vox and I loved Vox and I posted everything on Vox
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.120]   Then they went out of business
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.480]   I was able to get my content but not my pictures because they were all stored on Vox
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.640]   And so now my blog half of it
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.480]   From three years span has no images because the images are gone. Oh
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.720]   So
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   So I have some experience with
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:21.200]   Letting others host and I really decided I currently run a WordPress blog can't wait to replace it because it's it's
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.560]   The problem I have with WordPress is big. It's clunky. It does everything and I don't need to do everything
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.840]   What does what is so I'll show you my
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.680]   Personal known which is very straightforward very simple. Here's the experience that you'll get as a user
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   It reminds me a little tumbler. So you have status updates
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.800]   Blog style posts photos
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.440]   check-ins bookmarks
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.240]   And audio you also have which is kind of neat it will you can tie it to
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.360]   Let me see if I can find that
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.880]   Twitter
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.880]   Facebook
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.760]   It uses soundcloud
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.040]   And there are all these additional features for comics
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.320]   Let me enable comics events. You've added some firefox and indipub
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.960]   So is the idea you're going to have a whole variety of content forms
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.760]   and then I I've just posting pictures and
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:20.080]   and text and bookmarks. In fact, there's a little bookmarklet that you can
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.600]   Click that will create a bookmarklet status update
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:31.280]   Yeah, yeah, I mean the idea is that you know, we shouldn't be limited to the kinds of content that you have on
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.360]   Facebook and Twitter and so on and you know those have sort of congealed around the same
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.200]   Sort of, you know, you've got status updates. You've got longer posts. You've got photos
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.760]   you've got videos and you've got events and
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.840]   You know, although those are the common content types part of control is, you know, controlling the form of what you post as well
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.720]   So we want to play with that over time and let people play with that too
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:56.000]   And so if you're from if you're on the her self-hosted, you're going to be able to get, you know, community content types
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.960]   For the hosted, you know, we'll take some of those as well and incorporate them in over time
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.440]   And the same goes for, you know, networks what you syndicate to so, you know, in the general case
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.240]   Yeah, you're you're posting to your own site and you're syndicating to Twitter and Facebook in education
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.640]   You're posting to your own site and you're syndicating to Moodle, you know, different different different different
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.080]   Areas, you know, have different needs and it'll be able to deal with all of that
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.440]   And because it's an open source layway extensible platform
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.240]   It's been very easy for people to pick it up and start writing plugins for things that they want
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.960]   So it's easy to get started and get up and run if there's if there's something that you want that isn't there
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.200]   What form are these plugins written in?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.360]   So there the plugins are PHP and so, you know, we we did that
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.440]   Um, you know because it is incredibly widely installable
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.560]   Uh, and so, you know, they're really simple. We had a guy
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.920]   Who picked up known and 24 hours later he'd written a WordPress plugin, which is, you know, totally awesome
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.760]   And then on top of that, um because the indie web, you know, the the technologies that the indie web community has created
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:07.520]   Are so lightweight really easy to use, you know, it's it's actually pretty simple to put all this stuff together
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.640]   So when you first look at it, uh, and i've showed it to some people
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.680]   I said, well that looks just like tumblr or how is that different from another blogging platform?
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:22.080]   It's a lot like owning your own tumblr in terms of the in terms of the interface and I think that's uh, that's actually great
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.640]   Tumbler did um did a really good job
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.080]   Operability with all the other services that you can use it as your
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.920]   Exactly
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.120]   Publish once right once published multiple times
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.560]   It's funny because I I installed eight different kinds of tumbler software before tumblr came along
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.440]   Because the the idea of a tumbler log is predates tumblr
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:48.400]   Yeah, and um most of them were open source. There's you know similar ideas and I ended up using tumblr because it was just so damn easy
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.840]   Yeah
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.760]   Yeah, that's what I was doing. Um, I've always played around with a lot of different open source
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.560]   Uh, cms's blog platforms tumbled platforms all sorts of things in my own space
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.920]   And that's one of the things that interested me in the indy web community
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   Because I had spent so much time fiddling around with these other open source platforms
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.360]   The other people built but I didn't necessarily have the technical skills to build a platform on my own
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:17.280]   Um, and when I met ben he was working on the inno project and we saw a lot of potential
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.440]   And using that platform. So we like it's been really exciting
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.200]   So I mean if you can take the you know like tumblr's interfaces like the interfaces that are
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.040]   You see on the best of breed of the of the consumer web
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:38.080]   But actually, you know use that as a really easy to use way to get at all this extra syndication power all of the indy web power
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.240]   Uh, you know, we see that as a pretty good way to go
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.760]   The idea is to make it that simple the reason that you picked tumblr the reason that you picked
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:49.600]   You know you used twitter and so on but actually give you control allow you to tweak it allow you to
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.120]   To evolve your site over time. We think that's pretty powerful
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.680]   What's your gotta ask you since we have the conversation in san francisco. What's the business model?
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.720]   So there's there's a couple of different things
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:06.080]   I mean first of all if you've got the technical ability you can just pick it up run the call software on your service
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.680]   But we actually think that most people aren't going to use the uh hosted solution
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   Most people aren't going to want to uh, worry about running their own server
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:20.720]   So, you know pat you can start using that for free, but you can actually uh, we're going to be selling higher capacity subscriptions
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.720]   Uh, we're also going to be selling, um, support subscriptions for everybody
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:31.440]   We're going to be selling customizations and for people like universities that want to run at campus wide and for people who want to run it in the enterprise
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:38.160]   Uh, we're actually absolutely going to be selling those, um, licenses as well. Yeah, so we started with higher education
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.880]   As our, as our first market and we just had a couple of pilot classes
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:48.000]   Um, with the beginning of the fall semester who started up all their students are creating websites unknown
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.760]   And we've got a lot of people interested in and working with us for the fall to get their students using the software
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:59.760]   Cool. So did you like i got asked this is very inside baseball. Would you have to ask did you drop this idea of going after journalists first
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:06.000]   We i saw i saw tell you what happened actually as we decided the because education was so
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.680]   Uh incredibly enthusiastic and we've been working with this guy, uh, jim grew at the university of mary, washington
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.560]   Who's just absolutely a he's like an edtech superhero
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.040]   the, um, you know, we started decided that that was going to be our first
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:26.080]   Uh market, but what's happened is they actually really quickly journalists have been coming to us and and seeing this and seeing the published
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:32.560]   Uh, you know what tantec chalec calls publish on your own site centricate elsewhere. Um, you know, they've seen that model
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.200]   And, um, you know, they want us to integrate it with their ecosystems
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:43.360]   What we're also finding is that a lot of the things we've talked about with journalists and people in the wetter media industry
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:49.360]   Are actually also things that are applicable, um to a lot of students and a lot of people in the education space
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:57.280]   So working with these education pilots will give us the opportunity to roll out some of these features in conjunction with classes of students and
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:02.400]   Um, eventually they'll also be well-refined and applicable for people in journalism and media as well
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.120]   So i'm just going to show you the uh, so people understand a little bit better about
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.000]   Uh, what some of the features are i'm now going to put a status update out
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:19.200]   Um, uh, that ben and and erin are on the show and i'm going to click twitter and facebook too right now of the social networks
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:26.080]   I've uh, federated although I presume there will be more down the road there is flicker that will and many other now when I publish
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.960]   It's going to publish this status update not only to
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.760]   My known blog but also to twitter and facebook and I think it does a nice job
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.160]   Um, by the way of handling the hashtags
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.560]   Uh, making it native
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.600]   On uh native looking on those platforms if you watch if you look at my twitter feed you'll see it's there
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.760]   If you look at my facebook feed you'll see it's there
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:53.920]   Although I often hear people say, you know, it's not right to do that you should uh, you should be posting natively on the platform that you're posting to
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.560]   You should post natively on twitter you put natively on facebook post the kind of posts that are right for those
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.120]   Sites and by the way, we have to say there is no google plus because and there's there's the twitter feed
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.680]   And I think that looks good that looks like a native post
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.960]   So I mean the the thing about the argument about posting uh differently to different networks is
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.640]   I mean, that's right. I mean you probably a lot of people have different
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.040]   Communities on those different networks, but that's totally cool. I mean you can write a post
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.240]   Uh, and this is to have any india platform. You can write a post
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:30.160]   Uh, and just syndicate it to one of those networks and write another post and just syndicate it to another one of those networks
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.320]   So I I find myself posting a lot of photos that don't go to twitter for example
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.960]   Because not everybody wants to see yet another cup of coffee on twitter or anywhere fair enough
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.840]   Uh, I do inflict that on my people on facebook for example
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:48.640]   Somebody's tantec is in the chat room. Hi tantec. He says, uh, he's I'm demonstrating posse
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:53.200]   Yes, what is that publish on your own site syndicate elsewhere?
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.360]   Love it
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:01.360]   Um the other thing is it depends on the post type if you've got a status update update like post then that makes sense to replicate
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.400]   Twitter as is right if you've got a longer blog post you do want to send a summary and
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:12.240]   Which will be probably the title of the post and a link to it to twitter and also on facebook when you do that
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.040]   you want to send it in such a way that it shows up as
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:22.160]   I come where they call it, but they have a special post type for that that shows it like um like a news article or something like that
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.800]   So they have they they have sort of moved from saying you should post everything in our form
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.560]   They're saying actually we want facebook to um reflect
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.640]   Um news stories and things like that. They've got a big chunk of guidance on their side about that. So part of the part of the value of
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:43.440]   This is coming up with ways to to replicate stuff into these sites in a way that it does look native and and makes sense
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.600]   In that form but also points back to the stand on version
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.880]   So if you look at the facebook replicate replication of this
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:57.280]   Um, the link says see original to point back to to the known version to make it clear that that is that is the the source of it
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.560]   I think that does that here very nicely on facebook for instance where
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:06.080]   Uh, it this is what the facebook post looks like and it's got a nice little, you know, it tells you what twit live is
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.960]   But it sources it as from known right there
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.640]   Uh, in fact if I click known I presume it's going to take me back to my
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.040]   Original posts
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   Maybe not. No, it's going to take me to known
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.640]   No, if you go back at the bottom it says see original and that's the link
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.280]   Ah, okay. I clicked the wrong link. All right. Let's as usual. I've used facebook incorrectly
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.840]   Uh, see original right there it is actually that link will eventually post to you
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   Okay, post to your site now if you self-host what's gonna happen is it'll say this was posted via, you know, leo loport
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.040]   Self-hosted known whatever you decide to call that and i'll name that you
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.760]   Come in as stream so i've named, um mind stream and so things that show up on facebook
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.320]   Come in as stream for me. I really like this idea. I
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.080]   I'm a
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.120]   After my experience with vox i'm a big believer in the idea that
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.000]   All of your content should live on a site you control. I mean, I guess a hosted site
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.840]   Is fine as long as you guys guarantee a you're not going to sell out to facebook and be you're going to let me get my data out of it
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.200]   Yeah
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.560]   If you do
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.000]   And uh or better yet if you're if you've savvy enough and you've got a server of your own just hosted on your own servers
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Is I think the ideal way but it also feels that's a little retro, isn't it? I mean the web has moved far away from that concept
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.520]   Has it how do you mean well
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.120]   It's not how people do it anymore do people even create their own blog websites anymore
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.880]   Sure, they do
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:34.480]   No, your guys do people you know your guys do but real people have a facebook page. I'm on the web
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.720]   I got a web page is called facebook
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.120]   I know people and i'm not sucking up to another sponsor here, which is square space
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:46.480]   Square space. Yeah, well square space is better square space. That is your own site
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.600]   Right your own site, but it's also easy and hosted right and it's much like with known
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.560]   That's a site and you can get your data out of it. You're not stuck in it
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.800]   But that's not what most people do most people say I have a twitter page
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.560]   I have a facebook most of course
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.360]   20% of the web as well. You have to remember that
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.000]   Be chunky the web is hosted on WordPress
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.200]   Um
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.960]   So people are familiar with this idea. Why is this better than wordpress.com
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   Um because it's um, it's built on these indie web protocols
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.200]   So it's designed to interoperate from the start
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.240]   Um, you can make that work on WordPress, but you have to install a lot of plugins
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.880]   So so part of the point of this is that you
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.280]   This is not meant to be a monolithic system that is just one code base
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.720]   It's meant to be using a set of protocols that will interoperate whatever site you're running
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.840]   So i've got a statically hosted site at kevinmarks.com as well as the known one there
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.240]   Um, I can interoperate back and forth with this by using these
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.120]   web mentioned protocols by using
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.680]   the
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:53.680]   The sort of marking up with micro formats to to point out that this is a reference to another site and so on
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.960]   Um
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.360]   And if you look, you know, if you look at the post you just made erin parecki posted a comment on that on his side
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.880]   He's not using known. He's using his own software. Wait a minute. That's interesting. I didn't know that
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.120]   So so that so comments are federated too. Yes
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.040]   So if you look at the
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.400]   The comments basically we post a comment on our own site, but that is federated back to you because we use
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.640]   um, what's called web mention to say
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:23.280]   Ping your stuff ping your site and say we've mentioned you here's his the link and you and your site fetches that link and as it to the bottom
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.960]   It's like track back
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   It's like track back but not ugly
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   It works. So okay. I'm looking here. So so this is really cool
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:37.040]   So this is on my on my known page now and this comment here from ben roberts that was done from his
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.720]   site
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.720]   Yes, that's right
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.680]   If I click his name will it pull me to that site it will the the
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.480]   The comment lives on his own site
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.560]   Uh, but it also now lives on your site
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.640]   So if your site for example goes away for any reason if you decided you don't want one anymore
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.360]   He still has that conversation he had with you now
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.480]   This is a little weird because it shows up as a post on his site
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.560]   um
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   Which is a little out of context
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.360]   But that's probably how he set it up, right?
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.600]   Right. That's the beauty of the end you web everyone gets to do whatever they want for themselves
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.120]   I mean what we're trying to do is make that as easy as as easy as possible for people to do
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.000]   So, you know if you are a developer you can use the micro formats
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.800]   You can use the you know, you can build your own web mentioned clients and so on
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.080]   What we do is is you know try and try and make that
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:31.680]   A simplest possible. I think it's not quite right but as well that it's sort of a prettier track back
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.320]   Uh, I think there's a lot more that's possible with it
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.320]   You can RSVP to events
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.720]   You can uh, you know the social actions that you're used to on site select twitter and facebook
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:48.000]   Are are possible with this technology and so it is actually and you know, there are a lot of reasons why
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:57.120]   Uh, there are better, you know ways to frame this but it is the framework for a more decentralized, uh, social web. Yeah, erin erin has a similar
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:02.240]   Uh track back, but there's more context on his page. So that's up. It's up to them
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.440]   These are all indie web people who are watching today. Thank you for joining
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.360]   Now, uh somebody's already asked well, how do I install this
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.640]   Do they go to the idno github? Where do they get known?
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:18.720]   So tomorrow, uh on our website with known calm you can be able to just download the installer
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.520]   Uh, so that's something that uh that is going to be available
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.040]   Uh, we're actually part of an accelerator called, uh, matter
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.680]   Uh, demo day is tomorrow morning and in conjunction with that
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.880]   We're gonna be we're gonna be releasing both, uh, the hosted beta and the installable date
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.080]   beta, um, then and in fact you sent me that tarball last night and uh,
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:50.480]   Uh, I have some configuration stuff to do to my site mostly because I I long ago gay feel for all control of it to it administrator, but
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:55.440]   Once I get once I get bear to give me permission to modify my site again
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.600]   I'll have that running and i'll probably just now what about the content i've posted on with known can I easily move that to my
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.320]   Yeah, so what we're gonna do is uh, you know, as time goes on, you know
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.520]   The ambition is basically to give you a button, uh to allow you to do that
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.040]   Uh
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:17.440]   Because we're in beta. It's a little bit more complicated than that, but it's something that you know will help anybody who wants to do it
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:21.040]   Uh to do, um, so you're not you're not locked up in our service
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.200]   And, um, yeah, it's gonna be it's gonna be a really simple thing to do
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.760]   It requires a lamp stack right?
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.640]   Let me make sopachi my s ql and php
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.200]   php 5.4 and 5.4. Okay. Yeah, i'm pretty typical pretty common
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:41.600]   That's exactly the point. Yeah, so it's um, you should be able to install it on anything with supports php in my school
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:49.280]   And right now your social media connectors and i'll show it right here include twitter facebook flicker four square and soundcloud that's a nice set
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:55.200]   Presumably ones you've coded yourself people will be able to add more and i'll will i will this list lengthen as time
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.800]   It will lengthen a lot of people have asked us for linked in for example, uh, google plus, you know, you can't do it
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.400]   There's no right api what about companies like google let's say, uh, uh, uh
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:10.480]   But what about the google plus pages which have a bit more of an api so that's that's something that we're going to be thinking about as well
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.880]   Uh, and you know if anybody
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:18.320]   From a network that is interested in you know allowing people from known to to post to it
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.440]   You know, we're gonna be working we're gonna be working with lots of lots of platforms
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:29.360]   And for universities that list would it would include the university's learning management system or any platform that the school wants to include there
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.480]   Blackboard or news organization. Yes, it's the CMS. Yeah
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:39.200]   Um, i'm running nginx on top of apache and it's working fine. Does it does it but it does require apache?
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:44.080]   So you can we have had users who have actually installed it on straight nginx. There's a little bit
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.040]   You've got to manually configure it, but we've got some information up on our documentation page as well
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:54.480]   And we'll be expanding them. This is very early days you ever it's free right now you intend to stay free
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.640]   So yeah, uh
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.720]   You're always gonna be able to take known and install it for free, but like i say, we're gonna be selling support
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.520]   We're gonna be selling, uh, you know higher capacity
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.160]   Hosted versions and we could we're gonna be selling, uh, you know fully supported
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:15.360]   Site licenses as well. Mm-hmm. I'm replacing my blog platform with this as soon as I can because I just I feel like it's simple
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:21.840]   It's clean. It's elegant and it encourages kind of this I love federation. I don't know why but just this idea that
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.080]   Well, I have a central spot that's me
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:30.800]   But uh, but I don't that doesn't mean it's a silo. It's it integrates with everybody else. I really like that idea. Great job guys
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.480]   Yeah, Kevin. Are there other other members of the indy web ecosystem that you want to list
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.840]   Other people doing things with the same they're all in the chat room right now
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:44.320]   Um, I put in a link to the um so the best way to get in touch with the indy web
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.640]   Um is indy web camp.com
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.880]   Um, that's that page lists
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:54.320]   Um, the events that we that we organize for this and that has a prominent link to the ios e channel
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.040]   Which has people in it 24 hours a day talking about this stuff
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:03.200]   Um, but it's also a wiki that has documentation about these different protocols and and what and what we thought about that
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.560]   What we're thinking about them and the assumption is we
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:13.040]   Have to face meetings. We have discussions in ios e and then we write that up on the wiki to document it iteratively
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:17.680]   And in fact, there's a meetup tonight in san francisco at mazilla at
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.120]   6 30 and there's also meetups in portland in chicago. I think i'll actually look at the
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.240]   The page to see exactly where they are but um
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.480]   And I believe the next big indy web camp is coming up in october in kambridge
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.160]   kambridge kambridge yes
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:39.520]   Yes, um, like just last weekend there was indy web camp in brichton, uk
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.160]   um and quite a lot of
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.480]   New bits and pieces got put together there there's some
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:50.720]   People have been building a commenting system that would let you post the comment on your own site
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.520]   Without leaving the site you're commenting on
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.880]   Um
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.760]   That so that so it's involved some some voodoo involving i frames and registering protocol handlers
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:05.440]   But it means that you could click the comment button on your side and I would post write the comment there and get posted to my side
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.720]   That's just great
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.640]   So the nice thing is is that because we've been building in this in this way
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.200]   We've been trying very hard to make it so that it isn't
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.400]   Um just one code base just on my big platform
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:24.320]   But lots of people building the pieces independent themselves and that acts as a natural check on this stuff getting too complicated
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.000]   Because if more than one person has to implement it and they're doing on their own sites
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.080]   Um that stops us from going oh well, we could just add this and this and this and this and this and going well
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.480]   What's the smallest thing that we could do to make this work?
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.680]   Um, and if you look at these protocols, they are very um sort of neat in that way
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:46.720]   Yeah, and you know, there's a lot to be said for building lots of tiny uh prototypes that sort of you know, it's what we do
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.600]   Uh all of the startups are mad to do it's um, it's you know, it's what we trying to make
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.520]   Part of our process and it's definitely something the indie web community does very well as well
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:01.360]   Um, it's a it's the way thing to do. I wanted to add actually, you know, I said that tomorrow we're going to be announcing the
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.080]   Uh beta service and the and the download, you know, if anybody does want to try
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.040]   Uh, what we've done which, you know to emphasize is one
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.640]   Uh, indie web indie web platform, but uh if you go to with known.com/beta
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.840]   Uh, you know, feel free to feel free to sign up for a free account
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.800]   Great
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.240]   With known.com/beta if you want to know more about the indie web
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.800]   indiewebcamp.com
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:30.320]   A people focused alternative to the corporate web your content is yours. You're better connected. You are in control
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.480]   Uh, this is this is really the how how it should be how it was supposed to be
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.720]   Doesn't replace the corporate web. It's just uh, we get to have our own little corner
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.200]   Yeah, I like it
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.040]   Aaron and ben, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it. Thank you for having us
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.400]   Wonderful. Good luck and thank you for helping me get mine set up
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   I'm excited
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.760]   You've added you know since last night you've added features so I just went back there and I go oh there's there's theming
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.920]   Oh, there, you know, so
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.920]   It's getting prettier as I as we speak
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:06.160]   I feel free to get in touch. I mean we've got a little huh in the top right of uh both the hosted and the self-hosted
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.080]   And that's like literally it's basically a way to email us and we've been you know
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:17.840]   Talking to lots of people uh of the days in particular and yeah, I mean we were really really happy to help. Yeah, neat
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.880]   Uh, my site is uh
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.160]   Going to be there for a little while longer but then I'm gonna move it local
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:30.480]   leoville.withknown.com and then sign up for the beta with known.com/beta so you can do it yourself
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:35.360]   And you again, it's hosted you don't have to uh be mucking around with your database unless you want to
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.080]   I like to do that kind of thing
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:42.240]   Bear said I could he says you won't break anything because you're not attached to anything because we made sure that you were completely
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.880]   isolated from the rest of the servers
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.920]   So have at it
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:53.040]   Thank you guys. Take care. Thank you. Yes. We got more to come in fact a very big change log. What are we gonna do?
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:57.760]   Uh, uh, jeff i gene is not here to do the change log. We blew it last time fell off
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.360]   I don't think we should do the change like but boy there's some big changes with google voice and more
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.880]   We'll talk about that as we continue, but first let me talk about my mattress
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.240]   You know this show rapidly is becoming about my needs my snacks
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.520]   my mattress
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:18.080]   I got one for henry too. This is actually a great mattress for a kid going off to college henry
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.800]   You know, uh is out of the dorms now he's in a
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:27.600]   Place with a bunch of other guys and he has to get furniture and I thought oh I don't want to do the whole mattress thing
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.880]   Casper we sent him a Casper mattress. It comes in a big box. Look take a look
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.520]   I have my Casper mattress. These are the most comfortable mattresses ever
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:43.120]   This is a queen side. Excuse me queen size mattress that comes in a box. Look at the size of this box
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.760]   And you open it up now. They say open it up
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:50.960]   Near your bed. I didn't I opened it up in the hall front hall, which probably wasn't a good idea
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:56.800]   Their foam mattresses with memory phone on the top and they are super comfortable
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.760]   It's gonna take a little getting used to if you're used to those mattresses with springs in it. There's no lumps
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.360]   It just feels good. See like that. It's it's opening up. Oh
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.800]   It's firm, but soft. I don't know how to describe it
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.920]   When you have that fella top
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:17.200]   It gives you it it it it could forms to your body and yet there is the firm support that I need for my back
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.320]   I just love my Casper mattress
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.160]   Casper is kind of a neat startup
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:30.960]   They're slashing the cost of the typical $1,500 mattress. They cut out the resellers in the showroom
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:36.640]   You buy it directly now that I know that makes people nervous ago. Oh wait wait, but you get 100 days
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.040]   to try it
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.760]   Even aussie loves our Casper mattress. That's lit and streaky on my face by the way
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:47.120]   Even lisa loves our Casper mattress
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.280]   It is so comfortable
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.640]   And because they don't have a showroom they pass the savings on to you
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:58.320]   You buy it online completely risk-free 100 days to decide whether you want to keep it 100 days
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.520]   And if you don't want it, don't worry. You don't have to put it back in the box. I'll send somebody your house together
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:08.560]   I always want to well, how do I get it back in that box once you take it out of the box? That's really a one-way trip
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.280]   Statistically lying on a bed in a showroom has no correlation
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.480]   I can tell you right now to what the experience is of sleeping
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:22.080]   on a mattress Casper mattress is made in the USA only $500 for a twin
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.040]   950 for a king king
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.280]   And uh, you're gonna say $50 if you go to Casper C-A-S-P-E-R sleep.com
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:38.160]   Slash twig and using the promo code twig they'll save you $50 and not only that but for every $50
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:42.800]   For every mattress that you buy they will donate $50 to child's play, which is a great group that helps
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.440]   needy and sick kids
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.440]   Casper
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.440]   sleep.com
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:54.080]   Slash twig you'll know when you see that what I can't read it. It's too small
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.480]   What should I just speak to me talk to me jet talk to me?
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:06.560]   Casper sleep.com slash twig using the other code twig you'll say 50 bucks off and they will send $50 to child's play
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.760]   um, I just I
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:16.560]   In fact, I'm gonna have some nature box on my Casper mattress and then my whole world will be complete
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:21.520]   So they said they say you won you should get one Jeff
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.880]   You'd love to get one. They just stay with the offer to send me one. You know who would like it Jake would like it
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.560]   Mm-hmm
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:33.120]   Henry I asked Henry because he was home over the weekend. I said did the mattress come he said yeah
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:37.680]   I said you I wanted you to do a vine of you opening the mattress. He said well, we didn't do that
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.000]   But I said do you like he says I love it
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:47.200]   And henry's finicky. He would not I get so I got him a mattress in my house when he was staying with me
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.360]   And he says I don't like it. He wouldn't sleep at my house and he said he mattresses. It's too hard
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.520]   He loves the Casper. So I get that's why I got a Casper for our guest room
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:59.040]   I got a Casper for henry. We got Casper's every one should take one with me to hotels. I would
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.120]   In Berlin
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:05.360]   It was it was uh plaidwood the hotel mattresses the worst ever
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.840]   They really are
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:13.440]   Oh, yeah, I'll shave with Harry shave cream in my Casper mattress eating snacks
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.640]   I use Harry's too
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.240]   We're rapidly becoming a lifestyle network
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.840]   That was always kind of my goal by the way
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:28.320]   I didn't want to do technology ads because then with technology ads there's a little bit of the the idea is
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.920]   You know, there may be is a conflict of interest because then you can't report on the company
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.640]   but if it's Casper mattresses and Harry's
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.200]   Shaving and nature
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:41.600]   Is lifestyle way back when when I worked with conda d asked when I was at the same company
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:46.560]   Yeah, um my proposal for what you do about wired magazine at the time was to make it a lifestyle magazine
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.560]   That's what conda does there's there's a thing about
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.480]   This is what's happening with technology. It's no longer a niche
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   Or as you would say kevin you can't abrogance
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.800]   niche
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.680]   It is I get criticism all the time for saying niche
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:07.840]   That's the american way to say it. We're in america. Okay, you're probably that probably that did
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.640]   uh in the niche that we're uh in
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.640]   Uh, it isn't a niche because it's technology now everywhere
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.120]   Everybody uses it. It's a part of our lives
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.760]   So how can you say this is especially it's not
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:28.480]   All right moving on I do love this uh with no are you you are using this at all uh kevin or do you have something else you
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.960]   Want to do with the I really like this known
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:36.480]   We've lost kevin. He doesn't he's just looking. Oh, oh, oh, sorry
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:41.840]   Well, he went to sleep on the mattress commercial. I know what happened
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.520]   I was chatting to the chat room. Sorry. I love this known stuff. I really do
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.200]   No, I think I think it's very it's very good. I mean, I've I've been I've been doing indie web snap on kevin marks.com
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.720]   But that was a statically hosted site, which means that I've got to do a lot of it by hand
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.520]   Yeah, so not all the pieces get get built
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.280]   This is quickly because it's got I have to do it myself and the nice thing about known is it means
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:05.680]   A lot of these protocols are built for me by by Ben and by other people working the other source project
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:12.400]   Yeah, um, and it just makes this stuff this stuff work. I can't do it. So is it using rest and it's you know
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   kind of ap well known apis or
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:19.360]   Yeah, um, it's it's basically it's it's pretty they're pretty much all rest apis
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.680]   Um, there are some there's some subtleties that we could we could probably go into another time if you if you
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.400]   want to bring people on about off
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:33.760]   Um, because there's this thing called indy orth that lets you authorize your own domain by using the logins from twitter and facebook and so on
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.200]   Right. Um
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:38.160]   Which means that you can you can prove that it's your domain
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.280]   Um, and that you can prove that you're connected through a trailer service
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:46.560]   Um, so that that means that if you use that you can use that to authenticate posting
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.840]   Um, to your own site from somebody else's site for example
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:53.840]   So there's there's a bunch of subtle stuff like that going on but each of these pieces have been built
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.120]   um
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.520]   As a standalone component and then wired together to build other things so we have the idea of
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.520]   um
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.560]   Web mentions which we discussed which is if I link to you
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:08.160]   Um, and then I look on your site for your web mentioned
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:13.040]   Um, URL, um, and then I send a post to that saying I just linked to you
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.600]   Here's that you're out of my post
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.240]   Um, and then you can go back to look at that post
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:22.560]   And see that's the thing that puzzles me that seems complicated this kind of federation
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:28.080]   That's does that micro pub and indy off is that so so there's there's there's there's three or four different bits of this
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:34.880]   This yeah, so indy orth is when you want to author it authenticate that you own a site and and so that service can post to it
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:39.280]   Micro pub is an end point that lets you post to your own site
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.320]   Um and uses indy orth to prove that it's you
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.880]   um, and then um
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:50.960]   Web mention is this I've written a comment on your site and here's linked to it. Um, and each of these
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.760]   Um, you know, they're all fairly straightforward services
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.080]   But you can couple them together to do interesting things
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:01.520]   And the nice thing is because we've had we've got multiple implementations of these where different people we've been
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.880]   um
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.440]   We've been several which are open source some of which aren't
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:12.720]   Um, some of which are services that other people run there's there's a web mention service that I use on my static site that will detect web mentions and post them
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.480]   Inline there
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.600]   So if you go to um kevin marks dot com and scroll down to the bottom
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.680]   You'll see there's web mentions there even though it's a static site because I've got some javascript that's calling a
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:23.120]   Um
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:26.640]   A service that someone else has written to absorb the web mentions and present them for me
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.880]   So there's there's the ability to do
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.720]   Yes, you see I've done the bottom there
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:36.880]   Those those web mentions and comments have been pulled in from um other people's sites because they've
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:42.800]   Um, because I've got a link in the head that points to a web mentions service that that runs on app engine
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:49.680]   Um, so there's a there's the ability to build with these components independently and plug them together into different sites
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.960]   Um
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:56.480]   And known is known as the sort of wraps up a this set of protocols that we've developed collectively over
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.440]   Three years or so in indie web and gives you a service that does that directly
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.400]   Um, you know, there are wordpress plugins that we do on WordPress as well
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.720]   Is there's a set of you know, well-known ways to do this so other people can add these things
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.840]   But the point is to make sure that they're um
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:19.600]   They're not monoliths. They're well-defined um point integrations that you can do incrementally and each one you do add some value to your site
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.000]   I feel like this
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.440]   Is really great and cool and I also wonder will anybody get it
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.600]   Um, I think
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.880]   It was one of the interesting things with this was um getting my son set up on this because they're they're both off at university
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.320]   And they wanted places to post stuff and they have you they're in some ways
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.240]   They're the target that ben and erin were talking about for university students
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.440]   um
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.480]   And
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.680]   You know as with any user testing what asked the questions they asked were very interesting because their reaction was
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.080]   Oh this composed to facebook. I'm wary about things that post to facebook because i've been bitten by those before
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.600]   Talked me through what this actually does. Oh, okay. It posts exactly what I say and that's what I want
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.400]   I can see where I might use that right and then my by other sound was like oh it posted sound
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.560]   Oh, that's really useful because I make mixes
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:15.200]   Um, and I want to post those to soundcloud right the problem is sometimes soundcloud will take them down because of what he's mixed together
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.840]   And so having a copy on his own site will be really nice for him
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.520]   so there's
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.360]   You know, there's a set of issues like that that
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.680]   um
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.840]   The thing you say about losing the stuff you've had on on on some content silo
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.440]   That's the experience more and more people have there's there's you know, there's a running joke about it
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:37.760]   Um about a wonderful thing just happened. We got bored and all your content's going away. Yeah, um, it's happened again and again
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.560]   And you know, you're who is a serial offender here
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.240]   um
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:48.320]   Google does this to facebook does it to lots of the companies by these by these little startups shut them down and take their engineers and get them to work on
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.480]   Their stuff instead
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.000]   So really good experience. I loved vox. It was kind of like this
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.400]   But because it wasn't open uh when ben and mina decided to shut it down
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.520]   Boom. I'm gone. My blog is gone
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.800]   And all your URLs now get us some new sites. Yeah
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.920]   Because they sell the domain as well. Yeah
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.000]   Yes, that's right. They did that come to think of it. I mean we made more money from that
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.360]   Well, this is this there's there's there's a phone there is um, do you remember upcoming?
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.600]   Okay, yeah, so so upcoming had went through this process by yahoo was bought by yahoo
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.520]   um, yahoo decided to shut it down but they um
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.200]   Andy bao who founded upcoming bought the domain back from yahoo and is reviving it. I love that
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.680]   So does he have the old data?
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.480]   He has the old data which is getting for the internet archive
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.000]   um
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.920]   And he's setting up new date. He's he's a bit busy because it's a exo conference this weekend, right?
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.160]   Which it also doesn't matter because it's an invite
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.480]   It's an invite you've been safe upcoming yet. Yeah, so old invitations who cares, but uh still that's great
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:59.200]   Well old events old events are interesting. Yeah, historically, you know, we organize a lot of events through upcoming and
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.120]   It is nice to see those old events. I guess so, yeah, um, and what you know what I hope to do is
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.800]   I showed you certainly some of the indy web events that we've posted on
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:15.440]   Um our sites here and and the have the distributed RSVPs. So I send you put I post an event on my site
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.120]   Um, you post an RSVP on your site and that shows up on my side
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:27.200]   Um, so that stuff will be great to integrate into into upcoming. Yes, um, we've already got gateways that bridge it over to facebook
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.440]   But it would be really nice to have something that does it natively so that i'm hoping to um
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.920]   Chat to hand you about that, but I suspect it's a bit busy over this over this weekend
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.800]   But that's your soundcloud example was a really good one. I I would love to post audio on soundcloud
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.760]   This is a better way to do it if I do it in with known
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.800]   Uh, it posts to my blog. I can I continue to own that wave file
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:55.040]   But it's then cross posted to soundcloud where the audience is mp3. I hope yes or whatever. Yeah, yeah
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:02.000]   Oh god, I was afraid of my sound was up. Jeff. I think those are still geeky concerns. I think I think the two consumer
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.960]   abilities for this are one
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.200]   The convenience that I can I can choose. Let's imagine this is a mobile app
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.800]   Post whatever I want wherever I want it from one place. Yeah, there's no mobile interface to this yet, right?
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.960]   There is a mobile web
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.080]   Sorry, there's a mobile web interface. There isn't a mobile app. All right
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.680]   So I can use a browser because this because it's been written by people who understand the web
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.160]   Um, you can just use a browser on android and that works pretty well
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.960]   It's it works well for posting photos and posting text
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.960]   Um, the web UI for posting um mp3 files is a bit tricky because you have to have already recorded it
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.520]   And there isn't a direct record button, right? But you can you can post that the second appeal
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.800]   I think is is is not so much that you're gonna save it against a site going down because people are pickle
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.040]   I don't think that's the big deal, but I think instead that you have your kind of portfolio place
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.080]   This is my stuff
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.440]   This is all my stuff in one place as a presentation of me
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.480]   And that's gonna require some subtle as you just pointed out about having a comment there that's in the context
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.520]   They're gonna learn a lot of how to do that, but I think those two things together are consumer propositions
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.920]   But but the business irony here is that only works in a sense if it remains independent if facebook buys their butt
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.160]   Then you lose a lot of the benefits of it being in a in d anymore
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:22.800]   Um, but if you can get some investment to make this big on consumer proposition and make it the interface to all the social networks
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:28.240]   And and the place to present my entire personality to the web. I think that has consumer
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.640]   Well, or even even more than that if
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:35.360]   Companies like squarespace and wordpress see this see the value in it
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.680]   And decide to participate
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:43.280]   Then squarespace could do that you stay on your squarespace site, but you were able to now be part of the federated
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.200]   internet
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:52.720]   That's even a better scenario. So yeah, so you're right. Uh, I just launched this on uh on chrome on my and right phone
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.520]   And I logged in so I get it's first of all there's a very it's totally mobile responsive
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.040]   But I can now post effective. I I think I could take a photo. We'll see
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.680]   uh on my phone. Yeah
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.560]   And uh and post directly from my phone
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.680]   Uh to the india web while that is cool
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.600]   Um, I like that
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:21.280]   To this so this post this is going to post to not only to with known but also I could post to twitter facebook and flicker same photo
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.760]   Love that
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:29.360]   So you're right. Uh, in fact, this is also better kevin, isn't it because it's the web the web is the web. It's not an app
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.320]   Exactly. Yeah, and the the challenge is making sure that it's um
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:40.960]   You know that this stuff doesn't create well on the web and part of that is that not all of the web stuff is ready yet
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:46.320]   Like the the web UI for recording sound is kind of broken right on the on the mobile thing
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.800]   So part of what we're gonna have to do is go and lobby the browser
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:54.160]   Um developers on iOS and android to say hey, you know that feature that's supposed to let you record not load a file
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.160]   How about you actually implement it rather than
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.400]   pertaining to implement it
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.400]   But but so that's why I want to throw some weight behind this
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.000]   I think this is and behind india web because this I really believe like
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.480]   That I believe that this is this is important to the future of a free and open web
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.440]   Yes, so thank you for doing this and and I wish I had the coding skills to do this
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.760]   But thanks to people like ben and erin who do
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:23.120]   We get the benefit of it. That's that's that that is the letter. Yeah. Yeah, by the way if you go to
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.920]   A lot of sites on the internet today. Uh, there's an internet slowdown
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:32.400]   Uh going on if you go to my site leoville.com for instance
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.280]   Uh, you'll see I do I chose to do the little tag in the upper right hand corner
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.880]   It says protect internet freedom to fit defend and net neutrality
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.800]   If there were
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.400]   Fast internet slow lines you'd still be waiting for this site to pop up
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:51.360]   And so you may see that all around the net today see that chan the upper right hand corner of my site
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:57.280]   Protect internet freedom. You can tell i'm posting on my upper right hand corner there but do but uh, but
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.920]   It that's not but
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:06.400]   And uh, you'll see the a bigger one in a lot of sites. Um, I went to a site this morning
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:14.240]   That had a big banner right covered the whole page of takeover. Um, you know what's unfortunate about protests
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.240]   The the sopa protest going dark everybody did it
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.360]   But you can only go to the well so often like once apparently right
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.760]   Because here we are. This is only the third time we try to do an internet wide protest and nobody's doing it
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.560]   So
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:38.800]   Well, I think that the the the threat is a little vague right now until man's it's very
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.480]   This is the right time to put pressure on the FCC. This is the right time to be heard
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:48.560]   As a community in an industry right but the consumer threat isn't as uh imminent
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.120]   Um, it's not reached iscis level yet. Right. Maybe that's it
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.080]   Uh, this is I remember now it was beer advocate. So if you go if you show my screen up
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.760]   Too late
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.200]   Don't do it again. Anyway, so it's doing a little bit of a bigger one
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:11.360]   Um, and then it says if sign our letter to lawmakers tell lawmakers protect internet freedom defend net neutrality and they make it very easy
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.920]   So this before you get to be your advocate you get this big pop-up
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:22.000]   But again, not you know, you see it on reddit you see it on a few sites, but it's not uh, not nearly as widespread
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.560]   um
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:30.240]   Um, here's the uh, see I don't see it on right. Yeah, they do a little one on uh on reddit
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.240]   It's over here in the right hand corner
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:39.200]   Uh, all right. I think we've done our nd web good deed for the day
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:45.840]   Let's talk about something bad a bad deed for the day. Are we worried about this?
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.560]   4.39 million gmail usernames and passwords published
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:58.160]   Google says no evidence is system or compromise. I saw this last night. I thought oh, yeah, yeah, a russian bitcoin coin forum
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.920]   Uh says they have almost 5 million
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.640]   Uh passwords company says it's not from a security breach
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:11.440]   We have no evidence our google says we have no evidence our systems have been compromised
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:16.560]   But whenever we become aware that accounts may have been we take steps to help users secure those accounts
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.720]   But if there are five million, oh, how else would you get them?
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:27.920]   That's the question is are there really five million new dreams and passwords or not the forum downloaded it and my email was in there
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.720]   Was it yep, and was the password correct?
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.400]   So the password was one that I had had about two years ago
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.640]   And I don't use it anymore like on google on google. Yes. Uh
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.240]   Uh, it's about
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.360]   That's what the next web is saying a quick analysis of the text file shows it includes mainly english Spanish and Russian accounts
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.680]   But it seems to combine older lists accumulated over a longer period of time
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:58.560]   So it could be a link to hacks of sites unrelated to gmail. Was it your google a password only Chad?
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.640]   Yeah, I was only my was it hadn't you hadn't used it anywhere else, right?
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:07.840]   The site has pulled the passwords off luckily I had semi good
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.640]   Password this goes to the discussion about payments earlier
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.360]   Can we not just assume now that there are going to be data breaches full stop
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.400]   And we have to have systems that operate with that that makes that meaningless
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:26.560]   Right. Well, it is going to get breached. That's one of the things google said if you have two fact
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.640]   This is one another reason you should turn on two factor
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.840]   Yeah, because even if they got your password, it's not enough
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.280]   um
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.680]   Does anybody read Russian?
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.840]   Google buzz uh, oh wait, man. Here's an american flag. I'm showing the site where you easily is
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:49.840]   Is leaked dot com, but let me click the american flights see if it's different translate
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:54.640]   I think it's I think you enter in your email here
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.360]   And it will tell you if your email was in the database of uh hacked emails
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:06.000]   I believe that's that's what it's going to do. It's pretty slow right now is leaked probably because I just gave out the address
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.360]   Is leaked dot com google says there wasn't a hack
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:18.160]   I don't know what to make of that if it really wills your google password jet obviously
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.800]   Yeah, well the thing is google doesn't store them. They're clear. They store them cryptids sorted properly
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.600]   So if they've got this they've either done the
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:31.200]   decryption run on a password file or they fished it in some way or what you to enter it from somewhere else
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.440]   Maybe they fished it. Maybe it's fishing
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.160]   Yeah, if google storing your passwords encrypted and salted
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:42.160]   Yes, which google is then there's you know, so just if you listen to security now, you know all this
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.880]   But many a surprisingly large number of sites just to store your name and password in text
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:53.200]   So if that data that file which is not necessarily visible in public, but if somebody could get into their systems and steal it they'd have it
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:59.120]   Uh better is to use some sort of encryption technology. Often it's a hashing
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:06.480]   Technology and what they'll do is they'll hash it in a known way and then when you log in they'll hash what you offer in the same known way
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.480]   And if the two hashes match
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.400]   then
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:16.080]   That's the right password. That's a little bit better, but the problem with hashes is something called rainbow tables
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.000]   It's possible if you can figure out how the hashing has been done
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.640]   Uh to create a table of possible
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:28.560]   Results and in effect a table of backward backwards unhashed stuff. So
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.400]   There's an even better way to store hash passwords. That's with salt
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.760]   Kevin you better explain that
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.920]   Um, that means you um
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.560]   Before the hash you add something to the the password so that it's um
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:49.920]   Even if you reverse the hash you you still get some some government doesn't tend the password. Yeah, um
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.560]   And sometimes they double or triple salt them. Yeah
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.920]   And that's and that's pretty effective if you do that
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.520]   It would it would be impractical for a hacker even if he owned the database to crack all the passwords in it
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:08.160]   Unfortunately, people use bad passwords sometimes and if you figure out one like if okay, so here's what's happened in some cases
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:15.760]   The hacker gets email password and password hint and some people in their password hint will write password equals
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.760]   password
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.200]   And then they look at the hash and they go well, I know that hash equals password
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.560]   And now they've got everybody who use the same crappy password
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.880]   Yes, so that's another so if you but if you use a good strong password and they're salting it and hashing it you're probably all right
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.480]   Yeah
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.920]   So
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:40.400]   And absolutely and and what's um, but what maybe this may be is it may be like the um image leak
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.640]   This may be um a compilation that someone's put together over a long period of time
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.040]   Um, and then has leaked it in one go
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:51.840]   So that the image leak last week was very much that it was it was a set of people who've been trading these things back and forth
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.760]   Right, um and somebody in that group leaked a chunk of it
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.720]   And this this looks looking at the reports of this
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.400]   It sounds like these are email addresses and passwords that have been
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.800]   Fished or collected or used over a long period of time that the people in the chat room are saying oh, yeah, that's I've it has some old
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:15.680]   Password of mine there. Um, so that this may be some hackers cache like that, right
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.360]   Google has rolled out the long-awaited
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:30.480]   Terrifyingly anticipated integration between hangouts and voice they haven't eliminated voice yet
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:36.880]   Um hangouts, but the good news is hangouts can now make voice calls your voicemail can go into hangouts
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.200]   You need to get the latest google hangouts and that's being rolled out slowly
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.560]   I hadn't gotten it this morning, but I was able to find the APK
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.280]   Don't recommend people do that
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.680]   Um, but but I did it for you so I could talk about it and it's pretty cool. I made a phone call
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.400]   Voice quality is quite good
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.680]   As always with google voice there's a slight bit of more latency than on a regular point-to-point phone call
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.240]   Uh, but I found it not bad at all
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:09.520]   I use it. I use it. I tend to use it from the browser using the nice mic like I have yes
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.320]   I do all the time. Yeah, so we've got a long call to make I'll do that so we're
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:18.320]   Had the open rights group, um advisory board meeting this morning, which is a call to the UK that lasts an hour and a half
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.920]   And so I could sit there at the computer and have the conversation and do it this way and it works quite well for that
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.000]   Um, I haven't spent much time using google voice on the phone
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.320]   But um the value again there is when traveling because it means that your number can can replicate somewhere where you have wifi
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.480]   And you can make calls. Yeah, so I've I've
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.720]   I've used it there when I've gone to the UK and my bank has done something stupid
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.600]   Um, I'm gonna have to call the 800 number. So you can't call it 800 numbers
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:51.200]   USA numbers from the UK, but because of my google voice number is an american number. I can call it from that so there's there's a set of
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.720]   uh
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.960]   like arbitrageing around the brokenness of the phone system that the voice makes very useful
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.960]   So it's nice to see that they're still supporting it and keeping that running the downside on it is that hangouts is becoming more and more of a beast
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.360]   Yeah, it is
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:11.920]   Uh, it was already too big for just using for SMSes, but now it's got to but it's kind of cool because if you're so I did
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:17.680]   You know, there's a couple of reasons to use hangouts if you're using android where device hangouts allows you to reply from your watch
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:21.440]   Not all of the SMS apps let you do that evolve will do that
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.040]   That's kind of nice. But also now when I choose a contact
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.600]   I can choose whether I want to hang out them SMS them or call them
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.320]   And that's kind of nice too
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.480]   much like facebook messenger
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.600]   Yes, facebook messenger will do that too
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.920]   Well, they've they've had a um a call that is that is a white call
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.960]   They're scott they're partnered with skype
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.600]   I was though it was it was it?
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.640]   Mm-hmm. Okay
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   So that's kind of nice. I mean
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:59.360]   Um, but uh, I'll use hangouts, uh, I guess for my SMS app until it finally I it's it's so it feels so big compared to just a plain old SMS app
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.320]   There's so much stuff in there
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.880]   Well, this because they've got hangouts on air and all these other things in there
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:11.440]   So I did I did I hangouts on air with somebody last week. It was it was like, well, where do these extra UX come from and why are they hard to use?
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.160]   Yeah, that's the unfortunately. That's the net. I on the other hand, I like
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.160]   adding all these new features on the other hand, it's it's uh,
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.440]   It's I kind of like the facebook model of separating everything out
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:30.720]   Into single apps that do one thing. Well, the old Linux old Unix point of view right do one thing. Well, and then pipe
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.640]   Yeah, well, that's new sounding here like you're talking anywhere again
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:40.080]   That's that's very but that's I think the separation there is um
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.000]   I think the app separation is driven by notifications
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.680]   Um
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.200]   Permissions because the permissions. Yes. Let's gets really long
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.240]   Right. So but so hangouts and facebook messenger have a similar set of
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.800]   permissions and sort of notification modal
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.880]   Um, whereas you don't want that you wouldn't really want that wrapped up in your
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.440]   Your facebook app and your google plus app
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.720]   Um because they you get a different set of notifications from them and you have a different idea of what those are for
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.800]   Because one is interpersonal communication and one is publishing
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.200]   The other thing that's nice is hangouts now can do images
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:24.160]   Or uh voice can now do images because the text messaging and voice was did not support us uh mms. It was only s
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.320]   Oh, so they fixed that. That's good. So now i can send
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.240]   photos locations rich text messages
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.240]   Using hangouts via sms. I believe that's the case
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:41.280]   That's good because that was that was clunky before you see somebody sent you an image it would give you a one or whatever
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.520]   Uh, it's
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.600]   2.3. Is that right? I think it's version 2.3 so you can look and hang out and see
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:51.440]   You'll you'll get the updates started going out today. It'll be over the next few days
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.160]   Um, if you look at help and feedback
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.000]   Uh, it's two point my current version of hangouts is 2.3
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.840]   7 5067 996
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:07.760]   Make sure you have that version it's 2.3 or later. I think all right
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:13.520]   Uh, I had 2.2 this morning and I actually found an APK somebody posted on google plus and took of it
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:16.640]   Did a very stupid thing which was downloaded and installed it
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.240]   Um, which means now the nsa has everything in my phone
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:25.680]   Wait till it best thing to do wait till google pushes the update you'll get it soon
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:33.680]   Google is also putting a password generator. I think it's a good idea a password generator in chrome if you have chrome canary
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:40.080]   Uh, you will have now the ability to generate a password. This is actually I think coming from the chromium project
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.240]   Um
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.760]   Yaddick so it's a good idea. It's a fix 181 compatible automated password generator
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.400]   Spits out a strong and pronounceable password
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.800]   You do have to use canary and then enable a couple of flags
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:04.400]   Uh, this should replace then this would replace one pass you're saying no because it doesn't remember it
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.640]   And I don't recommend it. Oh, just a generator. That's a generator. Well google will remember passwords, but I don't
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.280]   I mean chrome remember that's right. Yeah, but I
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:19.120]   I'm not crazy about the idea of the browser remembering the password frankly
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:22.080]   I I prefer to keep my passwords encrypted
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:27.280]   It depends how how they do it. Yeah, the value is that it lets you do it between machines, right?
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.560]   Yeah, it's you're making it convenience versus security trade-off there as ever. Right. So
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:38.880]   I still suggest using last pass but hey, it's a step. It's a step forward. That's good
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.320]   We're doing the change log just in case you didn't know so we just didn't want to let anybody know
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.960]   Because then they messed it up a compare it to Gina who does it so
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:54.240]   And finally google play music. I'm sorry movies and tv on iOS. Let's you download and play videos offline
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.320]   I don't think you can do it on and right can you I don't think so, but it can you?
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.120]   Oh, yeah
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:07.040]   And that might also do it on chrome so I can do it on my chrome apparently you could not do it on iOS
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.360]   I didn't know that didn't either
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:14.800]   So if you're an iOS user, that's how I watch movies and shows on long flights such as the one I just left
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.440]   Okay, so yeah, so do you is it like a pin or is it actually say explicitly download this movie?
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.640]   It's a little pin. Yeah, it's a pin. Okay. It's like music. Yeah, okay
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:28.880]   I love I love google play music and I do do that for the trips. I download
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:33.680]   Beautiful music to listen to google has unveiled the cartographer
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.920]   It's a indoor mapping backpack everybody ought to have one of these
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.520]   Where everybody's useful is glass
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.440]   Only 10 times heavier did I say 10 a thousand times heavier
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:54.080]   Uh, you wear the backpack you walk through the building the floor plan automatically generated in real time
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.680]   Where also uses a tablet to adds points of interest
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:04.560]   It's a bit
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:10.880]   What's the what's the what's the the version of an android tablet the map 3d map spaces?
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.480]   What's I called again an android tablet 3d map spaces?
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:18.720]   You know what I'm talking about old chat room. Maybe spill no. No, you mean the software that did it or
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.760]   There's there's it is the project
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:26.560]   Tango hango. Yes, Jeff needles remembers project tango
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:29.600]   Thank you for that boy a popsicle
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.000]   potentially do this
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.200]   A tap the project tango tablet
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.960]   Ah, that's neat. I don't remember. I'm just gonna on vacation where they came out with this
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:45.680]   Yeah, the idea is you have mapping devices that you can map the whole world everything should be mapped
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:50.240]   Right. Okay. You sure project tango was an April fools joke
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.600]   No, no, there it is
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:24:04.640]   You sure it wasn't an April fools, Jeff
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.120]   All right, it's an I can augmented reality kind of a thing
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.800]   No, it's a
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:20.640]   Inside of buildings. Okay. Well, this must replace project magic. I hope blind people could I think it's working in conjunction with or in the
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.280]   Conjection, okay. All right. Well, they're yeah, they've got multiple ways of doing this so they've they've had
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.480]   You know the street view cars and they had street view bikes. I don't have street view backpacks
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.520]   um at one point they had a service
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.160]   Was part of google local where they'd come to your business and photographic for you
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.920]   Yeah, third parties do that. We did that with our with the twit studios
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:47.120]   You can if you search for twit llc on google maps you can go inside and tour around
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:54.560]   I like that. I think this is all variations on a theme of that. How do we get better indoor data inside? Yeah
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:59.280]   Yeah, because you know google maps has that for certain buildings. It has interior maps
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   Um things like that, but they obviously won't walk through as well as just mapping
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:07.600]   Did you toss the world?
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:14.480]   By the way, we were talking about hashes. There is an encryption technology s h a one that is known bad
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:20.000]   It's been cracked. It's not very it works, but it's not it's very strong google has decided to remove support
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.520]   For certificates encrypted with s h a one
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:26.960]   from chrome
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.960]   Uh, this is really interesting google has seems to have decided
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.720]   That they can use their immense weight. They're an immense cloud
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:40.560]   To get people to do something that google in its infinite wisdom thinks is right
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:46.640]   Remember a couple of weeks ago. They said you'll get a better search ranking if you are using secure http
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:56.480]   Well google says most of the web is is using an insecure algorithm 90 of websites that use ssl use s h a one
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.840]   For their certificates
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.320]   Unfortunately, it's dangerously weak has been for some time gets weaker every year
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.560]   There's a replacement s h a two google announced if you use chrome
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.640]   You're going to start seeing warnings for sites that say they're secure
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:19.760]   But aren't the first set of warnings will hit before christmas and we'll keep getting more stern
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:26.240]   google's turning into like a headmaster or a vice principal or something
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.520]   The geek marma
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:33.120]   You're not secure over the next six months eventually even sites
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:38.800]   With the s h a one certificates that are don't expire till 2016 will be given a yellow card
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.680]   S h a has got to go. What do you think kevin? I mean
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:48.080]   On the one hand I agree. I mean people shouldn't be using this certificate
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:54.880]   So this is I mean this was a big thing at indy web camp uk this weekend lots of people working on how to get their sites up on ssl
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.560]   um
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:01.040]   um the h ups and makes you how to do that and there's a series of sites that um
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.840]   I've posted the indy web camp
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:08.320]   um dot com slash ssl page which talks about different levels of security and
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:14.000]   um what you need to do and how you work your way through the levels and when there are sites that will measure your um
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.320]   Right check your site for students. So so part of this is not using
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:23.440]   um s h a one not using things that that fail not making
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:30.240]   We may never know what he was about to say
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:36.720]   And then sure kevin's took kevin rose
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:40.480]   at 258 kevin ro kevin marks
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.640]   at
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.880]   Who's kevin ros? I don't know uh
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.240]   258 on september 10 one time on your watcher
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.960]   I don't know yes and well london time it's 1058 just so you know
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:57.760]   All right, I think it is a little in school marmos and yet it's a good thing
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.120]   It is
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.840]   Hey, did you see the uh reveal we're gonna get kevin back
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.480]   Did you see the reveal for the moto x the new moto x
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.440]   Some of it I was the other thing I wanted to ask you just because i'm curious for your reaction particularly as a moto x
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.520]   I want to buy it. I can't
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.480]   um
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.480]   Andy and aco went to chicago
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.600]   uh
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.440]   And uh, you know, so it was at their chicago headquarters. We had talked about it moto rola announced exactly what I had hoped they would announce
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:25.680]   Which is a high res 1080p larger screen 5.2 inch
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:30.960]   Moto x with an improved camera and he says yes indeed. It's much improved 13 megapixels
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.480]   um
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.920]   And uh, it's everything I wanted and it has more commands
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:39.040]   It's smarter still has that always on
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:44.080]   Yeah, I love it. It you know one of the things it was always a little issue for me. It has that
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:51.600]   What do they call it? It would it would show little information it would pulse information while it was off
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:57.120]   Now you can wave your hand over it because they have infrared sensors and it'll go. Oh you want to know yeah, and they'll show you
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:00.000]   They call that active display active display. You don't have to get it
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.360]   Probably active displays. You'd have to look at exactly the right time
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:08.080]   Oh good. But now you can wave your hand and they'll say oh the time is and you have three minutes plus
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:12.240]   I like the one plus this feels very vanilla
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.280]   One plus yeah, it's a it's a great kind of vanilla
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.720]   Yes android device really nice nothing wrong with it
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:28.320]   One thing I'm waiting for I you you're you're a love with a motor x so and the added commands. I'm lost in africa, but
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:32.640]   Next nexus. What's that gonna be is it gonna be what we know?
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:39.440]   Keep hearing rumors. We also hear rumors that google's not gonna name it nexus anything
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.160]   Right, it's gonna be just nexus or something
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.960]   Or they're gonna keep five. I don't know
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.120]   um
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.120]   You really love your nexus is don't you?
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.920]   I do I do they're very comfortable
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:55.520]   They're finna let you know I went when I was at efog
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:02.400]   Uh the the efas amazing. Have you ever been to the efah? No, I'd love to go to efah. It's the largest
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:08.320]   Consular product show. I guess anywhere and the reason I was there was to speak they never had a program before they just had the
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:14.640]   Show cool. So but I went up and wandered as best my knee my aging knees could take me through the show
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.360]   And right above us in the the city box
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:29.920]   Uh was the sam song and and you know just amazing stuff sam sah
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:33.840]   Schools. I mean it's really quite amazing. They're looking at that as
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.520]   Companies that have service touches with public they want to be there
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:45.680]   And so they do some phenomenal things and the refrigerators are great and this is that why do they have to keep on ruining the phones with all the
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.440]   Garbage
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.160]   Ah, that's the only way to frustrate people because they do need stuff
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:53.680]   I touched the the phone with the thing on the side. Yeah the edge
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:58.480]   Think yeah, it's it. I feel like that's a very it's innovative. It's an interesting idea
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:02.720]   It really is it really is it kind of works and you kind of roll it around and I kind of like that
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.880]   They have a gigantic watch ridiculous. It is like where I fall here
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:13.040]   Uh, but but sam sah does some really really neat stuff and it's impressive and and um
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:18.640]   Well, we know there's a new nexus tablet and vidia has confirmed that it's going to be built by htc
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:24.400]   Uh, so that seven will be replaced by a non-disconverter well
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.120]   Nvidia says so
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   Good legs
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.800]   Uh, I don't know is it eight inches. I think it's eight inches. I'm not sure
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.920]   Let's do that. I love seven seven was perfect
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:40.080]   Yeah, uh, but it's that new fast tegra k1
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:45.280]   Um, which is a really nice processor by the way if you're going to get an iphone
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:50.560]   The reason to get the iphone is this processor is just blazingly fast if you like games on a
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:53.280]   A five and a half inch should be great
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:56.640]   So the tag that's the same chip that's going into the new chromebooks. Yeah
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:02.080]   Um, unless i've got this completely muddled, but I think so and then there
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:06.320]   So we know they're going to keep the nexus name, which is is good. That means there probably will be a nexus six
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:10.160]   Uh rumors say probably this year, but we don't know
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:15.520]   Uh, maybe it will be time to uh coordinate with the release of l
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.160]   Right. We don't know the time of that
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.680]   Yeah, my problem is i'm not you
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.240]   So I would I would have you know like changing your phones do you
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:30.800]   Well, that actually is a pain in the bot, but but besides that it's also just kind of a money thing that after having just bought the one plus
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.880]   I can't really justify buying both
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.600]   the motorwax and the nexus
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.480]   Well, look at this. This is a tweet a tweet
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:44.800]   from the android twitter account of a nexus. No one's ever seen with almost an edge to edge
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.640]   The screen big phone. It looks pretty big. I would guess that's five and a half
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.080]   Um
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.520]   I don't know
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:00.720]   Could be a mock-up. We don't know. I saw the new note for also. That's big. Isn't it?
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:06.400]   Well, no, that's the same size as this they i'll put this phone right over it and it's the same really but the screen's bigger
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.760]   My notes felt so huge more pix more pixers
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:15.200]   Yeah, it's 500. They're not getting the up to I think close to 500 ppi. It's nice
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:22.720]   Um the nexus six would be five and a half inches according to the rumor mill
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.600]   Um
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.920]   I don't know maybe larger maybe even larger
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:35.520]   Thing is it's all rumors. You don't know and the x1 is here. Well, it will be here sometime this month. They say they I also like
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:39.040]   Unknown. Oh, wait a minute. No, they did say a price
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:43.360]   They did say the pix is cheap. It's uh, was it 550 450?
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:47.680]   Yeah, it's not uh, it's not as expensive as you'd expect
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:50.320]   And you have the turbocharger, which is also nice
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.880]   You know all Qualcomm chips support this and I think almost all
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.280]   uh
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.400]   flagship models have have this high speed charging. I don't I didn't know that. Yeah, it's not clear
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.800]   If they're talking about something different from the Qualcomm high speed charging
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.040]   Got it
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:13.360]   Uh, they're claiming you can half charge it in 15 minutes if that that's pretty darn fast
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:20.000]   By the way, the I think the HTC one has that in the Qualcomm 801, but you'd have to buy a higher power
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.680]   Dongle for it and you will also with a car speed is the real issue that I agree
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.640]   So I see on the show how I drove the um, um,
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:33.360]   Um, BMW electric car. Yeah, you said you liked it
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:37.760]   I did I talk about that right, but it's it's the speed of charging. It's gonna be the issue
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:43.760]   It's not so much the capacity. It's how fast you can recover. Well, and in a new with a car you have to put a 240 fault
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.680]   Uh, that's true
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:50.960]   I don't want the here's my concern. I are the the moto hint the little tiny i want the hint
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.520]   Because that's called joe Hanson in my ear
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.760]   Oh, yeah, well, it looks just like the little earbud
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.480]   That he was wearing in her
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:06.480]   But I have wacky ears. I could never wear apple earbuds never never never I would you could probably fall right out
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.040]   Yeah, that's okay. Thank you. Right?
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.680]   And by the way, I don't think the battery life is gonna be great on that because all they talk about is 10 hours
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:17.200]   With the included case that has a big battery in it
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:21.920]   You charge up and I think it's I'm guessing it's three hours battery life on the hand
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.760]   That's not a lot. You know, I don't go through battery on my headset a lot. I use it leave it in the car
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:34.960]   Think about it. It's so tiny. I just I just I really like the idea of a of a moda rolla ecosystem
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:38.400]   And I wish the 360 had more moda rolla specific stuff
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.040]   And the hint and the in the whole thing and i'm gonna be a moda rolla cyborg
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.560]   And i'm gonna be talking to myself a lot
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.520]   And the Chinese government, I don't care
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.640]   I mean, I mean in the annoying state of like I need to buy a new phone, but I don't know which one to buy because they're all about to change
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.240]   It's very confusing right now
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.160]   And maybe i should just buy your one plus when you get bored
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:02.480]   I'll tell you my one plus actually I think I think father robert wants it. We can get you a one plus
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:07.680]   Invite we were saying when you were gone. This is I like the one plus it was very vanilla. It's not there's nothing you go
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.920]   Oh, I love it or
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:15.280]   Vanilla is what I want. I don't want this this Samsung. Oh, we've replaced all your apps with another app
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.720]   That's almost the same, but not quite. Yeah, it's not like no. It's very pure
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:22.960]   I want a nice clean, you know, I buy one of the Nexus phones. So if one plus is like a Nexus phone and that's great
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:28.320]   It's well it's cyanogen mod. It's not pure google, but it's pretty close enough. Oh, yeah
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.000]   I think you'd like it
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.280]   The point is it's not near the Samsung one is like there's two apps for everything because they had to make their own version of all the google ones
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.400]   Right, which is which is just horrible horrible
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.000]   Speaking of which one phone I know you're not gonna get the amazon fire phone
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:47.280]   They're pretty much giving it away
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:51.600]   What I talked to a clerk at the AT&T store
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:52.240]   Yeah
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:58.480]   After weeks go and I said are those things selling he said no and those that do sell come back
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.560]   Yeah, nobody wants that phone. Why?
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.880]   Just don't do enough
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:09.280]   If they I you know they blew it they should have just made an android. I don't know why it's not android make a pure android phone
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.400]   You can add all those little juicy firefly and mayday
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.840]   Uh, well, it may be they don't want to pay the um the with google tags. It's not that expensive. Is it?
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.240]   But it would but it would mean they couldn't use their app store
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.720]   at all
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.400]   Because part of the with the with google
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:33.120]   You have to place you use the place door not not your app store and amazon wants to use their up store
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.400]   So guess what?
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.720]   It's a it's a mutual strategy tax problem, right?
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.760]   People want the google store and the google apps and the google services
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:50.320]   New york times talking about talking to bay area san francisco bay area at and t stores salesmen said the fire had performed dismally quote
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:54.800]   We got special shirts stabbed up for the staffed up for the launch then nothing
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:58.160]   He said we've sold a total of 10
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:02.640]   fires at a smaller store two salesmen said they'd sold one
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:10.880]   Fire gene monster and analyst at piper jaffrey said well, we had modest expectations and the phone seems to be shy even of those
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.320]   99 cents now for a fire phone
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.960]   And I and I wouldn't even get it at that price. No, because you're still committed to
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.360]   Stupid and it's 18 t only
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.160]   They spent a lot of money on that ad silly ad campaign the kid. Yeah
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.960]   um firing things. Yeah
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:34.640]   No, no, I have one you want if you want to
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.280]   I'll send you either either of you
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.440]   You're welcome to my 18 t fire phone. It's sitting on my desk drawer
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:44.320]   I tried to use it
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.840]   Basically, I need to trade phones with my son. So he he gets more than I need to buy a new one
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:53.360]   Yeah, because he's got some two-year-old android and it's broken. So yeah, I need to get something new
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.400]   But I'm not sure what to get because everything's like coming out this week or rather
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.800]   Everything's being announced this week and I'm actually on sale yet. Yeah, I mean I think the next one looks really good
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.920]   The new act I calling it the x1 the new the 2014 Motorola x really looks nice. That's I think could be my phone
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.320]   It's that or the iphone five
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:13.120]   Six plus it's what either that either that I'm not switching that back to that ecosystem no way
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.240]   I
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.800]   According according to a link to a tech blogger and I kind of a not an not known tech blogger
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:28.720]   Tk tech news.com mo to roll is planning to release eight new devices before christmas
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:34.000]   So we haven't even seen everything yet
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.720]   I I would I think I'm gonna live in the Motorola x hint
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:46.960]   Moto 360 world for a little while. I just I feel like that's where you know, I have to decide what to take to London
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:52.800]   I need something that'll work on t-mobile because t-mobile has you know internet for international roaming
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:58.400]   That's the other attraction of the of the nexus five for me because it it does that yeah, and it works very well
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:04.880]   I've used that but I'm going to I'm going to London next week as well. This is christmas off to university. So fun. Any oh, yeah, that's right
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.600]   Well, they certainly make us make us next announcement wasn't t but we're gonna make another
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.760]   John ledger was saying something. I don't know. He said something was going on today, but I haven't seen the reports of it yet. Yeah, they
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:19.920]   Chatroom anyone could have been tweeting about it some reports. Yeah, john said oh watch
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:24.960]   Okay, uh, the uncarrier 7.0 has now been released but that ramey thing
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:32.480]   A man spray painting a cloud on a wall
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.640]   Um the man I think is john himself
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.560]   Um
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.520]   Mobile to cell phones that call and text on wifi
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:47.680]   Well, they've been doing that for ages. In fact, that's one thing apple announced was that they were going to support wifi calling for t-mobile
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:54.240]   Um, but that the androids had that for a few years the press conference just happened. I don't
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:57.600]   I'm working on
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.600]   Must mustn't be big news
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.600]   Uh
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.880]   All right, I think we I think we've kind of mined every
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:12.080]   You know, there's an advantage to what we call in journalism vote-aid
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.840]   Which is like put the in from the news
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.480]   Up front up
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.000]   Yep
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000]   They're gonna support wifi
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.800]   phone
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:28.000]   integration as far as 30,000 feet
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.680]   Oh
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:34.640]   Well in the sky not okay. Oh, I see right I was gonna say that's
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:38.880]   So when they say in the clouds, they mean you can actually make
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:44.720]   I know this makes no sound replace your entire wifi. That is the recommended approach
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:50.400]   You can have it as an additional cell spot if you like what the hell is this serve parts of the home with poor coverage?
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.480]   Well, that's um, that's a femto cell. That's something
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.320]   Every carrier offers t-mobiles also made a deal with go-go. Oh, I get it to provide customers with free
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.200]   Text messaging and voicemail on go-go based flights. This is dumb
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:06.080]   Forget it. We didn't we didn't we don't care
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:10.160]   But I like t-mobile. I'm not saying anything bad about t-mobile
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:17.840]   Because I can go I can take it to London and get international roaming at 2g speeds, but that's better than nothing for free
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:21.760]   What should I see when i'm in London Kevin anything exciting?
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.120]   I'm uh, do I think they're to see any sites any hotspots any tourist attractions?
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:31.040]   Um, well, he's London theater is the main thing to see in London
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:34.480]   Yeah, you know actually I want I was gonna go see some on the west end and I don't know what to see
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:39.200]   The national theater has this curious incident of the dog in the night, which was my one. I loved the novel
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:41.200]   Do you know anything about the play?
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:45.680]   I haven't seen I didn't know much about okay. I'll show us my son about this. He's you know, he
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:52.240]   Ask him if you could buy one ticket to a show in the west standards are anywhere in London. What show should I go see?
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:54.240]   I will ask him that but the
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.320]   As leo would you like to go visit the guardian?
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.160]   No
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:58.960]   Okay
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.960]   It's a newspaper. What am I gonna see there?
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:05.200]   Oh, you could you could maybe do things with them. No, I don't want to do anything. I'm not working
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:07.280]   At least it won't even want us to a meetup
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:11.200]   There you go. We are going to the iTunes festival on tuesday to see plathico the mingle
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:14.400]   That's cool. That'll be fun
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.760]   So the things that things I said recommend in London is theater there's the various ways to do that if you go to Leicester Square
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:25.760]   Yeah, there's a booth in the middle of it called tkts. Yes. It gives you discounted tickets for that day
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:28.240]   Yeah, we have that in the New York City. Yeah, I know yeah
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.880]   Yeah, but there's also like 20 other places that will say they're half price tickets, but aren't but that one's actually
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.400]   Okay, tickets is okay. Yeah, they do the exactly the same thing in Times Square
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:44.320]   So I recommend that um and yeah, the musicals tend to be full but the the actual live theater is is usually there's usually stuff available there
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.720]   No, many, no, many goes to see theater
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.400]   Oh, no none of them. They do but you can see any Disney movie on stage. They got them all. Yeah
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:59.680]   But but you know, I recommend actual theater because that's um, I think the curious incident of the dog and then I ask
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:05.600]   Ask your son about that. Oh, I see what he thinks about that. I think he's I think he's putting a play on so but he probably won't be in time for you
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:10.480]   That's interesting. There's a lot of good student theater as well that I'm finding out through him
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:13.440]   the other things that are touristy
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.760]   There you know, there's lots of obvious ones the ones that are sort of subtle and different is if you go to
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:25.280]   It won seven Olivier awards. Is that a good thing? Yes, that's a good thing. I would see that. I would go and see that
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:28.560]   Including test you play
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.320]   Yeah, yeah
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.360]   um
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.240]   So
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:35.040]   If you go to St Paul's Cathedral or Westminster Abbey
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:39.200]   If you go to coral even song there, that's what I'm gonna do
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:41.920]   A) you don't have to pay
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:47.600]   To go in which you do the rest of the time and B) you actually hear coral even signing in a place that sounds amazing
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.960]   I love even song
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:51.760]   So that's do that do that in both of them look up when it's there
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:56.640]   Um, because it gets you a feel for why that is that every evening or is it just one evening a week or
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.480]   Um, look at them. I think it's every evening in the in the cathedrals
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.320]   Um, but Westminster Abbey. I want to go there and see that
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:10.240]   Westminster Abbey and St Paul's they're both doing it. Oh, some polls also. Okay, but they're both spectacular. Yeah, so that's good
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.320]   Um, so that's a good what else
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:17.760]   The other you can go and attend it. I'm not sure parliament said it. You can go and attend debates in parliament really?
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.560]   Yep, we just line up outside. Oh, I'd love to do that
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:25.200]   And you get to watch watch that see what's on and go to the house doors and house for commons
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.480]   Um
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:31.600]   That's that's that's a very English thing that you can do that's also free and um, you know
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:36.720]   Sort of traditional and not too to us and it depends what they're debating it can be interesting. It can be very darling
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:43.280]   Can we just them like reading out the constituents complaints? Yeah, but but it's it's it's it's it's worth visiting the parliament building that way
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:46.480]   What else I hear the good walking walking tours are fun
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:52.400]   Yeah, there's the the nice thing about London, especially if you get the wet weather is that it's a very walkable city
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.840]   Um, yeah, you get you get sort of increasing
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.000]   You get sucked into the tube because the tube connects everywhere sounds painful
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.880]   Yeah, but the thing is you look at the tube map you go
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:06.560]   Oh, we should go there by by going this line and then less line and if you actually look on the physical map
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.560]   You go, oh, I can just walk there in three
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.120]   Two minutes. Yeah, and actually there's an app that I recommend we're staying in mayfair
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.880]   So we're kind of central which is not well say you're fairly central, but but the thing is that there's
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:22.640]   London has lots of yeah like many like any real city has lots of different neighbors that different bits in
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:27.120]   Yeah, um, so getting a sense of the different neighborhoods is nice may fair these days can be a bit empty
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.520]   Because lots of people from overseas have bought flat so they don't live in oh dear
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:35.840]   So there's a certain um, it's it's fancy and it's nice and there's some
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:42.080]   Historic buildings, but there's not a lot of life there compared to other bits of life and where people will actually walk around and live
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:45.680]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I can't wait. It's gonna be a lot of fun and there's a
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:51.840]   So tip tip of the week if as we have done wait a minute. We're gonna take a break so hold your tip of the week
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:56.640]   But it's relates that I will do that okay. We will have a a traveler's tip of the week
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:01.680]   With kevin marks coming up in just a little bit your jeff's a number and I have a tool
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:06.640]   Some might say I am a tool our show brought to you by shutters stock
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.440]   Dot com the best place to go to get stock
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.200]   photos video footage illustrations vectors

[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:57.280]   We have the 25 image a day subscription a lot of businesses do that
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.840]   So we have plenty of images all the time royalty free. They have an incredible app
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:06.160]   Want a webby award for their ipad app now. It's on google as well on android as well
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:12.560]   Last week they added 352 000 new images that means you're pretty much guaranteed to find whatever you're looking for
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:14.880]   And the search tool is so good
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:21.120]   That uh, you know, you need it when you have that many images 40 million images. So there's london
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.080]   Images of the gherkin. Is that what they call it the gherkin? They do
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.600]   and uh, what's the other building that has a
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.320]   Has a name?
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:33.360]   The sliver
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.360]   I mean, there's the shard which the shard
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:37.520]   There's the walkie-talkie, which is
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:43.520]   Every building has a name not such a complimentary name, but so you say london, but then I can narrow it down. Look at
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.160]   I can refine this search so I can have
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:50.720]   Photos vectors or illustrations. I could say are horizontal or vertical ill
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:54.240]   I can say I can have different categories
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:01.920]   I can exclude keywords. I can say only images with people only images without people I can have more people options any gender
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:03.680]   Age
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:09.840]   Ethnus, I mean you can drill down here by the way if you sign in now and you don't need a credit card to do that
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.280]   You can get free images as I mentioned, but you can also do the lightbox which means you can save images share them with people
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:20.400]   It's great for inspiration and if you decide to buy we've got a great deal 20 off

[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:56.400]   Normally, Gina would start with a tip. We'll let Kevin Marks give us a tip and it doesn't have to be a google tip
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:02.160]   Well, it's a it's an app tip which is um city mapper. I got it
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:09.040]   So this is um, it's particularly good in london. They've just had a San Francisco
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:13.120]   Um Bay area, but it's particularly in london because london has um
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.880]   A bunch of ways of getting around it. It solves that actual problem. I just told you of okay
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.480]   I'm here. I want to get there
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:23.200]   Which tube line should I take or should I walk or should I get one of those city bikes or you know?
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:26.880]   How do I how do I get around and it does it in a in a more um
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:31.360]   In a better user interface than google map stars. It's um, so
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.640]   Give me somewhere get me home get me to work add places meet me somewhere. We'll send
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.200]   a text message with
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.200]   and and it shows you uh
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.800]   buses
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:43.840]   tube
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:45.200]   uh bicycle
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:49.600]   Yeah, so it'll show you buses walking um cycling it'll take into account
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:57.840]   The bikes you can rent from the city and tell you where to go and get those. Yeah, so they have a city bike rental thing. Huh? That's really cool. Yeah, so um
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:04.400]   So that's that's my tip for it particularly for london because they started it there and it's very good at london
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:08.560]   or my london and friends say say yes, we should use this google maps is not as good
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:14.080]   And and my friends friends who moved to san risco from this and I really miss city map. I said no
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:21.200]   San Francisco too. That's good. Oh and another london travel tip is um barra market. What's that? Um
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:24.000]   It's a food market
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.400]   On the south bank of the Thames just a bit along from the tape from the tape the new tape
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:34.240]   Um and it's really good. It's if you're missing your sort of san francisco gourmet nurse go there
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.760]   All right. Mm-hmm. We're gonna have we're staying at clergy. So I thought we'd have high tea
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:46.000]   Clamages high tea is very nice. It's like the blobby feel like a member of the blooms a great
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.800]   Huh that's that's how i said it i would do me do too
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:56.240]   I'm hoping allen bennet and stroll in and we can have a nice conversation steve and friday join us. It'll be such fun
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:59.600]   It well i'm a scon
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:03.600]   He used to hang out in um
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.440]   um regents
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:12.000]   What you call it? Regents part road where my office was in london. He would go to the cafe and he'd be sitting there chatting to people
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.520]   It's all right
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:19.760]   So i'm but i'm actually north londonish. I'm a huge alan bennet fan. I love his books
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.960]   Oh, see see if he's got any of his stuff. You might have a show. Huh? I have a show on
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:28.960]   I'll have to check. I didn't even think of that so funny
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:32.240]   um
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:34.320]   former beyond the fringer
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.640]   oh, yes, oh, yes
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.960]   Long with peter cook and deadly more
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:43.600]   jeff javis a number of the week my friend um so
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.080]   I just saw this on twitter. Thank goodness got solved because it was saved by the bell here
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:55.760]   Uh, we wonder why does apple have bigger screens coming out? Well, uh flurry has data showing the bigger screens are used more of course
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:58.320]   thaw
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:02.560]   Well, yes and no you think all the little screens more convenient. It's hard to get the big thing out
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:09.440]   It looks silly. It looks this is that yeah, but no people use them more and that's why they're coming out so there's some data from from um
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:15.120]   And of course apple wants you to use them more because the more you use it the more money they make
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.600]   Exactly the happier you are too
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:21.840]   So fablets now account for 11% of
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:25.840]   Obsession usage wow of old bones
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:31.280]   See people mocked me. I have to I have to say because I said early on I want big
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:37.440]   You were you were and they and they said it looks like a candy bar next to your head and all sorts of stuff
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:42.800]   I know this is the last one point that seemed too big and this this now seems quite normal. You get used to it, don't you?
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:46.960]   Oh, yeah, I don't understand the direction because if you look at a classic telephone
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:49.760]   It's eight inches long and has a thing that goes to you
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:53.040]   Big aren't they and all you could do is talk to it?
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:58.000]   Could you do is talk to it? Whereas this thing is like well, I've got this on my ear, but the microphone is somewhere around my cheek
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.440]   It's not big enough. You're right
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:06.480]   These should be bigger and they should wrap around and they should have a shoulder thing
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:10.480]   Those
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:14.000]   Um
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.480]   Well, that's not a surprise and I and it's very interesting because apple really made a big jump for this
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.400]   This is an example of tim cook
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:24.720]   Saying i'm gonna do my own thing Steve Jobs. It was pretty clear. He did not like the idea of a big screen
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:25.920]   He could have done it earlier, right?
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:30.240]   Well, they did but they did it with the iPad that was the thing that is right there were two there were two good sizes
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:32.640]   Right, um and and Steve just
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:35.440]   Followed on your fingers joke and word stuff
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:39.440]   And they're still kind of living in that one thing about this announcement was watching the written
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.680]   Go ahead
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:45.840]   Well, the design thinking for iOS is still in that world
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:49.280]   There are there are small things in your hand that you have to use with one hand with your thumb
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:55.920]   Then there are big things that you hold out here and read that are that are iPads and that mental model of that dichotomy
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.880]   Define the design thinking for iOS
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:02.800]   Such that you build an iPhone app or you build an iPad app, right?
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:05.600]   But you don't think of it as a continuum
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.400]   And now they have to think it was a continuum because there's a continuum of sort of sizes and the iPhone line
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:15.760]   Um and the other and the other reason that that you needed that split was that this screen was
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:20.800]   320 by 480 and couldn't really show much and the other one was a was a full-size screen
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:24.800]   Whereas now this screen has more pixels than the original iPad does
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:26.640]   um
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.840]   And so thinking about everything in pixel terms makes much less sense
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.280]   Um because you can't you can't see the pixels anymore
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:39.280]   Um, so I think we're we're we're gonna have a transition into people designing in a much more
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:43.760]   um vector-based smooth way and having things very
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:50.240]   Depending on how big is the thing how big is the thing you're holding and how big is your finger are the two sort of key variables?
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:57.680]   Um as opposed to is this a specific size? Is this a iPad or an iPhone and to some extent web designers gone that way already?
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:00.640]   We've had a lot of responsive design and thinking about
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:05.680]   Um, how do we make this the same site working different places and how do we add stuff in for the bigger screens?
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:08.000]   um, I think that
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000]   That will come into its own
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:14.560]   In the broader design community on iOS as well when they've been able to say up to now
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:19.440]   Oh, there are two things there are phones and there are there are iPads and they're they're different and we should do separate things for them
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.480]   And the realize that there is actually now a continuum across there
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:28.080]   Um, and that will map to and that may map to making things work more smoothly across different platforms as well
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:34.000]   I you know, I haven't spent that much time thinking about it. I just like to have i'm old
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:38.320]   I want to see bigger pictures. I'm like, yeah, and I just think using it as a camera
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:42.400]   It's going to be great now the birk has made some mockups and you'll be interested to hear this jeff
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:48.960]   Because you have a one plus this is the five the six plus is almost identical in size
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:55.520]   Yeah, boy is that and it's much thinner and then uh, we call this the iberk six and the iberk six plus
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.720]   I thought that half the services could have made cardboard iPhones. I know
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:00.080]   I know
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:04.240]   I suppose that people do this. You know why because you're trying to decide should I get the little one?
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:07.440]   Should I get the biggest little one compared to the present iPhone?
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:10.560]   Oh, god. It's a bet it's not much bigger
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.600]   It's actually thinner. They've got they made it thinner. Do you have an iPhone for us?
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:20.800]   Oh, actually john's bringing me one. That's cool. That's an iPhone five. All right, same size
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:25.200]   So, it's a lot bigger. So oh, that's a lot bigger. Yeah, that's the five
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:28.800]   Then on top of that's the six and then top of the below that
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:35.040]   Is basically the six is like next is five sized. Yeah, and the and the six plus is um
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:38.080]   One plus sized. Yeah. Yeah
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:41.120]   Yeah, because this is the yeah, there's the six on top of the one plus
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:44.080]   It's almost identical in size to the one plus
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:48.560]   That's that's actually encouraging because I really like this and it's got a better camera
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:51.280]   It's got uh optical image stabilization
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:55.440]   So I think this would make a great, you know way to shoot movies 4k movies
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.880]   As you're holding that like that. I they're they had two nice things they're not going to be stage relation and they had um
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:08.480]   Uh autofocus at the chip level. Yeah phase detection autofocus built into the sensor
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:11.680]   That's the oh, it's for it to my knowledge the only phone that does that
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:16.000]   So those those are both very cool and
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:23.440]   That that combined with it actually having a 1080p screen should mean that you can do very nice stuff and also they say 240 fps
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:29.680]   Uh, sloma super slo-mo. Yeah, it's 720p, but still that's still very interesting. I'm happy with that too
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.680]   Really nice camera. Yeah
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:34.080]   The uh, you know, it's I have no trouble with the hardware
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:37.760]   I don't know if I can I'm so spoiled by androids and its customizability
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:42.800]   That I don't know if I can go back to that grid of icons. I just don't know if I can live with that
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:45.760]   It's kind of limiting
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:47.760]   Yep
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:51.360]   So kevin, I share your uh conundrum. What do you buy? What?
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:55.360]   Okay, I'm not in your position. I might this phone is only about a month old
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:58.240]   But still I have to have a buy new phone
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.320]   So my uh, I take that one from you, but
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:05.360]   I can get you an invite you want an invite we'll get you an invite will somebody tweet kevin marks and invite
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:11.440]   Oh, that would be nice. Yeah. Yeah, for I'll tell you for okay. If you include the price the price
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:15.840]   This is a great idea. Yeah 350 bucks for this. That's 64
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:20.000]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.520]   So my actually my tip is something for anybody is the three of you who have one plus one phones
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.440]   Um, this is actually a really nice case. I don't know if you even noticed I have a case on it
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:35.520]   I'm not crazy about that weird texture on the back there. So it's actually nice. This is a clear case. It's eight bucks
[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:38.560]   Um, it's uh, it's kind of hard soft rubber
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:43.440]   So protected against drops. It's from ring key ring k e
[01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:45.840]   They call it their fusion case fits beautifully
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:49.520]   Does not get in the way. I'm able to use the chargers the earphones without
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:52.720]   Problems, although you'll you'll have to have earphones that have a little bit of
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:56.160]   A depth to them because it does it's a little thick on the top
[01:59:56.160 --> 01:59:59.760]   But uh, I've been very happy with this and and uh, I don't normally carry cases
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:05.280]   This one's so unobtrusive and invisible that I like it. In fact, I hope they make one for the uh, iPhone 6 plus because this is
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:10.160]   Exactly what I need. It's called the one one plus one case. It's available from
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:16.560]   Amazon for 799 and includes a screen cover which I you know screen protector, which I don't use so
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:19.680]   Because I've been using this one for um
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.960]   The next is five which is tech 21 which is very similar. It's like, yeah, it's farron kind of a clear case
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.040]   But we're in force of the edges. Yeah, yeah
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:28.800]   You know
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:33.600]   You're carrying a big plate of glass in your pocket anything hits the glass you're screwed
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:38.400]   And but if you're lucky enough that it drops on a corner while at this little protected anyway
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:44.080]   Do we lose your audio jeff all I heard was i me
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:51.280]   Oh, oh my god. Oh, hello. Hello. All right. Hello. Hello. You hear me now?
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.120]   Can you hear me now?
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:58.320]   All of a sudden of all people to do a horizon commercial you're the last one I would expect jeff

[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:10.320]   Hey, you know, we never give you a plug for this, but if you want jeff to speak

[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:55.040]   And I take a lot of money
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.720]   I'm not going anywhere. Let you pay me
