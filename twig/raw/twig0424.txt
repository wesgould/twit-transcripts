[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.240]   Very nice. Where's the amazon echo in there? I can't see where it's where it's mounted there
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.800]   Yeah, this one doesn't have one. I'm sure there's a security camera hidden somewhere in here though
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.520]   Oh, let's not think about that. I'm hoping not
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.000]   Uh, but also joining us super awesome guy matt cuts acting administrator for the us digital service
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.880]   And it's been a while since you've been on this week in google. It's great to have you back matt
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.640]   Really good to be back. Thanks for having me. Absolutely. Um
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.760]   I I'm gonna ask you because like leading up to the show. I was like man
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.040]   What is matt doing right now because your your kind of duties at the us digital service have
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.640]   Shifted over the past. I don't know year. Did you start about a year ago at this point and I mean?
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.360]   The year things really change. What are you doing right now?
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.720]   That's uh, yeah, it's a year and three months at this point
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.600]   So whenever I started out I joined a the team of the us digital service that was working at the pentagon
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.960]   And they're doing some really cool stuff about military recruiting and and trying to you know
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.720]   Make those systems work better and then in january I switched to the headquarters
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.280]   Which is part of the executive office of the president and have been the administrator and there's so many great projects happening
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.160]   Like if we get the right engineers product managers designers on board
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.200]   Uh, we've got some really really fantastic stuff to help veterans doctors and patients
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.920]   Uh, just a ton of different people with different, you know, making the federal government work better
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.920]   Which is as important a problem as we can do
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.760]   Nice. That's really cool stuff. Um important work and I I have to imagine we were talking a little bit about this prior to the show
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.480]   Uh, but you know shifting from the bay area where you've worked for so long to go to
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.040]   The other coast essentially go to go to washington dc and live your life there. It's dc's such an awesome city
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.080]   So i'm sure you're having a lot of fun, uh being in a new place and basically you have a new life at this point
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.960]   There's a lot to do there. So it turns out our cats are city cats who knew
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.000]   You know they adjust it to all the sirens immediately
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.200]   So
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   But they just stay indoors anyways and occasionally hopefully at least i'm hoping they crawl onto your shoulders during the show
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.720]   Um
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   Maybe maybe i'm holding out hope for something that won't happen, but hey it makes really great tv
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.160]   So we'll see uh, that's a thing i'm so in I want to see this
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.800]   Well, I know we've had we've had some intrusions by europettes as well stacey and i gotta say it really makes great tv
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.880]   When that happens, yeah, you know it's honest are cute. Yeah, that's true no naked mole rats. I don't want to see any of those
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.360]   Go with all rats. I know we'll just never mind
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.240]   Yeah, i'm not going to tell you what i what i had planned for a little bit later
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.440]   Um
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.960]   All right, so before we kind of get started with you know some of the
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.600]   Really really important news
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.840]   Uh, you may remember go back in time just a week ago. We celebrated google's
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.000]   20 year anniversary of registering the domain google.com
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.360]   This week we celebrate google's 19th birthday and who knows what we'll celebrate next week
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.000]   Uh, but google
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.360]   Yeah, I think that's probably it new pixel devices will be you guys will be celebrating that i won't be on that show
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.200]   But i'll be there in spirit
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.720]   Um, but google is celebrating if you go to google.com
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.880]   They you know their google doodle that change it all the time has a little play button on it it activates a spinner
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.080]   So you can you can spin uh spin for your chance to play one of 19 different
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.960]   Uh doodle games from kind of i think from google's history essentially, right?
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.800]   Yeah
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.680]   Kind of dies back in time. Oh, I got that one too kerson
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.280]   Oh, I remember so so who does like who gets the fun job of like making these games and doing this and do they have another job or is this
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.200]   All they get to do because
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.600]   I every time I see these as they become more
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.240]   As they become fancier i'm like
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.480]   Who's doing that how fun is their job?
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.800]   Yeah, there is a dedicated doodle team at google that works on you know
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.720]   Trying to figure out what would be good doodles and then sometimes they get assists from other parts of the company whenever you've got an engineer
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.760]   Who's like I can code up a version of pac-man for you that fits in a logo. That sort of thing
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.160]   Okay, that's it i'm like that's kind of heartens me that there that's an opportunity for people to have fun
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.440]   Yeah, I know right if that is your task for the days to create these things you've got a pretty awesome job
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:10.480]   Uh, so that you've got pac-man you got tic-tac-toe or thay quizzes this new snake game if snakes your jam
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.920]   You can go there you can play snake all sorts of different things so spin the wheel see if you can play all 19
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.440]   I don't know, you know
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.120]   What happened when they did the pac-man game that some company like figured out just how much productivity
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.160]   Was spent wasted on playing pac-man and how much that actually cost the economy
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:34.560]   Yeah, can I tell you my favorite google logo secret which you can't tell my dad about? Yes
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:41.920]   Was your dad watch this week in google? I guess that's the important. I'm hoping he doesn't watch this episode otherwise i break his heart
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.520]   so
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.240]   There was there was a wonderful engineer on our team who
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:53.520]   We decided to do a just a fun good will thing and and what it was is when we knew it was a person's birthday because they have their birthday
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.120]   Set in their profile it will show a special special birthday logo
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.600]   Um, which I think is a fantastic idea
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.920]   Unfortunately, my dad thinks that like it's only for him
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:11.440]   He doesn't realize that the logo appears for everybody and it kind of is you know for him because like a person on the web spam team
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.280]   Coded that that original incarnation up, but uh, yeah
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.400]   He thinks oh you still have some sway with google because my birthday and and you showed the logo and i'm and i'm like
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.200]   Yeah, dad that's for you
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.000]   Totally for you your special
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.040]   Mm-hmm. What what ever it takes to keep that happy
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.720]   Um, no one no one tell mr. Cuts this that would that would break his heart. I'm like, oh
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.080]   That's true. He's not on twitter, right
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.480]   Uh, he does look for google news stories of me. So please don't write any stories about it
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.720]   So yeah, I should never have asked this question. That was the wrong thing to do Jason
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.320]   That was my mis my my choice. I took responsibility. All right. Well, keep us posted on that
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.000]   I'm sure he'll never find out
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.560]   Uh, because really that's that's what google wants right and wants everybody to feel very special and continue using their products and continue
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.000]   Sharing everything that you possibly can with them
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.320]   Uh for all that gain. Uh, why don't we talk a little bit about this last week?
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.040]   We were kind of
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:21.120]   Hypothesizing about the rumors of HTC and google we had heard at that point that rumors were saying that google might actually buy
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.240]   HTC's mobile phone division outright
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.720]   Uh, it turned out, you know, I think it was the very next day. We found out what actually happened
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:36.000]   HTC struck a deal with google that resulted in google paying HTC 1.1 billion dollars
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.800]   and for that some
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.920]   Google gets 2000 around 2000 HTC employees for its own hardware division
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.840]   Not only that google gets non-exclusive access to HTC's ip library for their devices
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:56.000]   Uh, so not an all-out buyout, which you know, it really I feel like at the end of last week's episode
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.120]   I walked away going that makes a lot of sense. They're totally doing that
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.840]   Uh, no, they're not it's a stripped down deal as far as that's concerned
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.680]   But still gives google, you know, a pretty pretty hardy boost when it comes to their their hardware ambitions
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.240]   And you know, it's possible that they might work on their own
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.000]   uh, soc
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.920]   Uh, possibly integrating further tensor processing units the tpu's into the devices. We know that that's their plan
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.600]   So 2000 employees is nothing to sneeze at. What do you guys what do you think about this? Did this live up to the hype?
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.400]   I guess we'll find out but
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.200]   What do you think matt?
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   Or or stacey actually
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   No, don't go with the matt go
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.440]   Oh, i'll just say at least it's much much cheaper than motorola and then with that off to you stacey
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:51.040]   So, oh, I am having crazy connectivity stuff. Sorry guys here. Um, let me let me see if I can adjust something
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.120]   Um
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.400]   That's how we can hear you. It's a it's a little ramped down. You can hear me. You can still hear you. Yeah, okay fabulous
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.400]   Okay, so I was I thought it was hey, it's cheaper than motorola and it's cheaper than nest
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.640]   And it gets them a lot of credibility in this space and i'm super excited
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.400]   because
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   I want google to have hardware
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:19.200]   That's awesome and user friendly so they can actually start delivering on this promise of truly contextual information
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.680]   From their kind of ai back end
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.600]   So I was really excited about this and i'm kind of sad that the next phone i buy will probably have a lot of this in there
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.080]   That was my take
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.040]   Yeah, i'm curious to know
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.240]   Like obviously with the next pixel devices coming out
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.840]   Uh, we know that htc is involved with one of them lg's involved with the other the smaller
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.960]   Of the two pixel devices the pixel xl2
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.200]   Or no, sorry the pixel 2 and then there's the pixel 2 xl
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   Which is the one that lg's involved with i'm curious to know which one of these two like being that they're produced by different manufacturers
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:04.240]   How similar they actually end up being which makes me think they're probably there's probably going to be some very subtle if not so subtle
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.560]   You know differences between how these devices end up
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.960]   But of those two devices does the one produced by htc end up being the better of the two
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.440]   And you know how does that shape the perspective of this purchase
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.840]   In you know merely a week later after her for a week or two later after it was announced the deal was announced
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.560]   I will say I have the so this was the nexus so from two years ago that was produced by lg
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.040]   And that was the one with the huge flaw that makes it just stop working at a certain point in time
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.840]   So after two of them that have stopped working. I'm like, hey, you know what?
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.160]   You know it would be good for for google for me a phone not made by lg
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.640]   So that's like htc
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.960]   It has good
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.800]   I've always liked it's ui. I would love to see something. I mean do you remember htc sense. That was just great
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   I would love to see that in
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:04.080]   In a pixel look some of that influence there as part of either the phone or even android
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.440]   I don't know. I remember htc sense back in the day
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:14.320]   You know as far as the overlays were concerned. I was actually pretty into htc sense, especially when compared to
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.520]   What what touch whiz was but then over the years, you know, I've at least for me
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.200]   And I think a lot of enthusiasts have grown more and more accustomed to kind of like the stripped down
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.040]   Not quite so heavily influenced on the ui side of things
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.680]   Uh, you know version of android not not quite so much with the overlay
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.480]   Um and even htc on their own phones has kind of stripped things back a little bit and refined it to a better position. I think
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.280]   So I I will give one power tip
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.200]   Which is if you do have an xs 5x still sitting around the house and I've got one and i've been a little
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.240]   Scared to upgrade it because i'm worried, you know, uh
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.720]   That upgraded it might cause it to crash or or brick itself
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:04.000]   But if at least right now if you go to the google store they have pixels for sale and you can trade in your phone and
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.720]   Nexus 5x is one of those that you can trade in
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.720]   I don't know if it'll stick around for whenever the new pixel 2 stuff comes out
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.000]   But i'm like, okay, I can hold on to this Nexus 5x a little while longer and then use it as trade-in fodder
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   So that I can get a little bit of a discount
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.800]   Yeah, and that mine's totally broken so I cannot do that. What happened to your final?
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.960]   How did it break? Did you drop it or is it like?
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.760]   No, no, no, it's the it's the lg flaw. It's it's just
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.080]   It's the second time this happened the first time google actually
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.240]   replaced it
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.200]   But then it happened again. It's okay. I'm like a week away from having hopefully a new phone
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.120]   Well, I mean it's worth worth checking out
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.080]   Um, you know considering it's kind of tied to some sort of a flaw with the hardware
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.600]   I think the trade-in value on the 5x if I remember I'm trying to find it right now and having a hard time
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.360]   But I think the trade-in value was somewhere right around like 80 to 100 bucks
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.000]   So I mean, you know google might work with you and and knock that off considering it's um
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   A flaw of the actual hardware 5x has been known to have its its bugs and its issues
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.880]   Um, no actually the site is saying Nexus 5x up to 165
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.880]   Some trade-in value
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.400]   Nothing is that because these things of the devices are going to be expensive
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.360]   So you get what you can
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:29.120]   Buy the Nexus 5x on eBay for $5 or $10 and then use it as a trade-in
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.560]   Arbitrage yes exactly arbitrage. How can we maximize our savings?
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:42.000]   So much work to get a hundred dollars off, but hey if that's your if that's your intention. There are ways i'm sure
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.040]   Um, and by the way since we're since we're kind of talking about next week's
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.160]   Event if you didn't know we're definitely going to be doing coverage here on
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.640]   On the stream will be doing live coverage. I actually won't be here, but ron Richards
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.840]   I believe with leo l'aport are going to be on set wednesday october 4th starting at 9 a.m pacific
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.840]   12 p.m. eastern
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.160]   Uh before this show next week so you guys are going to have all the stuff to talk about
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.560]   Sure planning to keep you fueled throughout the episode and to get excited about are you um are either of you
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.560]   like interested in the uh the pixel book the kind of
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.720]   rumored next generation of the chrome book pixel that i have here
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.920]   Uh jeff will be yeah, we all know
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:33.360]   I like i know i'm good. Yeah, i've got my chrome book right here. My dad's got a chrome book
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.320]   I've got a chrome book at work just for getting on the guest wi-fi there
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.840]   So october 4th is like my christmas because that's basically what i'll be getting for christmas
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:48.800]   Uh, i'll just take one of everything, you know, we'll see about all the the various accessories, but yeah the the pixel book
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:55.680]   It's been a couple of years. I was worried whether we would have a new a new one or not and you know, I hope it's got a real keyboard not you know
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.960]   some
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.680]   magnetic attachment latch do hickey because
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.440]   Sometimes you want a real keyboard. Yes. No, I completely agree
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.200]   I've been holding out because this is the first generation we talked about this a little bit last week
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.600]   But I mean it's pricey. It's a it's a pricey up, you know next generation
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.160]   You okay with that? Do you find the pixel line to be worth worth the upgraded cost compared to others
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:25.440]   Whenever you make a user story for pixel books and chrome books like there's probably a picture of me right there like, you know
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.800]   Two-factor authentication and security keys and all that sort of stuff. It's right down my alley
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.160]   So needless to say you're all in you're all in yeah
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.920]   also
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:44.000]   Just a little bit more information about the new pixel devices themselves. We have now multiple sources to different
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:52.640]   Publications including android police and also to bgr and a few others that are saying just a few tidbits basically
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:59.120]   Both of the devices are going to have stereo front facing speakers that i'm guessing is to you know at least in some ways
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.960]   Will make up for the fact that there is no headphone jack you're going to need a dongle in order to do that
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.160]   But you get stereo front facing speakers. So yay
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:17.280]   Also software based portrait mode so doing the kind of fate, you know dynamic fading of the background or a blurring of the background
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.240]   Keeping the foreground in in focus kind of similar to dsl our techniques that you can do
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.040]   Um, but this wouldn't be done with a dual camera. I have the note eight right here
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:33.840]   And you can do that sort of thing, but you know it requires the dual camera array on the back in order to do that and the iphone eight
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.760]   Plus does this with dual cameras a lot of them dual dual cameras
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.000]   Apparently this is going to have these pixel devices are going to have single camera and still be able to do this through software
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   We'll see how well that's done. I don't know
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.520]   I'm a little hesitant on that one because I feel like
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.400]   That's a lot computationally. That's a lot to pull off and make it look actually really good
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.560]   but
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   If anyone could do it google I I trust I mean photos is such an amazing product and I am constantly surprised like even their scanning technology
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.280]   Is that's all software and it's like magic. Yeah
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:17.520]   That's true. This is a good point. Uh photos is by by a large one of my favorite all-time
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:24.800]   kind of google apps and services and that's because they do such amazing things with their computational uh stuff on the back end
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.560]   And yeah, so I guess from that perspective
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.200]   Who's to say that they can't pull it off and make it look good?
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:38.400]   Also music recognition from the lock screen. So think shazam style recognition, but that's happening live
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.040]   On your lock screen. So if you happen to be somewhere and you're like hey, I like this song
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.200]   You just look at your lock screen and then you realize it's just a beeper and then you burn your phone
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.920]   Um
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.400]   You're like wait a minute. Did I just say I don't know
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.040]   the world is undoing for me
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:04.560]   So that's either a feature or a bug depending on how you look at it
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.160]   Um
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.440]   Always on display squeezable frame that we kind of knew about
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.320]   And yeah, I'm sure a whole lot more
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.400]   I'm hoping a whole lot more at this point
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:21.280]   We we know so many things or we think we know so many things through the leaks that there's just no surprise left in the world anymore
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.480]   That's it's like looking at your christmas presence before christmas morning. I mean it's terrible
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.560]   It really I used to do that. So I know the feeling of disappointment really well. I'm like, oh, this is so familiar
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.880]   In all honesty, I mean, what would you?
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.760]   What would you like to see I sit there and I think about my phone and i'm like
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.840]   You know, it does pretty much everything I wanted to do and the things I wanted to do
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.720]   Like float in the air after me. So when i'm not wearing pockets, I still have access to it. You know this
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.080]   That's probably not going to be in this issue. So yeah
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.520]   Yeah, it's true. I mean I have I have a hard time sometimes like analyzing how
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.560]   Like I have how I feel about these announcements because I do what I do
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:12.160]   And then I have a hard time analyzing how I would feel if I don't if I wasn't in the position that I am where I review a lot of phones
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.480]   I talk about technology all the time like how would I actually feel I
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.240]   You know, what would I feel like I really need out of another phone if I had
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.080]   Last year's pixel and this next pixel is coming out
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:30.560]   What would it take to kind of move the needle and make me feel like I need to buy this and I think if I was just using it like
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:37.200]   You know, just a regular everyday user. I'd be pretty I'd still be very satisfied with my current pixel. It's a pretty great device
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:43.920]   It is a good device, but I would so give up an extra millimeter or two in order to have more battery life
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.720]   It feels like always so many people are like look the bezels are so thin and all that sort of stuff
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:56.080]   I'm like I just want a phone that will always make it through the day and into karaoke that night because turns out you can do karaoke in d.c
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.320]   But all I'm saying is like, you know
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.760]   You want to be able to make sure that phone can make it through the concert or whatever it's you're going to and
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:09.040]   After a year the battery life always tends to go down a little bit. So whether it's more battery or
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.640]   You know the ability to swap out a battery that that would be pretty nice. I take that over being waterproof
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.880]   How often you go swimming with your phone?
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.440]   Uh, I dropped my phone and in bodies not bodies of water. Well, sometimes bodies of water
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.920]   It
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.920]   It's a hard thing to learn not to put your phone into your front pocket. You know, that's
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.360]   I would have thought I would have learned it by now, but no
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.280]   No, no
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.280]   The problem with that is you have learned it for like 95 percent of the time
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.680]   But it's that one time that that you lapse
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   That is the time that it that it goes for a dunk goes for a swim
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.800]   Definitely been there. Um, yeah, I'm happy to hear that these are probably going to be
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.440]   uh water and dust
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.040]   Protected have a better ip rating in that regard, but um, yeah, I don't know
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   I've been pretty satisfied with my pixel
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.520]   But of course I will you know be eager to see what they have and probably get it because hey
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.360]   We talk about this stuff all the time in the network. It's kind of what we do here
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.720]   Um, hey, what did you think about the jacard news?
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   Project jacard, which is google's I guess it was two I can't remember if it was two or three years ago at google i.o
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:25.840]   Google showed off with its a tap division, um, which is kind of its experimental technology division
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.160]   Project jacard, which is essentially fabric that has conductive
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:36.880]   Electronics ins interwoven into the fabric so you can do things like make the sleeve
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.520]   Which is the case with the levi jacket here make the sleeve touch sensitive
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:48.480]   So it can connect to I and sync with your phone so that in this case while you're riding your bicycle around New York city
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.000]   Instead of having to like look at your phone to switch songs
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.840]   You just brush your sleeve and it switches to the next track
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.200]   Well, now we're finally seeing the the fruits of all of that effort
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:06.160]   With a 350 dollar jacket called levi's commuter trucker jacket the non-tech version costs 148
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:10.560]   This is the one that has project jacard interwoven into the sleeves
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:17.040]   And uh, I got to ask you guys 350 worth it. Is this a jacket that you would buy? What do you think?
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:29.200]   No, but you know what I would buy and in here's
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:36.320]   I would buy actually jacard probably not interwoven into my couch because my couch is going to last for you know
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.600]   Hopefully like 10 years maybe longer and I'm a little doubtful of the technology
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:48.320]   But like a little flap that I could stick on my couch like a little couch doily that has this capability that might be kind of fun
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.880]   um, but
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.840]   in a jacket that kind of cost for
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:59.680]   No, no, I'm much more excited about actually apples air pod plus
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.040]   It's watch for something like that where I can just ask serrated to do something for me
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.400]   Or you know get google so I can just talk to it while i'm biking that that feels much more reasonable
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.040]   I like the idea of a google doily
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.640]   Um, google doily go on that go on the record with that
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.680]   Uh, well and
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.520]   It's also the case that like
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:25.840]   For 350 dollars you're locked into one look and maybe you really enjoy springsteen or maybe that really fits with you know
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.200]   Your personal fashion statement, but if I had a google doily then I could you know or I or google
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.120]   You know just a piece of fabric you could wear like when you're running or headband or something
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.480]   Then you could you know, you could have it be modular. Uh, right?
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.520]   Gekard sweatbands. Oh my gosh you guys
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.240]   That's what we need like this
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.560]   Oh sweat i was thinking headband
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:54.400]   Yeah, that would work too actually man. There's a whole lineup here
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.640]   Do do we think that uh the potential of jikard will take it that far?
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:04.320]   I mean this is this is the first product it took a long time now mind you they they say they waited until this fall
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:10.640]   They probably could have it released it sooner, but the the fashion industry works on a different timetable, right?
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.880]   This is a jacket that's perfect for the fall
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:19.920]   Seasons that they kind of had to wait until now to release it and it definitely has a very specific target audience
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.560]   You know of a bicyclist essentially
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.600]   Um, but I mean do we see jikard
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.720]   Going in in large numbers to other
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:34.960]   Types of wearables or is this one of those projects one of those google projects that it's neat that they did it
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.080]   It's neat that they tried it, but probably not gonna see much more of it
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:43.520]   I so I don't know if you saw this story. I think it was on the rundown about it
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:51.120]   You can't wash it more than 10 times. Yes, so that feels like maybe actual clothing isn't the right
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.240]   Venue, although, you know, I don't know if I've washed my jackets 10 times. Yeah, that's my question. Yeah
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:03.280]   So fair, but if there's a durability question about it, it's very expensive to pay for
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:09.120]   What is what 35 bucks between between washing? Um, so
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.480]   Again, clothes may not be the right form factor. I don't think doilies probably are either but
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.960]   Trying to figure out some sort of transitional a place to put
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:25.360]   Fabric connectivity and fabric is actually a really cool idea and I I think it'd be interesting in like cars
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.240]   Like the upholstery and cars maybe
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:33.120]   Armrests and furniture again. I don't know
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.840]   Yeah, it's like
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.360]   I mean as far as like embedding it into things that aren't closed it would have to be embedded into something
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   Like the car actually makes a whole lot of sense because you're only ever really sitting in that driver's seat
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.640]   Like there's always someone sitting in the driver's seat. So having a panel
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.920]   You know that that is responsive in that way
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.640]   Like it's always going to get used because there's no other way to do it like a couch or a sofa
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.760]   Sofa actually prime example of you had connectivity built into the armrest of a sofa
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.960]   That only works if you're sitting on that side of the sofa if you're on the other side
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.320]   It's way more inconvenient for you to have to get up and go over there and do the thing
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   Wait, who says you can't build it on both arms? Come on. I suppose so
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.240]   Weaving technology into fabric here. Come on. That's true. That's a good point. What do you think that?
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.440]   Well, and there's a there's a $50 kit called makey makey
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:28.480]   That lets you hook up, you know two alligator clips to almost anything like bananas
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.640]   And then you can use that as a sensor input
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.320]   So I feel like if you could make the fabric be you know compatible with a system like that
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.000]   You know, so it's like a little label like scotch guard except it's you know controllable fabric or something like that
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.080]   Then yeah, you got it on both sides of the couch. You could have it in the upholstery on the car
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.600]   It just doesn't feel like you got to lock it into one platform of a particular
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.320]   item of clothing so
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.040]   Yeah, for me it feels very neat that you're able to do this
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.840]   I just don't know how essential it is, but maybe i'm not
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:07.600]   Maybe i'm not the right person to think about like you know the future of technology in that regard, right?
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.160]   Like when I think about it embedded into a couch
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.120]   I'm like, well, what do I need that for? I just use I either use my voice
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:18.800]   Or you know voice is actually very convenient now that I have my google home in the living room
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.000]   I really need to turn off the lights or turn on the tv I can do it with my voice
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.640]   Do I choose to no because I always have that remote there that does everything that I needed to do and that just is fine
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.440]   But maybe this could eliminate your remote. It's not later lens. Yeah, that's right. That's right
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.400]   So for the people who lose their remotes all the time
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.040]   Perfect. It's now your couch
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:46.800]   Your couch is now your remote. Yes, exactly the biggest remote you have in your home is your couch
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.600]   Uh, let's hope you don't replace your couch very often
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.680]   And also, you know washing your couch how many washes until
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:02.800]   It stops or how many times you're gonna have to update the firmware on your couch or you know, oh my
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.120]   Yeah, my couch has malware. So actually what this means though is that in the future
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:15.680]   We will have to plug our couches into the wall socket. Yes. This is the thing we are not used to yet
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:22.960]   But a couch we need a wall socket to plug it into otherwise that technology is not going to work needs to be powered somehow
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.880]   Yeah, yeah, and it wouldn't be uh energy harvesting like there's no kinetic energy on your couch
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:38.080]   And then the next generation, you know, they'll have all these features built into the couch and so you'll have your kids
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.160]   Someone who will have you rebooted your couch
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.560]   Control alt delete on your couch
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.920]   It's a pain. It's a pain and I don't like the future at all
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.640]   Future sounds like a video
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.520]   We're back to doilies. All right. That's really what it boils down to grandma's grandma's google doily. All right
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.680]   I like that. I think that's a good direction
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.880]   Um, real quick here one thing that we didn't touch on that
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.720]   Um, I doubt this is gonna appear next next week, but this is new
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.440]   Uh new information that we have about
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:13.520]   Google's plans to work with google home and kind of spruce it up with a larger premium model
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.840]   They apparently they're working on a version that has stereo speakers
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.080]   I don't know how you do that in that small form factor. Maybe it's not a small form factor
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.800]   Maybe it's like a boom box. That would actually be kind of cool
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.720]   Uh, the google home max is apparently the internal name for it
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.840]   That's tentative at this place at this point. It would be to challenge the sonos play three system
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.920]   Would be using premium materials premium build quality
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.840]   and uh
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.840]   Yeah, I mean, I guess this makes sense and we'll talk about amazon's
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.280]   Big stream of announcements that kind of ties into what google is probably doing as well
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.720]   It seems like they're both kind of building out their portfolio around
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.000]   around this type of hardware, but uh, do you think a stereo google home is is necessary?
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.720]   Maybe it's maybe it's not as much stereo as it is high-five version of google home
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.160]   Uh, either of you want that to use it in that way
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.160]   I'm a skeptic
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.680]   I'm like
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.720]   I've had this argument with friends who have sonos and they've spent like
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.160]   Thousands of dollars on their sonos and they're like I can walk from room to room and the audio is seamless
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.120]   And i'm like, you know what else walks from room to room with you
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.080]   Is your phone and it's really not that hard to like place the audio on your phone
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.720]   Maybe it'll have stereo speakers on the front and then you can get good audio that way
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.960]   And it's just you know, it's always with you
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.000]   It's always easy to have your music with you as opposed to weird bluetooth connectivity and all that sort of stuff
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.040]   So so
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.440]   I don't know I I tend to be a fan of like i'll just have one device and carry it with me rather than like
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.480]   Blanketing my home and speakers, but that's just wait
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:56.000]   So you listen to actual real music on your phone and you just walk around with it and you put the phone down and you listen to the music coming from it
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.480]   Yeah, i'm also a barbarian like I you know eat out of the can and
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.360]   No, no, don't listen to me
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:09.120]   No, i'm like i'm just i'm just making sure I understood this i'm like so you just okay. That's the way this happens. Yeah
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.640]   There's zero configuration. You have one device
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:18.800]   It just goes and that's why i'm so incredibly annoyed that they're like, oh by the way, you don't need a headphone jack on your phone
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.720]   I'm like that is literally the only jack i need on my phone is the headphone jack
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.480]   Like, oh, it's got to be thinner i'm like, no, it doesn't need to be thinner it needs more battery life
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.840]   Sorry, okay. I'm into rant. Oh, so you listen on a headset
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.720]   Uh, I do both I do both okay. Um
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:40.320]   Okay, so that is that is i'm gonna say it right here you're kind of weird i mean
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.400]   I have no problem
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:50.640]   Audio experience. I mean, I I would personally opt for yeah better speakers
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:56.320]   Allowing it to play in in rooms, but I also see the other side of this at least with my kids
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.440]   We have a nexus 5x that I have repurposed i've i've set it up with family links
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:07.120]   So it all it can do the only thing it can do is it can run google music on it
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.720]   And that's because my kids if they get ahold of the screen
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.520]   They will never leave it, but I want them to have the ability to always play music anytime
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:22.160]   And so it's like well, how do I get rid of all the other screen things but still let them do what is today's you know equivalent to a boombox
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.840]   Which is you know have all your music and in the clouds streaming on a service?
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.960]   So I give them that and uh and that tends to work
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.560]   But they know how to connect it to the speakers throughout the the house
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.160]   They know how to do this yet
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:39.120]   They always choose to just play it from the the phone and the phone goes with them everywhere and that's just good enough
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.240]   So I see both sides of this I would not choose to do that
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.160]   But it's certainly convenient mp3 is one out right?
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.240]   Convenient yeah, mp3 are like six kilobits. It's fine, you know
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.040]   So, okay, I I on the other hand in super stoked
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.240]   I'm
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.080]   I'm mad. I you kind of lost credibility on the audio question. I feel
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.360]   Like oh
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.040]   Okay
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.480]   So there's there's a couple things here one is this feels like okay. Yes competing with home pod
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.480]   But also on october 4th
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.760]   Sonos is going to make a big product announcement as well
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.560]   Presumably new
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.440]   Hardware new speakers, but also the ability to work with amazon echo so
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.080]   Keeping that in mind too
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.200]   And then yes, we just got all the echo stuff that we'll talk about later
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.840]   Uh, this feels like it's necessary. I mean the google home isn't
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.600]   And
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.760]   It's not terrible, but it's not great. It's not the only speaker I would ever need so
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.200]   Yeah, I I guess I buy it. I don't really use my home very much though. So I'm kind of
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.920]   I don't know I use I use the echo far more than I use the home
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.400]   Yeah, and I I do not have an echo so I don't know the point of comparison
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.600]   But I do know that probably 80% of what I use our google homes for is playing music
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.160]   You know because it's just easy to just fire it off before I got the google home
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.960]   I've been telling myself for years because I'm a big music fan
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.600]   But I had fallen out of the habit of listening to music
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.000]   I had just gotten really used to you know, we do podcasts so I started listening to podcasts and I started having
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.480]   Podcast guilt because all the music that I spent my childhood and you know
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.800]   A younger year's listening to like I just stopped listening to it
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.040]   Then we got a google home and now I listen to music all the time
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.440]   So it's it's become one of the main reasons
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.320]   So I would totally get one of these if it makes it sound better sure
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.400]   Although the current one is totally fine too. Maybe it's not the best sound in the world
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.160]   But it's good enough for what I need it's better than playing it through my phone
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.080]   I'm sorry
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:47.440]   I'm gonna call it now. This is the new minimalism trend where people are like
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:53.760]   I just spent four hours of my weekend configuring my sonos or whatever, but the bluetooth still doesn't work
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.760]   And I can't get this after work
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.600]   Okay, stop stop right there. That's a beauty of sonos. It takes like 10 minutes
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.840]   I have six sonos's I I am one of those people who spent lots of money
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.280]   And
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.640]   I wait, you know what I would love though
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:11.120]   What if like on sonos google and sonos teamed up and they were like by the way
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.040]   Just tell google assistant to play you know
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:17.120]   Beyonce on your sonos living room sonos and that happened because that would be
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.440]   Freaking amazing. Is there no integration between google home and sonos right now?
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.120]   I I don't know because there's there's no integration between sonos and anyone
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.760]   Basically no official integration
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:34.960]   I'm kind of done with like, you know, this company has this territorial, you know choice towards this other company and so
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.280]   Just do it on your phone man. It's always it always works on your phone
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:47.200]   It just works just work. I never I never have my phone. This is this is a girl problem
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.000]   But it's it's a real one. It's a legit problem. I don't have pockets and everything so the phone
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:59.120]   Sometimes it's not next to me. Yeah, okay. That's fair. Sometimes I do that on my purpose
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:06.720]   Fridge and leave because you know what that way I could live my life without being notified to death
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:12.640]   Uh, but that's just me, you know, it's right back to the the minimalism thing that you're talking about Matt
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.760]   Sometimes you just need to step away and simplify a little bit
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.360]   Uh, let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor of this episode
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:23.440]   And then we'll get back to talking more about google and also amazon's big announcements
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.920]   We keep mentioning that so we should probably get to that at some point
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:34.080]   But first let's take a minute to thank casper the sponsor of this episode casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:38.640]   For a fraction of the cost we have two caspers in our house and a third mattress
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.240]   That is not a casper and it is on our list to replace that with a casper
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.960]   That's how good it is because anytime we end up having to lay down on that other mattress for just like man
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.600]   This is uncomfortable. This is not the same casper is revolutionizing the mattress industry
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:58.720]   By cutting the cost of dealing with resailors and showrooms and then passing the savings directly to the consumer you
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:06.160]   Casper's mattress is an obsessively engineered mattress at a fair price casper is made of supportive memory foams
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.240]   Uh for a sleep surface with just the right sink just the right bounce
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.120]   It's exactly what you want plus its breathable design sleeps cool to help you regulate your temperature
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.400]   Throughout the night and I can attest to that part especially
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:24.800]   Uh, it does really well in that regard a casper mattress provides long lasting comfort and support
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:30.320]   And you can buy it easily online like you're used to buying so many other things completely risk free
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.120]   Uh, we've you know, we've had our casper mattress now for like I think a couple of years
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:40.160]   We've had it in our master and we also got one in our in our girls bedroom. One of our girls bedroom
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.440]   Uh, we all love it super soft. It's comfortable casper
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.520]   Really understands and this is pretty important how important it is
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:54.560]   For truly testing truly trying out that mattress in a reality sort of setting like in your home
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.320]   You're going to spend a third of your life on a mattress so it better be comfortable
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:03.280]   So casper offers free delivery and painless returns within a hundred day period
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.560]   So you don't have to lie down in a showroom and make that split decision
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.440]   Which is what we did on the first mattress that we now hate
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:16.640]   Uh, and did you know statistically lying on a bed in a showroom has no correlation to whether it is the right bed for you
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:21.040]   It's really hard to make that determination. You'll really get that by sleeping on it
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.760]   Uh, you know day in day out and then you really understand why it's so great
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:33.280]   Casper recently introduced the casper wave mattress which features a natural geometry support system and a new top layer
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:39.520]   Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards and are made in the usa

[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.200]   Right, i'm sure we've got hey, well, let's let's just jump over to amazon
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.160]   We keep talking about it this way. We don't have to dance around it anymore
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.120]   Um, I feel like I feel like this was a very surprise announcement on amazon's part
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.760]   I had no idea that there was an event. Maybe I was just out of the loop, but then suddenly
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.600]   Boom boom boom it was like five million products were being announced
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.800]   And uh, we've got them all here while we don't have them in studio
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.760]   But we've got them to talk about amazon showed off first a new smaller echo device
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.920]   Um, it's wrapped in cloth. It's not quite half the size
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:58.560]   But it's it's probably like I don't know it probably cuts off a third a third of the size of the original echo
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.720]   But it's wrapped in cloth. So maybe it fits into your home a little bit better
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.760]   Uh, $99 you could get a three pack
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.960]   If you like buying in packs for $250
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.440]   Uh, you just add three to the cart and then you get a 50 50 discount applied there
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:20.160]   and uh, apparently this well with a three pack obviously it offers the echoes new multi-room
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.680]   Functionality so you can get these between rooms like we're just talking about
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.320]   Uh, matt will not do that
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.640]   Uh, many others will
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:34.160]   Uh, and then you can also make free calls in the us, canada and mexico as well as 9-1-1 calls
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.400]   I'm assuming this because you can plug the phone into this which that's what you can do with another device
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.320]   They announced which we'll talk about in a second, but
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:45.520]   smaller echo $99 so lowering the uh, the entry point for
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.200]   Kind of what used to be premium echo functionality
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:54.080]   Um, which thanks stacey. I know that you are an echo user. What do you think about this?
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.960]   Man, I'm super excited now. So I I looked at this and I was
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.480]   I was kind of bummed that I do not have like the wood grained
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.080]   Faux wood grained echo. I'm like, oh, that's kind of neat. Um, I have
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.640]   See in my house, I've got two dots and two
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:17.600]   Two normal sized echoes and so I really I'm running out of rooms. I could buy one more and put it in
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.000]   I've got yeah, I've got one more room. I could use it in so
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.360]   It I probably would buy it, but I may actually go for there's two other products that I'm really excited about so
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.920]   Okay, the plus
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.840]   Let's talk about the plus. All right. All right. Well, the plus is it's kind of hard to call
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.800]   I mean, well, okay
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   So the plus is the more premium of the devices that they showed off today
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.440]   Although it's still cheaper than the current echo or the like the original echo
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.800]   It's $149 which is $30 cheaper than the original echo
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:53.280]   But the echo plus retains the big bigger form factor of the original
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:59.360]   They've kind of redesigned a little bit of the material and everything to make it look a little sleeker and everything a little bit more refined
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.920]   Um, it uh, it has a built-in smart home hub
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.400]   For smart home control. It also includes higher-end sound
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.120]   And components for those who play their music through an echo and not on their phone
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:18.400]   Uh, it ships with sorry bad. I can't help it. It's all good. It's all good
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.960]   Ships with I'm proud. Yes wear it like a badge of honor
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.200]   It ships with a hue light bulb in the box, which I think is there to kind of prove that
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.040]   This is meant to control to be a hub for your smart home
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.960]   Um, stacey, do you know what what is the standard that's built into here because I mean I have hue at home
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.840]   And it requires a new light bulb hub the hue uses zigby
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.280]   But it uses it uses I think zigby ha
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.120]   So zigby's kind of a pain because there were many variations on this standard
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.880]   Uh software profiles so things could get kind of wacky between things
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.520]   But the fact that there is no hub
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:03.440]   They're basically saying that hey, the hue guys are like, yeah, this thing talks zigby
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.600]   And we're gonna just talk to it and you don't need a hub
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.280]   As someone who has I kid you not 10 different hubs
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.440]   I can see if I bought one of these I could get rid of like
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.080]   Six of them which totally worthwhile because my little server closet is
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.720]   It's the hub home
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.680]   And I would I would love this and you know, everybody who
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.760]   Who listens to my show would be excited too because I give away my hubs when i'm done with them
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.280]   So they'd be like, yeah, I get a wing hub. I get a smart things you get a phillips hue
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.440]   So basically this hub is going to replace multiple other hubs
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.000]   Uh that's that's a thought yes
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.200]   I that that would be my hope I would lose the software functionality so like
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:50.720]   In this this is something to think about like if I had this and I had the phillips hue bulb
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.360]   Would I use the phillips hue app or would I just run it through the amazon echo
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:00.720]   Right and that's a real question for people who are partnering too because phillips hue wants my email address
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.560]   It wants all this data and information for itself, but if it's going through the amazon echo
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.280]   How does it feel about that? I don't know
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:13.360]   Um, yeah, the same thing in a hue bulb in the in the package so they're well. Yeah, so that it that
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:18.000]   Are they I mean? Well, did amazon actually because you know amazon doesn't always
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:23.120]   Ask about this stuff. It's like hey, we had some we had some hue bulbs and inventory list toss these in
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.680]   That's true. That's true
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:31.440]   Sweetened the deal. I assume that's not what happened, but you know, I would not put it past chip basis. Yeah
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:38.880]   Uh, what do you think matt you you have google home? I'm assuming throughout throughout your home, but what do you think?
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.040]   I do have a google home. I also have the amazon equivalent
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:48.080]   Uh, I am I am breaking new pioneering waves in dumb home technology
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:54.720]   So, you know, just the just the amount of work to try to control a lot of this stuff. I'm like, you know what?
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.400]   I'll just get up and turn off the light switch myself, you know, so
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.680]   Uh, I'm like adding a skill to this and then you got a reboot now
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.520]   So i'm i'm just uh, i'm playing around with going super super dumb
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.880]   And and just you know trying to use those cycles for other things these days. So we'll see whether that works out
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.880]   I'll report back on the experiment
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.880]   um, but I got to say like
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:22.240]   There's so many devices that amazon announced today. It's like they've just decided to make echo
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:30.000]   Its own like consumer brand, you know, like uh, the echo buttons sound pretty cool, but it doesn't sound like they have anything to do with sound
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.680]   So the echo buttons. This is this is kind of a strange one
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.280]   Um, if you were ever hoping to turn your echo into a game show
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.920]   We've all been there
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.920]   Uh, now you can
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.320]   These buttons are for interacting with echo
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:50.400]   Devices for family. Well, not just family games but for games trivia was one example that they used
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.800]   So so basically you get a two pack for $20
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.760]   And that'll be that'll release timed with the holidays
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.080]   But it's it's kind of like that. What was it staples had their big like
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.040]   Easy button or whatever it's kind of like that
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.920]   But it works with the echo devices
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.240]   So that you can kind of ring in it has a little led light that lights it up
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:18.320]   I know that that that wouldn't came out of nowhere, but I I mean I can understand like that would probably actually be very fun
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:25.040]   It's the first in amazon's alexa gadgets lineup. So there will be more in this gadgets category
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:30.560]   I think this is awesome and i'll tell you why i'll tell you why yeah tell us why
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.160]   So
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   I love gameplay my daughter and I actually we did the jeopardy skill we also do would you rather because she's a tween girl
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.160]   And that's like the best game for tween girls
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.080]   Um, so I can see us having a total fun
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:51.760]   It's like totally a stocking stuffer kind of idea, right? It's $20 for a two pack or two. Yeah, no $20 for two
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:57.840]   That's that's nothing. The other thing is if you're a clever developer, you could start building this into
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:04.000]   Skills so you know amazon's got their iot button, but that's 20 bucks and you have to be pretty adept
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.720]   to code like a skill for your iot button, but like
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.480]   I I spent forever doing a skill for did I feed the dog?
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.920]   So in our house, you know, who knows who feeds the dog, you know, we just it's just a common question
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:25.120]   So we actually put a motion sensor on the dog food
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:30.240]   Container so when we lifted it, you know, it would send a text everybody
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:35.520]   But I wanted to do an echo skill for the longest time to be like this. No, did we feed the dog?
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.880]   And she would tell you yes or no with this button. I could stick it right next to the dog food
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.080]   Whoever opens and feeds the dog they just hit the button
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:49.440]   And then when we ask that question to the echo not each other
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.600]   We'll get an answer
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:58.320]   So I feel like there's a lot of really cool opportunities for being able to press a button to indicate to your personal assistant that lives
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.800]   In your house that something's happened, right?
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:08.640]   Absolutely, and then I mean technically, you know, even this button has an led and it may be a changes to a different color
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:13.120]   When you do that and that way if you don't ask me just happen to be standing there you see there's blue you go
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:20.560]   Okay already done. I know see even even smarter look at you. Well, you know, I am a developer
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:26.240]   Not at all are the dishes are they clean? Yes, right
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:33.040]   Yeah, okay, so then but that that turns this uh like amazon really build this is being
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:40.320]   For games, but I mean really maybe the game part is just an example of some of the unique ways that you can use this and
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.280]   Let developers run wild with it and see what they come up with
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.320]   I like that
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.600]   Um, let's see here. What else do we have we have the echo spot?
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.320]   Which is an alarm clock
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:51:00.080]   Uh with amazon's voice assistant baked baked in as all of these things have a 2.5 inch circular screen does that device
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:06.160]   Um, it has the ability. You know, so it's got a full screen there. You can view cameras
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.720]   Hold video calls of course
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:15.840]   Uh watch video news. I'm sure you can watch videos on there if you really wanted to although the circular screen might make that weird
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.160]   But it has the ability to control your smart home
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.520]   Bluetooth capability 3.5 millimeter stereo cable if you want to take your audio out
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:31.840]   Into your whole you know into your bedroom. Let's say i have speakers and and it's set up there so that you wake up to nice pleasing music
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.920]   Maybe katie perry or somewhere
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:38.560]   Uh $129 ships in december pre-order now
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.160]   Was this the other device that you were really excited about stacy
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.920]   So
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.600]   I was excited about this and then I learned about the the camera feature
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:54.480]   And then I was like, oh if I could do a video call on this that means there's a camera and that means I don't want to put it next to my bed
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.880]   Right, I mean I I do actually trust amazon quite a bit, but I don't trust anybody that much unless there's like a hard shutter for it
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.880]   Um
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.920]   But it's so cute. Yeah, I mean it is cool
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:11.600]   I mean, yeah, maybe maybe you get that and you throw a little little the tape over the the camera and then
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.920]   You know if you really need to use it, but then then you eliminate the cool cute design. I mean, it's
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.160]   So someone
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.320]   Someone called it chubby for it's amazon's chubby and it is it's
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   Yeah, it's exactly that. So i'm like welcome back chubby
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.520]   We missed you
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:35.360]   Um, the button is my favorite thing the little led game buttons. Okay
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.680]   Awesome and not to mention inexpensive so you can get a ton of those
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:46.640]   Um, yeah, and everything that I've read about the spot is that it's considered like a discounted amazon show
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.360]   So if you had reservations about amazon show with the camera and everything
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:56.320]   I mean coupled with the the alarm clock that means it's almost destined to end up in your bedroom
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:02.000]   So, you know ask yourself whether you're okay with the fact that there's an internet connected camera hanging out in your bedroom
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.800]   And if you're okay without the great go for it if not, you know, maybe maybe think twice
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.360]   Hmm. Huh. Yeah, I know you put it that way. I wonder could you use it like a baby monitor?
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.920]   I'm sure I mean again there
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.280]   I'm just thinking could you so you would drop in on it
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:24.720]   But it wouldn't be always I'm just thinking through this. No, you shouldn't use it as a baby monitor. Never mind
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.480]   I
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:31.760]   I mean, you know people uh that that is one of the use cases that they touted is that you can check in on you know
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:37.040]   Like a camera in baby's room to see how baby is doing. So I suppose it's one way to do it
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.880]   Um, it's just you know, you have to ask yourself the the standard questions about
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:47.200]   A video camera that's always connected to the internet and how safe are is our iot stuff anyways?
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.640]   Do we really know we think we know yes, it's not safe
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:56.800]   We know it's not safe. Yes, Stacy Stacy on iot would know the answer to that question
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.800]   Very comfortable telling you that you probably should avoid it. All right. There we go. Uh, there's your advice
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:09.280]   The echo connect is a standalone box that that plugs into a standard phone jack
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:17.520]   What is that first of all? Uh, anyways, uh, and then also into an echo device of your choosing to bring
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.920]   telephone calls to the echo speaker
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.480]   So we talked a little bit about how
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:28.640]   the uh, the new smaller echo and i'm assuming the echo plus have the ability to do phone calls
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.720]   Uh through there
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:38.560]   This is a box that allows your other maybe your outdated your older echo device to also manage phone calls and being that it's coming from your line
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:42.000]   Your landline directly through the plug you get caller id
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.440]   You get the capability of doing 911 if you need to that's something that google home's phone calling
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.920]   Functionality is not able to do
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:56.640]   Uh, so a little bit better there, but kind of a little clunky also because you're plugging it into the wall
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.280]   I don't know people still do that
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.280]   Uh
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:07.600]   I don't I don't I don't even have a phone jack in my house. So when we built our house in 2812. We did not put
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:12.400]   Any copper so like you're not getting one of these then
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.600]   What were you saying?
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.200]   I was just gonna say like I I recently filled out a form and they're like yeah
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.520]   Just fax this back to this number and i'm like look I may be old school
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:28.800]   But i'm not an actual caveman like where are we gonna have a backsline with a landline where we can come on?
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.440]   You can scan that and email that to you. Yeah same difference, right?
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:38.240]   It's I mean it's literally the same thing except it's coming to you through your email and not through a phone line
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.800]   Uh, but i'm still scanning it the way I would if I faxed it
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.680]   Because that's how you do it now
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:49.440]   DC still has faxed like I remember like two years ago applying for press credentials for a senate hearing and
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.120]   They wanted me to fax something in and I was like huh
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:59.840]   Do you see this pro fax? There's a lot of things that uh technology has not completely
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.680]   uh saturated dc yet let's just put it like that
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.400]   You know if you ever need it if you need a fax land kinkos
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:15.280]   Yeah, or is it is it the FedEx store now? I guess yeah, I think it's FedEx. Yeah. Yeah, I believe I don't know
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.560]   I'm trying to think of the last time I actually set foot in a kinkos or a FedEx store
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:23.360]   It's been a long time probably the last time I needed to send a fax actually. Yeah, that's right. Yeah
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:24.880]   Uh, okay
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.440]   So probably not selling a whole lot of those but Amazon also updated man
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:35.440]   They just keep coming uh the fire tv to include 60 frames per second 4k the previous version had 4k
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.880]   Now it's 60 frames per second, but it also now includes hdr support high dynamic range
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:46.480]   It's a small flat dongle it hangs from the hdmi port behind or aside from your tv
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.400]   and uh
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:52.320]   Yeah, hdr 10 support for hdr not doubly vision
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.120]   Dolby atmos support for audio
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:00.720]   Um, which curiously apple tv 4k which apple announced a couple of weeks ago
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:06.160]   Swaps that it actually supports Dolby vision for hdr and hdr 10 for audio
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:10.240]   So, you know, they're they're just a little bit different, but this was cost I think i'll
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:15.200]   A decent amount less it's 70 pre-order now for october 25th
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.880]   Um, either of you fire tv users. That's that's one set top box that i've never gotten though
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.240]   I've heard really good things about it, but i've never tested it out myself
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.120]   Hmm chromecast and roku. Yeah
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.960]   Yeah chromecast for me. Yeah pretty much the same for me too
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.680]   Which is weird though because now with the fire tv with the echo
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.560]   You can do the cool stuff that you can do with google home and the chromecast which is like
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.120]   play
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.760]   Uh, what's it called big little lies or what's that?
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.120]   I'm terrible. Okay play game of thrones and hbo
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.880]   And it'll it'll do it for you. Um, so
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:58.080]   Those that's that's actually a really cool thing to be able to do if but
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:04.640]   Again, i'm not gonna i don't want to go and buy you know, oh, here's my fire tv because right now
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:09.040]   I've got this in my living room and i just just just get along you guys
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:14.240]   Are we gonna talk about are we gonna let amazon and google collide and talk about uh
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.400]   What is it?
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.800]   Not playing youtube on the echo show sure let's do it right now in fact. I think that's right
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.200]   Are we are we done with all of our amazon announcements?
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:29.760]   I think so they they also have an announcement about bmw bringing bringing uh bringing uh their voice assistant to bmw's in 2018
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:35.120]   But that's really all there is to that mid-year next year. They're gonna have farfield microphones throughout the cab
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.040]   Inside the vehicle and have it integrated into the infotainment system
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.360]   Uh, not as flashy
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.120]   But interesting that all of these things are being embedded and baked into
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:52.560]   The the interior of vehicles i'm wondering what that means long term for the resale value of vehicles like five years from now
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.880]   Will that still be a thing and will it just be like oh really you've got that in there?
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.760]   Yeah, that that like fizzled and died a couple of years ago
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.800]   Uh, let's hope not
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.640]   Hope that doesn't happen
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.200]   built in a track. Yes exactly
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:13.520]   Who knows at some point it'll be outdated how long is that point who knows at this point?
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.760]   But yes, let's talk about the amazon echo show
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:23.040]   Uh, this was not announced on stage obviously, but there's basically a brewing
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.640]   Uh, let's call it a kerfuffle between i'm gonna go a bruja
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:30.080]   Haha, brooh, works as well a bruja kerfuffle
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.560]   Uh the same category
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:39.200]   Uh, i would say but it's youtube and amazon are basically there's something going on because youtube no longer plays on the echo show
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.160]   Echo show of course is the screened echo device
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:47.360]   Uh, it says when you try to do that it says google doesn't support youtube on the device anymore
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:53.520]   Google doesn't support youtube on the device anymore. They don't just say this feature is not supported they call google out
[00:59:53.520 --> 01:00:00.320]   Uh, verge contacted amazon who said google made the change based on what they said was no technical reason
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.720]   And they also said that's very disappointing it hurts their customers both of their customers
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.760]   Google saying that they're not living there they're what how they're implementing youtube on the device
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.960]   Violates the terms of service that they've spelled out for
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.640]   youtube
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:19.840]   So no youtube on your on your echo show and let i don't know if it's available through a browser on the device
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:24.800]   Maybe but i there is an a browser on the echo show. Well then no then no, it's not
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.520]   What do you think stacy?
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.840]   Matt opened his mouth so i was i was gonna let him go he was like
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.760]   The only thing i was gonna say is that it reminds me in 2013 there was a
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:43.200]   A little bit of a bruja ha or kerfuffle however you want to see it about
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.320]   Microsoft wanted to get youtube on windows phone. Yes, and
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:57.840]   And it's a very sort of similar sounding argument where microsoft was like oh they're blocking us and google was saying something along the lines of
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.200]   Your you're scraping us when you're supposed to use this api
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.040]   And so i you know we'll see what happens whether they can come to a common mess up common understanding
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.880]   I mean it's definitely the case as a consumer no matter what device you have you want to be able to
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.240]   You know see all of your shows and watch all of your stuff
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:23.440]   But like if i'm on amazon i would also expect to be able to buy a chrome cast and an apple tv and it sounds like sometimes
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.920]   Amazon even though you can buy almost anything on amazon
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.480]   Doesn't doesn't sell you know some devices from other manufacturers so it's
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:37.840]   I understand why a company will have this sort of reaction on both sides, but as a consumer you just want everything to work together
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.280]   Yeah, so
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.320]   Kevin actually brought this up on our show so if you have apologies if you listen to both twig and our show but
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.720]   We talked about it and he said that it's possible that
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.960]   Google is reacting to amazon not because amazon uses a forked version of android
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.320]   That they are maybe not agreeing or they're maybe not implementing the right licensing terms for
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.360]   playing it on an
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.960]   Not android based device, but so that that was his thought and he brought up the windows thing as well
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.640]   So i haven't had a chance to email google and test that theory, but
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.960]   it's
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.240]   It might i mean it sounds very credible. So i was like okay
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.400]   Well and youtube is a separate part of google slash alphabet and so like there is
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:32.320]   I remember seeing a youtube app for I forget if it was the tivo or the xbox or the xbox one
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:38.800]   But like if if you work at youtube you want as many people as possible to be able to watch youtube so
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.160]   uh
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:44.880]   Hopefully we'll get more details about exactly where the breakdown happened and whether it can be fixed up
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.960]   I hope so because my gosh my daughter and I watch our korgy videos at breakfast time
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.960]   on the amazon show and
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.120]   That is a treasured time and youtube has the best korgy videos
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.880]   That's true. We all know this everybody knows this even the queen of england knows that
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.360]   That was because they even dogs know it even corgis know it
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:13.200]   Um, yeah, that's a really good point. I had not considered that um stacey and by extension also kevin
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.600]   Um that yeah the smart one
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.240]   That the fire tablets
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.600]   Don't have any of google's apps on it because uh, you know, they don't adhere to those things
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.120]   It's a forked version. So therefore if you want to get youtube on there
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.960]   Like I always think of youtube when I think of youtube I think of it as being truly cross platform like google's, you know
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.880]   Strategy is youtube in all the screens and in all the places
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.560]   But I mean it's actually not not true when you look at it that way and amazon's no nothing to sneeze at as far as
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.840]   You know the amount of eyeballs that could potentially hit youtube
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.920]   It's just youtube doesn't end up on those devices if you want to actually install it on there
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.480]   You have to jump through some hoops. You have to be very specific. You're not getting it through the amazon app store
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.000]   So you have to kind of sideload them uh, themself yourself
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.360]   Uh, that could be kind of part of what this is all about
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.960]   And that's just I mean you have to sideload uh amazon's video stuff and amazon's apps
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.120]   Not all of them, but some of them the video playing ones you have to sideload on to an android handset
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.960]   Used to which actually a couple anymore. No a couple of weeks ago. This only happened like two weeks ago
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.360]   Uh, my phone died so I switched
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:27.760]   Amazon uh amazon just released to the play store uh amazon insta video a couple of weeks ago
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:35.040]   You can download it you can't chromecast with it because as we know amazon is not very pro chromecast
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.640]   You know they know
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.560]   Even though it's in the play store you can't chromecast uh, you can't even buy a chromecast on amazon's site
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:47.040]   What I understand so you can't know but you can buy an s thermostat
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.760]   That's what boggles my mind is
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.680]   Like all right. Yeah, yeah, that's weird the strange lines that are drawn in the sand here
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.600]   You cannot buy a google home there either in case you were wondering. Oh
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:04.480]   Well, then is that google is that google saying no? Well, no, probably not
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.080]   Google would love to have their bomb sold in all the places. I would think yeah
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.560]   No, no, I don't know if you can walk into an apple store though or buy a google home or her name was on echo either
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.920]   So like it
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.360]   Yeah, well you you can't buy an apple tv on amazon either
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.560]   So I think it's probably amazon that's saying no chromecast no apple tv for you right right?
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.760]   Um, all right. Hey, let's uh, let's take a break
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.920]   Thank the sponsor of this episode of this week in google and then we'll talk about more stuff

[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.000]   uh
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.760]   You if you've ever gone through the process if you ever gone through the mortgage process
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.320]   You probably already know all too well
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:50.880]   How challenging it can actually be kind of figuring out all the all the pieces of the puzzle pulling all the information in

[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.000]   But it could be better the whole process could be improved and the folks at quick alones

[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:18.160]   And we thank rocket mortgage by quick alones for their support of this week in google
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.160]   Um, let's see here
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:24.080]   Oh real quick before we move out of amazon because we missed this last week
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.400]   And i'm actually stoked that you are both here because we can talk about it a little bit
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.160]   So this is a little bit old news
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.640]   But it's worth talking about because the the intersection between amazon and google on this one is very strong
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:40.480]   Uh financial times reported that amazon has its own smart glasses in the works
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.320]   Uh
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.520]   with oh
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.520]   Here we go again
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.360]   Bone conduction for audio so no in ear design and if i remember correctly the original google glasses
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.440]   Google glass did that
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.080]   Uh, no screen no camera
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:03.840]   So in in many ways it would be addressing some of the critical components of glass that a lot of people that were critical of it
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.000]   Uh, you know were were so because of the camera primarily
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.040]   Uh, it would still tether to your smartphone there
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.520]   Apparently according to this report anyways
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.320]   They're creating something that looks more like normal glasses
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:24.000]   So not something sci-fi and and strange on your face. It would actually look like a regular pair of glasses
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.040]   Uh connected glasses for firing off audio commands wherever you happen to be
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:33.680]   So basically it kind of seems like these are your Alexa glasses. Oops. I said the word
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.640]   Um, these are your amazon's voice assistant glasses
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.520]   Uh because everywhere you happen to be you you want to you know
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.440]   Talk to amazon's voice assistant so you might as well wear these glasses everywhere you go to do that
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:51.440]   So apple did this so much better with air pods if like this is what this is it's like
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.680]   Air pods as a way to get seery in your ear, right?
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.720]   So you can talk to her all day and you can have this without ever pulling out your phone, which is cool, right?
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.320]   um
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:07.840]   This is that with glasses and as someone who wears glasses i'm like, yeah sure okay
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:14.480]   Um, but if you don't wear glasses, it's kind of weird and why wouldn't you just do like air pods or your
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:17.680]   In your head for the ear sets headphones
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.160]   Yeah, yeah
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:26.000]   Ear ear pods or yeah in ear headphones, whatever like there's there's the rumor that google's probably
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.800]   Possibly going to be releasing something along what you're talking about at next week's event
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.680]   And they're all they're all doing the same stuff aren't they?
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.280]   um
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.280]   yeah, I mean do we want a
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.280]   Pair of glasses with a microphone in it snap you know snapchat did their snap
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:47.200]   Let uh their snap glasses again now i'm forgetting what they were even spectacles there we go. Thank you car
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.880]   Uh they did their spectacles and i remember at the time, you know and myself included i was like all right
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.120]   They did it right and realized in retrospect i was just totally pulled into the hype
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.400]   um
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.240]   Because they fire their team who cares their whole spectacles team really it's
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.560]   They don't have it anymore the information reported that like two weeks ago. I missed that
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.280]   Um, well, okay
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.720]   So then that didn't work out so well. I mean do we need to go into smart glasses territory again?
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.720]   Haven't we done this a couple of times?
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.480]   What do you think i just don't understand if you don't have a screen why you need classes?
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.720]   I mean, I'm fine. You don't have a camera, but the screen for a heads-up display seems really
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.040]   Like an opportunity but that they're not taking I don't know matt you
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.760]   Yeah, I you know until there's a useful screen
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.800]   I will probably hold off but I will say like if they had glasses that had a useful screen
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:45.840]   That that's a little bit of the dream right because I mean then you could do some pretty amazing things, but uh
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.600]   I'll be curious to see what this actually turns out to be because it's uh, you know
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.680]   Amazon does a very good job of having a clear purpose like they oh here's a device
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:00.480]   We can plug a phone in and you're able to have a phone line, you know, they they don't just like throw
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.080]   They don't just throw out devices that don't have a purpose
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:10.320]   So I but I don't quite get with the purpose of this device would be so maybe maybe that'll become more clear as we get closer or
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.560]   If they release it I
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.560]   Feel like the echo look didn't have a purpose. I
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.560]   Think is Amazon starts playing with this stuff. They're getting uh
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.720]   Maybe a little further from things that have a useful function. I don't know, but yes still
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:31.600]   I'm with you. Well, yeah, it kind of feels like Amazon right now is is firmly in the let's throw stuff
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.600]   at the wall and see what sticks territory
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.520]   Because I mean, you know to in today's announcements were not insignificant
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:42.720]   But boy where there are a lot of them and you have to imagine with that with that amount of
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.360]   of product announced at one time
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.240]   Some of that's gonna rise at the top and some of it's gonna be like, okay
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.480]   Well, we didn't see a second iteration of that because yeah, just didn't go anywhere
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:58.320]   Um, I mean, I mean hey, it's not like Amazon's hurting so they have the ability to
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.920]   Throw all this stuff at the wall. Why not do it? I just don't see any purpose for having a pair of glasses
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:07.120]   That's just and you know and a voice assistant
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.920]   microphone, which is kind of what it sounds like it is
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.160]   Yeah
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.800]   Today was the first day where it really felt like Amazon was throwing a bunch of different stuff against the wall
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.400]   um
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:23.840]   And like, you know you think about the nexus queue, you know, like you can have a really good idea a really good execution
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.360]   But
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:31.840]   The ability to get to people's mind share, you know, is everybody gonna learn about what the look is versus the this versus the that
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.920]   it's um
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:40.240]   It's a hard or so so and it has to be a magical combination of what it actually offers and how much it actually costs
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:45.600]   Which was the failing of one of the failings of the nexus queue is yeah, nobody's gonna buy it for that price
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.240]   Maybe a great
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.200]   Octopus thing
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.680]   Black octopus thing that did something with your television
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.120]   Yes
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.760]   And that's pretty pretty much the marketing strategy for it was just what you said there
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:03.600]   That's about as obvious as it was at the time. I thought it was more audio. Yeah, well, no
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.720]   So it's uh, no you plug it into your tv
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:12.720]   No, you're right. You're right. It was a team. I uh, however, it was also partially audio because it had
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:22.000]   Strangely it had actual speaker an amplifier inside of it and speaker outputs to drive a pair of speakers
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.160]   Like stay, you know stand up speakers
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.560]   Um, so it would bypass your any amplifier that you're likely to have
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:34.720]   And it would act as your amplifier and be your stereo essentially for just that stuff
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.520]   Which was just play movies play tv, uh, youtube content
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:45.760]   And play music. That's all it could. I wonder I wonder what it's like to be a part of a team
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.640]   where you know
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:53.600]   As soon as it gets announced or pretty shortly after that you're like it was a great idea
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.240]   You worked really hard. It's a beautiful device
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.840]   Sorry this juicero or whatever it is that you've worked on
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.520]   You know, it's just not going to work out
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.880]   And then you've got like well
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.960]   I made a thing and I made a physical artifact in this world and it's really well designed
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:12.960]   It's just the price point isn't right or it doesn't meet what people are looking for or the company just doesn't want to get behind it
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.400]   Uh, that's got to be frustrating. Oh, I can't even imagine
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:21.760]   It all comes back around the chubby doesn't it and we're back
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:27.520]   It's true that you spend all that time the device. I mean I have it in my office
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:33.440]   Because we got it, you know at google.io that year and i'm proud to have it because I remember when it came out
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.840]   It was really a symbol of like google's taking hardware in house
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:42.080]   We did we designed this we did this all in house. This is what we're capable of
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.160]   And it was just you know, there were there were parts of the execution
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.280]   Maybe not necessarily with the hardware itself, but there were other parts where you just kind of scratched your head and wondered
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.360]   Why is this so limited in use and why is it three times more expensive than everything else?
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.480]   And why is there an amplifier in there?
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.640]   Is that why it's three times more expensive than everything else because I didn't need an amplifier
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:08.160]   There were just a lot of questions, but hey, you know now google has a lot happening in hardware
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.160]   So I think the the the
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:16.960]   You know the the roses that come from a situation like that that those people that worked on that can smell
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.680]   Um, that's weird. That's a weird way to put this
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.880]   Is is that it leads to other things right?
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:28.000]   It got google through this awkward beginning stage and got them to where they are now
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:34.400]   Producing a lot of really great hardware that people do we all have an ugly adolescence? I mean really yeah
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:39.120]   It paved the way we couldn't get where we were now without having you know
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:45.440]   These sorts of experiences as those pimples and I was like there's its embraces. It was the the queue
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.640]   I do some braces years. Yes
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.760]   I wanted to bring this up. It's not a google thing, but when I was at cd
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.640]   Was it two weeks ago? I don't I've been all over the place since then but I saw these
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:05.840]   Because you mentioned the BMW thing, but there were these amplifiers and speakers that were built
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:12.480]   They were you put them in your ceiling. They were made by a company called origin acoustics and
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.120]   They had little echo dots. So you would buy the echo dots
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:23.680]   You would pop it into this little speaker amplifier thing you would pop that into your ceiling so you'd have a much better speaker
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.720]   You'd have power for the dot, but then you'd have basically
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.880]   Or however many speakers you had in your room you'd have the mics for the echo
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.960]   So basically it turned your room into like an an echo chamber
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.480]   I
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.640]   Thought that was actually kind of a really neat idea and I loved it like
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.400]   It's a great way to think about using the dot form factor to put
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:52.480]   You know once you start adding context to those rooms then it becomes really powerful to be like hey madam
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.240]   A turn off the lights
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.320]   And if it knew like where you were then poof that would happen in that room
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.600]   I don't know. I just kind of got really excited about that and I was like
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.800]   Why are we going to see something like that from google or even apple for home kit? I don't know
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.440]   Okay, sorry
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:14.560]   That is not an inexpensive upgrade either the amplifier retails for $1,500
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   This is like
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.000]   echo dot super
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.040]   Well, this is this is cedia. So this is basically
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:27.280]   Your alternative there is to buy a fancy speaker to go in your ceiling. Anyway, these are good speakers
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.160]   They're not I got your dot speakers got it
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.680]   Um, so matt you with your phone
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.560]   Probably would not go for this
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:42.400]   I would not but then I would argue my life would be simpler as a result so
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:49.680]   Which would leave me more time to read tech news like the fact that bill gates uses an android phone
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:52.480]   Very nice very nice
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:58.960]   Uh, yeah, I couldn't believe that told fox news sunday that he now uses an android phone
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.040]   He did not mention the model
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:05.280]   Uh, but he says he has quote a lot of microsoft software on it
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.960]   Which i'm not
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.000]   Not surprising, but microsoft's been doing a lot in android
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.960]   There's been doing a lot in general building up their software for
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:18.480]   Uh, what would be competing platforms to its own mobile operating system if that was really
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:21.120]   As much of a thing as maybe it used to be
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.680]   Uh, it's not much anymore
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:28.320]   But yeah, I mean I guess not surprising that if he has one he it would be loaded with microsoft apps
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:36.320]   But I guess you know my my thought on this is microsoft's made it really easy to be an android user and still be all in on microsoft
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:39.600]   Um services and this is one example of that
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:44.560]   It feels like the switchover to satya nadella
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:49.360]   like I understand how microsoft would be attached to the windows platform
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.960]   but
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.840]   Windows phone not doing well might ultimately be a really good thing for microsoft because they're like, okay
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:01.600]   Let's get back to our roots making great software for lots of different devices and lots of different situations
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.080]   And they have that core competency, you know the the hyperlapse app
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:13.360]   There's a ton of really not just you know the normal bread and butter core apps like office or or what have you but um
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:20.400]   Like it for me. It's it's really refreshing to see that this is like another act for microsoft and personally
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.120]   It's one that I really love because it's like, okay
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.720]   Let's get back to competing on the merits rather than like, okay
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.840]   We were able to have this platform and therefore that that started us out on second or third base
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.920]   And uh, and I think if you look at microsoft the last few years, they have done some really incredible stuff. Yeah
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.400]   Yeah, the quality azure is a super awesome platform like
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:48.560]   I know that a ws gets all the credit for lots of things, but there are a lot of businesses on azure
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.920]   There are a lot of really interesting things like their confidential compute effort. I thought that was really cool
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.680]   Um, so you know they're building a very credible
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.080]   Tech company still or they have a credible sec company still
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.240]   Microsoft you can be okay
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:07.680]   The scrappy upstart microsoft's gonna do all right. I think it's the long
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:13.280]   Well, and it's just it's a switch, you know, it's it's a different
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:18.720]   Philosophy compared to how they were for like a lot of the 2010 or
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.480]   Thousands they
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.120]   So yeah, it's it's a big change in their philosophy, but then at the same time like like you point out
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.040]   It's it's also kind of a return to form
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.720]   Uh, they've really focused on their software. They've also built in features that make it really easy to be on
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:41.840]   iOS and android and still kind of live integrated in the microsoft world windows 10 has features that improve that interoperability
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:47.520]   They also, you know allow things like resuming your work on your mobile device from the work that you're doing in your desktop
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:52.720]   And uh stuff like that. So you know in to that degree. It doesn't really matter
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:58.080]   Which mobile OS you're using their services still work between and that's just as good
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.360]   Um
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.160]   Someone pointed out in the chat room. Sorry. It just was by there
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:08.320]   Uh, but that you know just as a reminder mary jofoli windows weekly that's the phone that she uses is an android as well
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:16.160]   She says that microsoft services work well on android. So hey does the trick then it doesn't matter a whole lot
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.400]   But it's nice to know bill beats is on our side
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:22.800]   Nice nice to have you bill
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:27.200]   Good to have you here. Hey, should we talk a little bit about well last week? Um
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.120]   We mentioned that google was considering
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:37.680]   Making some changes to address what the EU had charged, you know 2.4 2 billion
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.120]   um
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:44.160]   Euro antitrust ruling based on how google was treating its search results around
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:50.320]   Shopping and you know compared to competitors that were also appearing in that in that area
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.400]   Uh, so that happened part of that agreement even though google is is
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:02.400]   Is going back and and appealing the ruling part of the agreement is that google needs to make changes to make it fit more fair
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.000]   You know
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.520]   In the interim and beyond and we had talked a little bit about about their potential plan last week. Well that has actually happened
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:18.720]   Um, they're doing what they were planning on so basically they're going to allow competitors to bid for and they're going to be
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.840]   You know reselling ad space up at the top of search results
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.440]   in europe
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:30.320]   Uh on their google home page google is also going to be bidding on those auctions as well against the
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:37.840]   Competitors that are coming into also go for those spaces google apparently has a cap that it's set for itself that it can't pass
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.840]   but
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.720]   You know a lot of the competitors saying well, this is no good now googles, you know just gonna make
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:47.520]   You know make all sorts of money off of this
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.800]   They're gonna have to pay high rates in order to win those auctions because google's in the in the game as well
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.120]   And they know has the money to back it up
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.840]   Uh, they say it's uh, it's operating as a separate business in these auctions
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.480]   Uh to be fair to competitors google says this
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:07.840]   Uh, what do you guys think is this a good kind of way to tackle the the antitrust?
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:12.800]   Issue that the EU has has dropped on google's lap. What do you think?
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:19.040]   So wait, are they so that you're going to be able to bid against google
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:25.680]   Yeah, google's cap then would probably become your floor if google wants that space. That's the challenge
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.200]   Yeah, so okay. I'm just like, let me make sure I have this
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.320]   I know
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.120]   And when you put it in that term then it almost sounds like well wait a minute
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.720]   That's not fair because ultimately google ends up winning right they did they just like in a bit of well
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.840]   I don't know. What do you think that?
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:46.800]   I mean it sounded more like there will be bidding and then there will be a limit above which google might not go
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.360]   And then if people wanted to go above that then they're guaranteed
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:54.240]   But I thought the other article in the rundown was also super interesting because it it's sort of
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.800]   It was in bloomberg. It sort of says
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:02.400]   The remedy that google proposes will be tested by asking google's competitors what they think of it
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:09.200]   and if you follow the history of the investigation that the european commission did like
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.080]   Even even after they made their big, you know decision
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:19.680]   They didn't prescribe and say hey google here's what you did wrong and here's what you should do to fix it
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:25.040]   They were like hey google here's what you think you did wrong. What do you think you should do to fix it? And so
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.800]   It's really interesting that they're like how do we know if google's fixed it
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.800]   We're going to ask the people who complained and see if they like it or not and
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.440]   I don't know something about that
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.920]   I have a I have a lot of opinions, but that just seems a little strange
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:48.560]   Strange that the competitors would be would have such a powerful role in determining whether it's whether it's the right direction or not
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:54.480]   Well, if if the final arbiter is whether the people who complained are happy
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.600]   Yeah, you know, there was there was at least one that was funded by microsoft and now there's a detente where like
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.280]   Microsoft agreed not to sort of fund some of those anti
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:10.480]   Google lobbying groups like icomp and that sort of stuff I believe and so a lot of those pressures have sort of ratcheted down a little bit
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.120]   uh, but you know
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.920]   Why should chopping comparison engines show up and as opposed to say amazon or ebay?
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.880]   well, if it was the comparison chopping engines that complained rather than amazon or ebay then
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:28.240]   Asking what the right decision or remedy is to the shopping comparison engines
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:34.800]   You're probably going to end up with a result that is a little more favorable to shopping comparison engines and it's it's a little unclear to me
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:40.560]   If that's really what consumers want or if they'd rather have like a place like amazon or ebay where they can actually, you know
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:47.280]   Buy an object as opposed to comparing and doing another level of trying to look for where things would be so
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:57.600]   Yeah, so I wonder how long it's going to take for us to realize or for us to learn how the competitors
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:03.280]   Do actually feel I mean if this goes into effect right away. I'm sure it won't take very long
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.520]   It seems like early on they are not feeling very strongly about this as being
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:14.400]   Asian, um, you know, I think they're they're worried that ultimately this just means that they end up paying more for
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:19.680]   You know similar similar placement. I guess what I was saying as far as like, you know
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.680]   all it does is benefit google is
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:26.480]   If google has the ability like you were saying stacey of always
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:32.960]   Bidding up to a cap then no matter what I mean technically they could just always do that right and
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:35.280]   No matter what they're always making
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.440]   More than that and that could benefit google greatly in that regard
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:45.840]   But that would also probably not be that fair and the people that are judging the competitors would be very vocal about that
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:50.400]   So maybe that would be the who hasn't yeah who hasn't ever gained a charity auction just to bid up
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.560]   You know the price for your charity see it's it's it's it's the same sort of theory. Yeah, except not for charity
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.040]   So I don't know
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.120]   For google internal charity. Yeah
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:08.080]   Yeah, I will have to see how it goes if it is an auction though, then there is a little bit of an economic incentive to not
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.640]   Overbid so yeah
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.920]   We'll see how it all turns out. Yes. Yes
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.960]   Before we get to our final ad and then tips and tricks and picks and anything else that rhymes with that those words
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:28.720]   Are there any final stories that you wanted to talk about that we didn't jump to at all? Oh, oh, yes matt. Yes
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:32.080]   Calling in from dc. Hi long time
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:38.640]   Just the fact that the on the iphone they are switching to
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:45.440]   Away from Bing to use google search results in serie and spotlight like that's a pretty big change
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.800]   Um, that's another one where I really wish I could be a fly on the wall to hear all the different
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:55.040]   Negotiations and and what exactly happened there?
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.280]   Yeah, iOS and Mac OS users are gonna now get serie
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:06.720]   Get web search in serie pointed to google search not being although Bing will still be the default engine for image search
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.160]   And then youtube of course will be the default engine for video search
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:16.320]   Um, but this this seems to be timed with mac OS hyceira
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.320]   iOS 11
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:24.240]   Uh coming out, but yeah, that that really does seem like a big big change since since the beginning it's always been bing right
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:31.120]   I think it was google for was it? Well, I think it was in iOS
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:37.360]   I think serie might have always been bing or or you know apple was tilted towards bing for quite a while so okay
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.000]   Now if only the amazon echo could sign a similar deal so it's
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:48.480]   Because when you ask the amazon echo a question you get to bing and bing is not as satisfactory as google
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.800]   I don't see that happening, but
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.760]   Ooh, what happens with the home pod? Do you think that would go to bing or do you think?
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:00.720]   I mean because it doesn't have a that would be a competing product against google assistant basically
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.600]   Um good question that question even makes sense
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.800]   Uh-huh it may yeah, I mean I don't know the answer obviously
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.200]   Um no, no, I mean none of us do
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.280]   I don't yeah, I'm not really quite sure what that will mean
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.320]   Uh for the home pod when does the home pod looking it up right?
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.320]   December comes out in December. Okay
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:25.520]   Theoretically that's that's the stated date for now
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:33.200]   Wow and now that i'm looking at the home pod i'm like oh the smaller amazon echo has the same kind of met full body mesh thing going on
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.080]   They're all going in that direction aren't they?
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.440]   I I don't I don't I don't appreciate the full body mesh
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.520]   I or even the partial mesh that like the google home has I I'm just gonna like it
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.240]   Yeah, just make it all plastic
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:50.080]   You don't really just stick it up in the ceiling. Oh wait. No, I've got it
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:55.520]   Just work with my existing sonos and then i'm fine. Yes, I've heard it got those exactly exactly
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:01.440]   Um, I know one last one real quick and then I promise we will get to the ad and tips and tricks and all that kind of stuff
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:02.800]   Twitter
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.160]   Jumping from 140 characters to 280 characters
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.480]   How do we feel about this?
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.320]   Pending change that's probably going to happen that's rolling out to test users right now
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:15.360]   Doubling the amount of characters basically
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.080]   It's complicated issue
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:23.920]   But we are we all have thoughts. I cannot I cannot believe that this was their response to hey dude
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.720]   The president of the united states has you know like not started a war
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:34.240]   Let's say really mortally offended north korea and we might end up you know when like world war three because of it
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:38.160]   So twitter what's your role in all this and twitter is like, you know what?
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:42.400]   I have an idea. This is just add more characters. Let's just do it
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.600]   People need to be the ability to say more of those words
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.120]   We'll get more nuanced arguments and attacks. I'm sure
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:55.280]   Well, and it's funny how a lot of people have asked for the ability to edit tweets
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:31:00.560]   And so there was there was at least one where people were like, can we get the ability to edit tweets and like look?
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:04.720]   Everything's rounded now. Okay, but can I edit tweets look much more room?
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:11.520]   Uh, but you know was it frost who said, you know, the whole part about poetry is constraints
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:18.560]   So it'll be it'll be interesting if we're still complaining in a year like oh 280 is not enough or or how we'll look at it
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.800]   I'll be curious yeah, because we all got
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:26.080]   Sorry, we got really angry about the likes or the stars or whatever on twitter and now it's hard
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:32.480]   Or you know nobody it was fine. Sometimes it's just change aversion. So absolutely has changed aversion
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:35.600]   I know i'm guilty of that when I first thought I was like, yes, this is great
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:41.680]   How many times am I editing down my you know removing vowels and adding symbols in order to make a thing fit into a single tweet?
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:46.880]   So this will help with that and then the more I thought about it tomorrow. I was like wait a minute now instead of seeing little blurbs
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.680]   I'm gonna start seeing paragraphs and am I okay with that?
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:54.880]   And I so i'm really back and forth i'm trying not to hate it for changes sake
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.040]   um, but
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:01.840]   There the twitter did point out that in japan the service, you know
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.720]   many if not most of the words
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.680]   um
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:12.640]   Represented by symbols so 140 characters means something very different in japan than 140 characters in the english language
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:17.040]   Let's say that that felt very much like post rationalization right now. That's like
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:23.760]   Uh, yeah in japan, uh, they could totally say a lot more because their language is pictograms. Yeah
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:33.680]   But if that's 140 words versus 140 characters and they're not and they say only 1% of the tweets there use all 140 characters
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.560]   Uh, I don't know
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:43.280]   percentage of their tweets what percentage of their users or tweets are sent in japanese compared to english or
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.920]   russian or any other
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:52.240]   I mean though that's that again. That felt like i'm in the marketing team here. Let's tell them this
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:57.040]   We've got this fact this fact that we can throw in there. Yeah, that's a perfect fact for this
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.360]   Journalists love facts great
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:02.320]   It's true
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:09.360]   It's true. Yeah, I guess will remains to be seen how this uh what what this will do or how much it will actually matter
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:15.920]   But you're absolutely right matt. It's easy to get upset about things like this and then look back four months later and realize I don't care
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.160]   Yeah
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.160]   Oh, did I really get that upset over
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.440]   The service that lets me micro block really?
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:28.640]   Yep, exactly. All right, let's take a quick break
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:33.200]   Thank the sponsor of this episode and then we'll get into tips tricks and picks and all that stuff
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:39.760]   Uh, this episode of this week in google is brought to you by qualcom snapdragon gigabit lte
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:44.560]   We're I mean we live our lives on these devices. Maybe not this one because this one's really small
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:50.320]   Uh, but we definitely live our lives on devices more this size and they're connected to lte
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:56.640]   So we understand the effects of cellular network congestion in crowded environments
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:02.720]   Let's say airports shopping malls other busy areas things get slowed down your favorite apps become barely usable
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:07.600]   Uh all sorts of things happen when suddenly your bandwidth is cut down for those reasons
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:16.080]   And that's why snapdragon gigabit lte was designed to deliver the fastest mobile connectivity and help speed things up in crowded places
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:23.120]   With additional lanes for your data to flow on and the ability to squeeze more speed from each lte connection
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:32.720]   snapdragon gigabit lte is like driving on a much wider much faster data highway average lte download speeds are up to seven times faster
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.040]   Than typical home wifi
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:44.080]   And uh, it can turbo charge all of your connected apps as a result you can stream 360 degree videos in youtube vr and fork resolution with minimal
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.440]   Buffering or stuttering on the train or wherever you happen to be
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.640]   Will you be doing that? You can if you want to
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:56.240]   Access all of your files in the cloud nearly as fast as you would if they were stored on your phone
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:02.720]   That is what they're always driving for with cloud storage. You want it to feel like it's a local connected drive
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.960]   And here you can do that
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.640]   Uh download hours of movies or music in a matter of seconds
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.920]   You can also load android instant apps and it happens like true to the word it happens instantly
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:17.680]   Happens instantly because it has the the bandwidth to do that with
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:23.600]   Make the most of your unlimited data plan to learn more about faster network connections in crowded places
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.800]   Visit snapdragon.com/gigabit
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:33.360]   That's snapdragon.com/gigabit and we thank qualcom snapdragon gigabit lte for their support
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.680]   Of this week in google great to have you guys on board
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.760]   Uh, okay
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.160]   It's the tips time, uh stacey let's start with you. What's what she got? What's your thing?
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:50.320]   So I don't have a thing because i'm traveling and many of my recent things have been installed slash
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.120]   They don't fit suitcases. So instead
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.200]   I have a great book for you guys. Um, so this is
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.080]   This is a science book. It's about the five previous extinctions
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:08.240]   So we probably know about like the the triassic extinction where uh, not the dinosaurs
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.600]   Was that the dinosaurs the drastic was the dinosaurs anyway?
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.560]   Okay, I did read this book. I promise you guys
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:24.080]   It's it's basically like a geology book, but it's written really well peter brannon is the author and he does a great job
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:28.640]   making the subject both accessible but
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:36.000]   Interesting and then also relevant for today because it talks about my gosh the the overarching
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.320]   I guess the elephant in the room here is climate change and what we are doing
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.880]   Are we heading towards the next big extinction and?
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:50.880]   I just as a sciency kind of person. I really enjoyed it as a writer. I enjoyed his writing
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:54.720]   I'm going to tell you guys though that my husband tried to read it and he was like
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.960]   Yeah, but he reads more like malcolm gladwell business books that benefit him
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:05.040]   So this is probably more like if you're intellectually curious about things. It was it was a fun book for that that
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.680]   Those people so
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:13.600]   Um does it make you wonder if the world is going to end and if so is that fun?
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.800]   um, you know, hi
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.920]   I'm here at a security conference right now, so i'm like the world, you know, it might end
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:24.160]   But we might all just screw everything up before that
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.680]   There's a million reasons this could all go wrong
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.760]   Don't just think it's just the world ending it's all these other reasons too
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.640]   Like in geologic time, you know is the world good in a way?
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:43.120]   It was kind of comforting because you know the world actually ending because of our climate change and like mass species extinction
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.680]   Actually, this is going to take like a thousand years, you know, so
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:52.880]   That's oddly comforting. We might be really unhappy for the last 600 or even
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:57.840]   800 of it, but you know, we'll still be here at least we'll still be here
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.920]   We might not want to be here, but we will be
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:04.720]   That's it. We'll be we'll be tweeting 280 characters at a time
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.840]   Yes
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.960]   More space to talk about our feelings of existential dread
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:17.040]   Until he gets cut down to five characters and that that helps
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:21.360]   Uh, that helps us not enjoy our time, uh, whatever time we do have
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.520]   Um, all right. Excellent. So that is the ends of the world
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:32.880]   A volcanic apocalypse is lethal oceans and our quest to understand earth's past mass extinctions
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:37.920]   If you want to check it out there you go. There it is on amazon. Is there an audiobook? Yeah, there's an audiobook
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:41.280]   So you can listen to it as well. Yeah, right down there alley
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.560]   matt, what's your stuff?
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.800]   Okay, I am going to go from mass extinctions to a story of hope and happiness, which is
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:55.120]   uh, there's a lot of stuff in dc that people have opinions about but
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.240]   Everybody in dc that i've talked to really thinks that government could do better at technology
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.840]   Being more effective and more efficient and so one of the projects that we've worked on is called vet.gov
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.840]   It's a one stop shop where veterans or if you know someone who's a veteran
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:15.680]   Uh, please let them know about it. You can, uh, discover apply manage and track your benefits
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.560]   So everything from pension to burial benefits to gi bill comparison tools
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.040]   And we just passed a really big milestone
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.640]   2000 plus veterans have applied for health care benefits through this site
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:36.000]   Um, it's really wild because previously they would often have to use a paper form and they would have to wait over 100 days on average
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.200]   Now half of them get information within 10 minutes
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:46.400]   So I want to use this as a slight pitch to just say if you were listening to this podcast if you're watching right now
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:53.920]   This is a small team of people who who by building a web form were able to get more veterans their health benefits
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:40:00.560]   We've also got specific projects where we're trying to make it so that patients and doctors can have better health care
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:06.960]   So not just paying for the number of tests that they do but actually the quality of care how often do people come back to hospitals
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.520]   There's also projects
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.520]   Like at the small business administration
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:17.840]   We had a person start this week and from his oath ceremony basically walked him straight over to the small business administration
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.880]   Where he's helping with some of the disaster relief loan stuff related to the the recent hurricanes
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.440]   So there's a ton of really interesting projects
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:31.040]   Even soldiers, you know if you're moving across the country if you have a change of station that can be really stressful
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:36.640]   Trying to make that a more seamless better more efficient experience is something that's really important
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:43.680]   So whether it's something like bug bounties the federal government didn't have any kind of bug bounty until last year and the u.s
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.040]   Digital service specifically starting at the pentagon ran the very first one
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:51.040]   So if you have skills in you know site reliable engineering
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:55.360]   Engineering in general software engineering if you are a designer if you're a product manager
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:58.560]   Consider doing a tour, you know six months
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:05.200]   Maybe a year at the u.s. Digital service because there are a lot of great projects to work on and some really interesting things to tackle as well
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.000]   That's my oh my gosh
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.040]   Matt
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:13.680]   A couple weeks ago my husband sent me a chat and he is like stacey
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.640]   You should talk to matt cuts about using iot
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:25.680]   In the u.s. Government because I believe you tweeted about having your veterans affairs stuff attached to like a raspberry pie and a dashboard that's like
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:28.240]   showing people
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.280]   So
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.080]   I was I was really excited. I was like oh, I should I should talk to him about using iot in the government
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:41.200]   So this sounds very cool. Yeah, there's a lot of really interesting projects and even though the work is often hard
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.440]   Sometimes it's frustrating and sometimes the projects don't work out like i'm not going to sugarcoat it
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.640]   but
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.560]   At the end of the day you go home and you're like, okay, something got better not just for
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:57.040]   10 americans or a thousand americans but often 10,000 a hundred thousand a million americans and that is
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:02.560]   That is something that you can feel really good about so there's there's all kinds of interesting projects and hard problems to solve
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.440]   But also leveling up your skills working with different parts of the government and partners at different agencies
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.360]   It's it's been a wild experience and I'd recommend it for anybody to give it a try because you can really help a lot of people
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:23.440]   Awesome work. Um, that sounds fantastic. My dad is a veteran. I know how how challenging it can be at times for for veterans
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:26.960]   in a lot of these in a lot of these facilities so
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.160]   Fantastic work and that's got to feel good for you, man
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:37.680]   What you're doing? I know you did you did a lot of really great cool things for an insane amount of people at google
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:42.160]   But uh, I don't know at some point it's it's nice to kind of get that higher purpose
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:46.240]   You know what I mean to be able to really deaf people's lives and I'm sure that's exactly where you're at right now
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:52.640]   We are experiencing it's great to work with the teams. They're inspirational and and just coming into work every day
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.440]   It's a pleasure to work with them. Yeah, right on excellent stuff. Uh, that's dot gov
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.480]   Um mine is well for those of you who have a google home
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:07.280]   You probably have been asking I know I was probably from day one
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:13.040]   Why you couldn't set reminders on the google home if you could do it in assistant because you're in your kitchen
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:19.760]   You're doing things. It's it's like the the the ideas of what you need to do come to you when you least expect it when you're busy doing something
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.120]   Else you're doing the dishes
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:23.680]   You're zoning out and suddenly you think I need to do that thing
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:28.880]   I'll totally remember to do that thing and then you end up end the dishes and then you realize you didn't remember to do that thing
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:35.600]   When it's too late now you can set a reminder on your google home and I try I worked with it yesterday a little bit and it works really
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:40.240]   Well, you say okay g remind me at whatever time to do this thing
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:46.080]   And then it asks you to confirm it you save it once that time hits your google home will like go
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:50.800]   It does it lets out this little chirp for you and says I have a reminder for
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:57.680]   Jason and so then if you look at your google home, you'll see this single led light is permanently lit
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.800]   On the top. It's like a notification dot. So that tells you you have a notification waiting for you
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:09.680]   Uh, so then when you go to your google home, you say, okay, g what's my reminder or what's up or however you want to phrase that
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:13.120]   Pretty smart it it picks up on it and it reads back your reminder
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.960]   And the dot goes away
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.720]   And so you've kind of erased that off and you can do that thing that you wanted to remember how to do
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:24.560]   It also ends up sinking into your email if you've got it set up to do that already for your reminders to appear in your inbox
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:29.040]   Which I do also appears in your notification shade on your android device
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.040]   Uh, so it's a great way to fire off a reminder finally you can do it with google home
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:38.240]   They just rolled that out a couple of days ago and I think it's pretty much working on all google homes at this point
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.800]   So check it out. It comes in really handy
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.760]   That's that
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.520]   If you did know now you know
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:51.280]   Um, and that's I think for the episode is that as well. This was a lot of funny guys. Thank you so much
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:56.320]   Um for for coming on and and making it easy for me. I appreciate it
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.600]   It was a ton of it was a ton of fun. Yeah, no, it's and there was a lot of news to talk about too

[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:12.160]   This week in google and having like this this huge dump of google news and not having to go too far out
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:16.560]   I think amazon I also kind of put into that category with echo. There's a lot of crossover there
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:22.560]   Uh, so that that qualified that cuts, uh, tell people where you want everyone to to kind of follow
