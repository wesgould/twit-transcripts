[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   You'll hear it in Google Duo. And how Stacoms became the most trusted brand on the Internet.

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We cannot play it for you because we don't want the family to take us down.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But we played before the show a cute little video of an English family.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   All singing together doing their version of One Day More, rewritten for quarantine.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   That was the contribution, the gift of Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I have got a worm now in all their brains.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   They won't get that song over their heads for 24 hours.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It is pretty catchy.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   One day more.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Oh, God.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   His special link today on his Lower Third is his COVID Twitter list.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And it's something we talked about on the show before, but might as well make it easy for everybody to go to bitly, bit.ly/covid-tuitar-list.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And the reason you want that, of course, you have to have a Twitter account as you want to subscribe to it because he's put together a list of all the most reliable best sources for COVID information.
