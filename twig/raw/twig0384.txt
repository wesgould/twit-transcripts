[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.580]   Uh-oh there was a note. She didn't tell Santa. I wonder why
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.100]   This is the Mrs. Claus
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.100]   I won't
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.060]   He's only done. Oh, oh
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:46.620]   Easily done. It's really a British share. Here Mrs. Claus. My name is Jake. I know I'm six years old. Jake
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.860]   Stop taking my things. I have a big sister called Anna who is tall and sometimes angry
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:03.820]   I also have a dog called tiger who loves his two things
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.220]   He'll tell you he'll stop stop
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.580]   I'm sorry
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.100]   This Christmas I need your help
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.460]   So Mrs. Claus apparently is the high tech of the two
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.460]   I know you can get it from me
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.940]   She takes the snowmobile to the helicopter
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.340]   While Santa's pottering around in a sleigh with some old
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.540]   caribou
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.940]   She jets off
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.860]   To London town
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.420]   where the little boy lies disconsulate
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.780]   And delivers a lovely marks and Spencer gift
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.100]   Queen
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.380]   She does she looks like Julie Denshes or Helen Mirren. Oh, thank you
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.340]   Oh, she's eating a little bit of a dog. I'm gonna take that with me
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.620]   She's clearly the more
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.420]   Powerful of the two so that when I say Mrs. Stacy is the real Stacy is that's that's who I'm talking about Stacy
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.300]   I'm not talking about some daughtering old lady. I'm talking about the powerful
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.420]   Helen Mirren claws your head
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.620]   rides in on a helicopter
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.060]   delivering. Oh, awesome tastes sneaks
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.580]   Love my sister
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.460]   And I think she didn't give him the note because it was
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.180]   To say this is close. Yeah to her. Yeah
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.780]   Yes, she's the competent one of the duo
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.900]   Oh, she she's pretending that she's still just napping you gotta show this now don't
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.220]   She's just napping and Santa comes back after his hard day. She's reading a romance
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.140]   She's reading 50 shades of gray or something. No, it wasn't gray
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.940]   Was a red it was a red
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.260]   50 shades of red
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260]   That
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.780]   That puts a whole unsettling twist on Santa Claus. Yeah
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.500]   King's going on there in a closet house
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.100]   It's cute. Isn't it? I like that. I like that

[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.340]   Scrooge
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:01.340]   What are you all doing for the holiday? I think uh here it's pretty clear that you're dressing up as some sort of pagan
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:07.820]   religious figure uh stacey and that is that is my plan is is there a crampus involved
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.780]   There is no crampoline
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.900]   My favorite horror movie of the season I have to say
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.020]   It's it at the only horror movie of the season this
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.020]   I mean, do we do we need more christmas horror movies that reminds me though christmas eve?
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.100]   I think we should we should watch crampus
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:32.700]   It beats miracle on 34th street. I gotta say or or love actually which is a terrible movie that everyone is like oh, it's christmas
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.420]   Oh, it's romantic and it's christmas eve and
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:43.260]   Yeah, elf. elf is our our job. I think it's a great movie. I even cry at the end. I'll be honest
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.180]   I'm like oh you cry why?
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.740]   Because they believe in sina and they they make the slaco and it's
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.700]   Yeah, you can't see that's beautiful who doesn't believe in sina after all
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:02.220]   Um, not a little trump. It's not no. Oh you had to get it in there
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.100]   Let's let the records show last week that I think I was definitely trying to change a subject
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.540]   And I think so was stacey. It was me always in trying to change it was you it was my fault
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.940]   I was playing you
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.980]   I always get playing. I'm always gonna play but we did right stacey didn't read prodigy to subject last week
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.500]   Well, I we did I
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.140]   Yes, as I have mentioned to a few people in who you mail me about 18,000
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:32.220]   the uh, there is going to be some intersection of tech and uh politics
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.420]   Maybe more so than usual this coming year
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:41.740]   Net neutrality net neutrality is going to be on the table. Uh free trade is going to impact uh silicon valley
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.860]   Um, then there's gonna be a lot of that. I think it's gonna be very interesting. Uh, and we will cover it in that regard
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:53.260]   but I uh somebody said, you know, not all trump voters are stupid. I don't think we said that and I certainly don't believe that
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.420]   so, um
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.500]   I apologize if I gave that impression
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:03.180]   How about alphabet self-driving car subsidiary waymo? What about that, huh?
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.700]   Yay self-driving minivans
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:12.220]   You know, I was talking to lisa the uh other day and she said what we really need is self-driving buses
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:20.060]   Is do we really want to uh, put a lot of individual people in cars on the road even if the car's driving itself?
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.700]   Well from a legit depending on
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.180]   in cities
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.180]   Self-driving buses make sense
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.420]   in suburban areas
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.460]   No
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.700]   I mean, I would love a minivan actually that self-driving that I would go like a little minibus route among our neighborhood to get my kids to school
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.700]   Yeah, exactly
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.180]   Most people
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.340]   I think the idea is once it's self-driving it'll come to you when you need it pick you up and then wander off to where you're going
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.220]   The end game of self-driving cars is the end of personal car ownership because that's really wasteful
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.820]   Uh, no, my car, you know, a ton of metal
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.300]   rubber plastics
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   Uh is sitting in the parking lot all day
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.580]   Uh, and so with with with with the future of autonomous vehicles is you don't even have to own a car
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.620]   You just what you know, you you uber it basically and and you get a different is I wrote this in what we're googled in you
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.100]   You get a different car for a different need
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.380]   Right going up a nice date. Give me the give me the Audi
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.780]   Uh, hauling some crap from Home Depot give me the pickup truck
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.020]   That could be a nice date
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.380]   By the way, the pickup truck to home. We'll go into Home Depot
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.020]   No
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.860]   I'm like, I love Home Depot. I think she means it. I think she means it. No
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:39.660]   I'm just gonna say that I'm pro Home Depot or those I'm pro Home Depot. Don't don't get me wrong
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.740]   But date night
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:47.420]   Sure, you get it like you go to a nice restaurant to drink a bottle of wine and then you can borrow some home
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.020]   Improvement shopping. You didn't mention drunk Home Depot. That's a different matter entirely
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:56.140]   Oh, well, it's not like you can hollow out the the aisles and make a little house inside
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.940]   I have never done that. I will work on that
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.260]   I saw a video somebody doing that like at a big big box store
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.540]   There are people living those sometimes
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.820]   Well, yeah, so there was a story just just today about um
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.540]   authorities trying to get teens
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.460]   I he is trying to stop teens from
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.940]   Making it a thing to sneak inside and sleep exactly
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:24.700]   Oh, that reminds me. What's that book? Everyone read it when they were kids. Uh, the mixed up files of miss basil e
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.860]   Franken
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.900]   Willer
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.380]   Someone helped me come on. Uh, they it's these two kids and they go with they run away from home
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.540]   And they live in the metropolitan museum of art
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.940]   Anyone no one like this. This is just me. I think this is it
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:48.700]   There excuse me. No, pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Uh, this is a youtube video of two idiots at night in iKEA
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.940]   Uh, definitely swedish
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.860]   Uh, hey, the good news is iKEA you can get food
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:04.780]   Meatballs and fries. That is the most unhealthy lookin meal. Oh and a little lingonberry jam on the side. They're definitely swedish
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:11.820]   Is good. That is like the lingonberry, huh? He's drinking lingonberry juice too basil basil e frankweiler
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.060]   Oh, there you go. Okay, so this book they go and they live in the
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:21.180]   I would like to read it. That looks good. It's a great book. I mean it's for kids. Uh, uh
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:28.700]   Oh, oh, I was thinking about self-driving cars. So now we're going back to our original conversation. I was thinking
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.380]   The the distribution and how you're going to apportion out like the number of cars and where they're going to be located
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.900]   Yeah, so I think they might learn a lot from like the airline industry
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:46.380]   And if you think about like different hub and spoke models for like airports, so I'm just trying to think and federal
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.980]   And FedEx yeah. Oh, yeah, like yeah, it just takes a distribution
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.540]   So maybe those companies have something to offer here that
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.180]   You know other people are there right so it's so stacy, but there's another interesting part about that
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:03.020]   Which is that of course airlines by the need of all the regulation and the and the spots and all that
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.780]   They're scheduled if airlines could be more on demand. Oh
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:13.500]   Right, it'd be a I don't know if I want to do that as soon as we get 25 more people this flight will take off
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:20.140]   Yeah, anybody anybody want to go to cleveland. Yeah. No, we only need 25 more
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.020]   Well, see I don't think
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.420]   Trains and cars are going to be scheduled
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:33.100]   I feel like self-driving cars may end up being more scheduled than not they're probably going to look closer to like a city bus
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.100]   They should just like or a subway that runs kind of constantly
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:43.660]   I remember talking to brad templatin who is of course a legend on the internet was one of one of the creators of use net and his big
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.620]   You know autonomous vehicles now. I don't know if he's at google
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.420]   But he's very much involved in it and it was his he this was a couple of years ago
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:58.460]   At a christmas party of all things and he I talked to him for a long time and he really was of the opinion that the key to self-driving cars is eliminating
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:05.500]   Auto ownership. The last thing you want is you know, though everybody in the country owning, you know 1.25 cars
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.220]   It's a waste of raw natural resources
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.660]   But you wouldn't need one. It's just as you said jeff you might
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.380]   Get a car that would take you to an RV that you would then take you to
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.580]   A pinnacles national monument that would then take you home in a car would take it the rest of the way
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:27.660]   And I think I could see uber doing this. I really can I think that that's what uber sees as its endgame, right?
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:33.900]   The question is can uber make it there because this year uber lost three billion dollars
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.220]   lost
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.060]   Three i'm not talking about revenue. This is what they lost
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.660]   Uh, they've never been profitable. Have they?
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.940]   Yeah, a m d was never profitable is
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:54.060]   They are spending the investors money at a burn rate that is astounding they
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.300]   The revenue was 5.5 billion. They lost three
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.460]   That's up from 2.2 billion lost last year
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.940]   Um
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:11.580]   uber does not comment on financials. They're not publicly held so this comes from that not this comes from our friends at the information
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.100]   Amira friday once again with the great scoops
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.780]   Uh, that is just mind-poggling
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:24.860]   They lot the gross revenue was affected somewhat by the fact that they lost china
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:32.940]   Right, that's true. Oh, right. I couldn't grow at the right, but they would have been but you know along with the growth in revenue comes a growth in losses
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.540]   so
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.900]   uh
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.900]   Wow
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.380]   Does it show their loss per trip?
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.860]   Oh interesting
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.460]   Or is that a metric that I assume that's a metric that would make sense for them
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.660]   But I don't know but that's that's you know unless you knew how many trips they did and again uber doesn't talk about any numbers
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:58.220]   Right lift is estimated to be losing about a hundred million a quarter or 400 million in in in the year
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.460]   um
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.700]   Why why it boy uber's private valuation is 70 billion dollars
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:11.340]   But some of that was based on the fact that it was in china. They had to sell the chinese operations to a didi
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.940]   Um, although they have a 17 equity stake in didi, so that is not so bad
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.740]   So this is a loss to get them on everyone's phone
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:27.020]   Until they can replace drivers with which is a huge expense. I think that's the key right?
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:32.540]   Yeah, and ultimately in an environment where everybody has to take an uber because they don't own car
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.820]   And I have to say, you know my daughter
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.260]   uh
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.460]   Besides the fact that she had a number of accidents. So there was a safety issue involved. You know fender benders
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.460]   Uh, it was more expensive. I told I said we're getting rid of your car
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:51.420]   Take an uber anytime you need an uber or a lift to take it and i'll pay for it
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:58.220]   And it did end up being cheaper than car ownership when you include gas insurance and and accidents
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.460]   Where does she live?
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.900]   uh bay area
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.900]   Oh, okay, like you couldn't
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.420]   You couldn't do that in texas
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.460]   Um, I don't know you have to be somewhere where there's enough density of uber's to make it worth. Yeah, well, no
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.260]   I was just thinking about any public. I mean, I assume sometimes she walks places or takes public transit
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:22.140]   Well, she's in college. So on campus she walks
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:27.900]   But okay, so she doesn't if she wants to get into town and the town's not that far away, but it's a few miles
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:35.340]   She uses an uber and there's enough uber at uber x's and and lifts around that it it's it's easier than a cab really
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.740]   I think a lot of people in urban areas like new york and san francisco
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:45.500]   Do that they don't own car well for years people in new york have an own cars because it's just impractical
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.620]   And take mass transit but uber makes that even more doable
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:54.060]   Is that sure i never rent a car anymore? I'm always uber in places. There you go
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.660]   Well, but so let me ask you about that. So so when I go to san francisco though
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.340]   I come to the airport
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.740]   And I you know go to facebook and that goes somewhere else I go back to facebook and then I go to a restaurant and they go somewhere else
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.460]   Then I go to google and by the time you add up all the ubers
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:13.100]   And waiting for them and all that the rema car in that kind of market in l.a. And san francisco still seems better to me
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.620]   I guess so I take
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.940]   I I plan my trips a little bit more clumped
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.540]   So I do plan around the fact that i'm not going to have a car and then
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.180]   I also usually
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.740]   End up spending half the time in the city so I rent the car in the city and then I want to drop it off at the airport
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.620]   And they charge it like a hundred dollar change fee or like a hundred dollar fee to drop something off elsewhere
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:41.900]   So it almost like i've worked it out. It always comes out either even or less
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.700]   when I had done it so
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:50.620]   But it could be because i'm planning i'm thinking that way well, but also remember jeff that's a high intensity use
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.700]   And that's not how you use it all year round. So you're probably you may be right that for that particular situation
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.220]   Yeah, i'm just saying I still i would like to stop raining cars too. I grew as dacey
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:07.020]   But I just find that especially in california. I can't right however on a year round basis. It would stop still probably be
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:11.580]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, financially. Well, I feel like no because I use that car
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.100]   I have to take my kid to school and pick her up. So that's two trips a day
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.660]   Um, if you go to work. Yeah
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.380]   I i'm just thinking about like how the rest of the world may live if you're in
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:29.900]   One thing though a lot of the expenses of car ownership are hidden
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:36.780]   Right. I mean that's why we love that automatic because suddenly you understand it costs you four dollars to drive your daughter to school
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.940]   And four dollars to get her back
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.540]   And then you add to that the cost of insurance the monthly fees
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.260]   uh, you know, there's the the times I smash in defenses or
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.900]   I mean get up. Yeah, I mean
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.180]   I it's clear to me that I save money with my daughter
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.100]   But that's because of her use pattern and so forth
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:03.980]   Um, but and I just think a lot of the expenses of a car ownership or hidden expenses in any event
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.500]   I don't I don't know if uber has a path to profit. I mean, um
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.300]   the take rate
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.580]   From the drivers is about 20 percent of gross revenue
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.900]   Uh, if you eliminate the drivers
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:25.660]   There is a much better take rate, but there's also a much higher upfront capital cost to
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.860]   Creating the autonomous vehicles and buying them and so forth
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.060]   Right. Uh, I'm wonder. I mean, I think uber is a high risk bet because
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.020]   uh
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.140]   It says because it operates and this is a mirror rafrodi again and the information because it operates
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.060]   In developed markets that will generate the biggest proportion of expected
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:51.660]   Profits in the industry places like the us uber can afford to lose money for a long time
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.780]   In the developing markets where any profits will be tiny by comparison. So
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.060]   China, india
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.140]   Hard to make money
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:08.620]   Many of those developing markets are still a land grab opportunity or uber firmly believes it's worth losing some money in the near term
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.340]   In order to become the market leader after which you can focus on profits
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.980]   So it's exactly as you said they're buying market share
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.140]   Right now. This is this is the silicon valley approach right then
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:22.220]   It's just that this is a very expensive place. You know way to buy market share
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.940]   Google didn't have to lose six billion dollars a year to become the premier search engine
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.660]   Well, okay, but think about something that requires actual infrastructure
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:37.180]   Remember back in like 1998 or something when akamai was building out its network and this is
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.500]   And the only reason that those companies and there were lots of companies
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.940]   Amazon's the canonical example, right? Yeah
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:50.860]   Well, I was trying to pick physical infrastructure. I guess they have oh no, that's what they spent all their money on was distribution centers
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.380]   Yeah
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.380]   They lost money for a decade
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.980]   uh because they pumped every bit they made amazoned into
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.620]   warehouses
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.620]   So similar I think high capital. Yeah
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.460]   There is
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:14.940]   With the tech boom with all the like telecoms infrastructure the bankruptcies in 2000 and 2001 or what helped that because then
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.260]   What you had is these massive capital expenses that were just written off and then
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.220]   So I wonder if something like if uber goes bankrupt for example, I'm not saying they will
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.860]   Um, that would be like a veritable bargain
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:34.620]   So exactly because they've but you know what that's by the way that's history says that that's what happens in boom busts
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.980]   And the most recent one was the
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.700]   Dot compost in the year 2000
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:48.700]   Uh, all those companies and all that invested money that went, you know was lost except that the infrastructure they built things like fiber
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:56.540]   Uh, make it possible now for the next generation of companies to succeed. You can go back to the railroad same thing happened with the transcontinental railroad
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:01.260]   All the companies that built the transcontinental railroad went bankrupt and flamed out
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.980]   but we got a railroad and
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.420]   Subsequent, you know train companies did fine
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.460]   So there's a very good precedent for that. I think your right state say that it could be that uber is
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.660]   You know the transcontinental railroad of
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:22.220]   And they'll leave us they'll leave us awesome ai that's that's the question is so then what is their asset that actually
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.340]   Retains its value or the either market share doesn't does it. I mean, yeah
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:32.620]   And maybe this explains why google or alphabet has decided not to build cars
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.500]   They don't want to be in that position. They they want to be the supply
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.980]   They want to be the leave eyes and the picks and the axes to the gold rush
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.500]   Uh the picks and shovels knew they were going to come out today
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.260]   I love driving that one out. Good and burgundy next don't worry
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.220]   Drake Drake Drake
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.500]   um
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.300]   Yeah, I wonder whether those deals will require things like
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.940]   Android auto in an android auto
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.020]   You know, we totally lost me
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:10.140]   In other words will will will google require that you use their connectivity and their entertainment and their
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.580]   No
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.940]   Bapping in the car that maybe well, maybe you get maybe not requirement. Maybe fiat christmas buys a bundle
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.540]   That includes all of that and the autonomous
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.700]   You know because we you know the bed is that if you're not driving or not paying attention
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:29.100]   You're everywhere in the car. Yeah. Yeah entertainment matters. Yeah. Yeah. I actually have much sense big
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.460]   That makes less on the mapping site. It could be a legal liability because
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.180]   if you think about you have to figure out
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:40.060]   What's part of the intelligence of the car because if you're if you're selling that
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.980]   You're going to be liable for that, right? So you've got a really strictly control
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.940]   What's going to be happening there like the information coming to and from the car?
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.500]   So where do you draw the line in those packages? But the music system. I don't think that it's going to affect
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:57.100]   You know the car really I don't know I drive faster when i'm listening to things like rage against the machine
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.420]   Oh, I think the user interface will be will be hey google take me to the store
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.980]   Yeah, and there would be an opportunity to monetize that in the way google monetizes
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.100]   I don't support navigation yet. She says oh you she heard you
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.900]   Yeah, she did nice. So I've got a real thing
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:17.500]   I just want to mention just a side note on an android auto real quickly because you know the android auto app now
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.460]   Uh will launch on the pixel
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.500]   Automatically as soon as you get in the car
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.140]   Well, unfortunately every time lisa gets in her car. I guess I've paired my bluetooth
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:32.380]   So i'm sitting in the house lisa gets her car and my all of a sudden my pixel goes to auto
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.820]   And for the life of me. I couldn't figure out what was going on. It took me a few days ago
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.620]   Oh lisa just left she's i'm pairing to her
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:44.700]   So here's the other thing is my pixel c yeah for the last like four or five days
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:49.340]   It doesn't even know today, but it but it keeps on telling me I didn't hear what you said
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.860]   Did you talk to me? I didn't hear what you said. I didn't understand what you said
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:58.140]   Something is triggering without me saying heyg wg dl-e
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:05.180]   Uh, that was what was the case for a while right so certain voices had come up, but they weren't saying the brand they weren't saying google
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.420]   Um, and I was in a hotel room that was still gonna
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.540]   War and buzz and it was very strange. Yeah
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.820]   If I were like a marketer, I would be like
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.860]   Hey google
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.820]   You know my pants ask ask about you know
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.260]   Levi's jeans and then suddenly your phone's gonna come up and you're like what the
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.420]   Like little gorilla marketing tactics. Oh, oh
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:36.380]   As a little some little triggering that's happening already if you want us a real good conspiracy theory
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.260]   Oh, it is in audible audio signals from coming from your tv to your phone
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.380]   Oh, that is actually a real thing. Yes
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:50.620]   We don't know how widespread it is. I was like it's not a conspiracy theory. It's it's actually a real thing. Yeah
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.860]   Yeah, your phone is literally listening to your tv
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.380]   This was a year ago in the Atlantic
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.140]   The tv's on in the background. You're applying to a quick email on your phone nearby
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.260]   You don't know, but the devices are communicating during the commercial the tv
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.820]   Emits an inaudible tone in your phone
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.300]   picks it up
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.460]   And some way somewhere far away a server makes a note both devices probably belong
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.100]   to you
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.100]   Uh, and that's real that's happening
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.500]   Silver push is the as the leading provider of audio beacons
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.940]   in audible ultrasonic
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.980]   Pings that devices
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:37.660]   Respond to you have to have an app installed with the silver push code, but apparently there's there's a few
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:44.860]   I think this is just a matter of time right where this is widespread
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:50.220]   That's the paranoid people are always saying to me. Oh, I would never have an amazon echo in my house
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.780]   Cause I don't want amazon to listen to our conversations
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.340]   That's the least of it. Yep
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:00.220]   It's listening, but in ways that are a little more subtle. I think
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.700]   But I don't know that's why I call it a conspiracy theory
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:13.100]   By the way, uh to this point here's an article from uh, New York magazine
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.020]   Google home secret weakness the word google
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.820]   Oh, I love this article. Yeah. Yeah. Well, tell us about it. Stace
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:28.700]   It's basically that google is is it hard to listen to and hard to say is it both of those are just hard to say
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.740]   Hard to say
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.220]   Well, I mean it is kind of a weird word to say
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:42.860]   Here's the this is my favorite quote from the article when yelling at the speaker to shut off an alarm in the morning
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.860]   It often comes out as a mumbly. Yeah
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:52.300]   I Nancy had a perfect leaf first thing in the morning
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.100]   Right, you're Dutch to be
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:31:01.740]   I did I like the article because I learned a new term the schwa schwa schwa
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:07.260]   Brendan hudek a speech language pathologist a speech coach at the new york speech coaching
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:15.500]   Says that it has to do with the unstressed syllable created by the second half of the name a k a the schwa
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.580]   By the way schwa is also the name for that alien picture
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.740]   You know with the big eyes and the and the head shaped like an apostrophe
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.540]   Oh really it's also called a schwa
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.180]   Oh
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.980]   If you were to separate the word into its phonetic components you would get goog and luh
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:39.100]   He suggests that because there's not a true vowel separating the first and second syllables
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.700]   It might make it feel like you're tripping over it. It might be it could feel like you're mumbling
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.300]   It should be goog-el-o
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.500]   What should it be? I don't know it's not like we don't say the word google all the time, but I'm trying to get the word recognized by a
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.220]   speech recognition
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.260]   I hate this because I do say the word google all the time
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:02.300]   It's constant in our house and I'm like why would you be so arrogant irritating is to not give it a personality or a name a Jarvis
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.140]   a my sick job is a fun idea
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.340]   That's what mark zuckerberg chose
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:14.860]   Watch the video. That's what you you've got to watch the video at least at the point of the parents coming over
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:20.060]   Okay, it's a very important moment. I saw your facebook post about this and you said something like
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.780]   How strange it is to have your name, but you could get used to it
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.260]   Yeah, yeah
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.060]   This is uh, this is the fast company article at home
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.060]   With mark zuckerberg and Jarvis the AI assistant he built for his family
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.060]   Which by the way, you know mark said I thought I should be able to do at least as well
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.700]   As uh, as an amazon echo
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.100]   It's you know, he duplic- I don't see what he really accomplished to be honest
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:52.060]   Yeah, kevin and I talked about this on the our show, but I mean, it's it's like a custom amazon echo
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:58.940]   It's not any better. Which one is the one with his parents? Which is go go go up go up. It's that first one first one first
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:05.100]   Okay with it with the view of the back porch. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, so you come up against to mark's house
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.780]   Are you getting my audio?
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:13.260]   Plus mark it bed with pj's is trying to be a little nuts, but well, you know what?
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.700]   One of the things I enjoyed about this video. Let me get my audio going. I turned it off
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.740]   Yeah, uh, one of the things I enjoyed about this video help run our home is that to Jarvis using i
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:27.020]   He leads he leads such a normal looking what they don't have any pictures in the wall
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:33.820]   It's like they just moved in. I'm thinking this isn't actually their bedroom that this is shot in an iqia
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:39.180]   I think they they they took down the red wire sanitized. Yeah, the renoir exactly
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.060]   Oh, you know what that's what it is
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:47.740]   Yeah, we used to have where to go on the wall, but we just decided it was too disturbing an image
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:55.420]   68 no wait a minute stop what is this he's got a pile. He doesn't have a bedside table
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.300]   He has a book
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:05.500]   There's those models of beds that have the little oh no, he does have just a pile of books and and carefully cultivated by the way
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:14.380]   Well, he knows. Yeah. Yeah, so this is Priscilla's side is which side of you sleep on we could tell from the books
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.580]   Let's see. Oh 50 shades of red is on the left there. So
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.700]   I started building a simply i to help run our home
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.340]   I talked to Jarvis using this app I built yes
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.700]   He uses artificial intelligence to understand me and figure out what to do
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:33.180]   Max woke up a few minutes ago. I'm entertaining wait a minute wait a minute morgan freeman
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:40.700]   Yes, Jarvis sounds like morgan freeman. I'm so hurt. I am I volunteered to voice it. You know
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.180]   Jarvis is morgan freeman. Yes. He's got the voice of god. Yes, he does. Yes
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:50.780]   That's james old jones
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.460]   God's james ril jones
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:35:00.220]   I was such a god was james r
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.220]   Is a large vader
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:07.580]   James ril jones is Darth vader which maybe you live in the dark side. I don't know. I I am I am a sith
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:15.420]   We don't call it the sith we call it the alt alt right now it's the new please we don't
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.060]   Very important. All right more Jarvis
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.820]   Let's practice our man
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:25.580]   Let's practice our men know Jarvis your manorin is so soothing
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.500]   Fisher
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.100]   Jarvis also helps me get ready in the morning this shirt firing a hole
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.260]   Okay, this is a joke. Of course it is, but I love it. Yeah, he has a
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.740]   T-shirt cannon in his closet. That's the greatest
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.260]   It's time for my call with shrimp. Can you get him on the video conference line?
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.020]   Butter or something on the toast mark
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.900]   Remember to check on the AI guidance system for Akila one of the best things about Jarvis
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.140]   Yeah, that's the plane that they crash landed
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.140]   I was gonna say that was a huge little inside joke
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:59.820]   Is that that's it internal check the internal guidance that was funny that they did that little self mockery, isn't it?
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.780]   Yeah
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.180]   And by the way, the reason there's no butter on the toast is that mark doesn't eat anything he didn't kill himself
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:10.540]   Well, we're milking it could recognize people at the gate let them in automatically and then just tell me about it
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.500]   Mark your parents are coming in
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.380]   Thanks Jeffrey. It's Jarvis and Jarvis. I love that moment
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:23.100]   I love it. You love it because you're Jeffrey Jarvis
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.500]   that uh
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:31.740]   I think you're in the v i think no, I don't think so, but you think that's just you think that's just accidental
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:36.460]   There's some other inside Jeffrey joke, but I love it. I have so when I was watching I laughed out loud
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:43.260]   I think that's you. I think that's a little nod to you. No, I don't think so. There's a lot of Easter eggs in this
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:50.540]   By the way, this was posted a few days ago 19 million views. I'm afraid I can't do that
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:54.060]   There are no good nickelbacks on
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:37:00.700]   Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is great. I haven't seen this one. Oh, you haven't seen
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:06.620]   Oh, no, I saw the I saw the videos that fast company shot. Oh, no, no, no, this is a promo video
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.540]   Go back. Go back. Let's play the Jeffrey again. Just so I can hear it again. Oh, jeff
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:16.700]   The best thing about Jarvis is it could recognize people at the gate let them in automatically and then just tell me about it
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.660]   Mark your parents are coming in
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.060]   I can offer you some if this is
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.860]   step time
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:29.900]   This is jeff's one moment of the noise. I well I deserve that because I step on her all the time
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.220]   It's only right state. She was Santa's blaming you about it
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.100]   Mark your parents are coming in
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.580]   Thanks Jeffrey. It's Jarvis
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:47.180]   And Jarvis can play all of our favorite music. Hey play us some good nickelback songs. I'm sorry mark. I'm afraid I can't do that
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.020]   There are no good nickelback song. That's how
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:56.140]   Good that was actually a test. Okay, how about just play some songs that our whole family likes
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.100]   See
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:05.660]   What I'm a dad now. This is what I listen max and Priscilla Jarvis also likes to join our family for oh wait a minute
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.740]   That is not a comforter. Wait a minute stop
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.980]   Okay, that is not a comforter. They have a dog
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:18.300]   This is the ultimate privilege. This is the ultimate privilege. They have a dog with dreadlocks
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.900]   It's a pulley. It's a what it's a pulley
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:27.100]   That's the kind of dog that has dreadlocks. Oh, you don't have to like send it to the dreadlock hairdresser to get
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.540]   No
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.540]   Grow that way
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.740]   Doesn't it look like a comforter? Only if you put the beads in no
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.300]   It looks like a sesame street muppet
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.060]   It's the
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.180]   Sweet dog
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.460]   Tickle next I think we should tickle max
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.780]   I'm also experimenting with other voices
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.340]   Stop her just getting away
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.700]   Do it now
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.460]   That was our own talk. I can just text Jarvis through a messenger bot that I built
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.980]   Well, this happens all the time in our house
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.180]   Yeah, my bad
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.220]   So this has been pretty fun, but I need some more ideas for Jarvis
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.380]   So leave them in the comments and I'll try to build some of them
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:12.940]   All right, movie time Jarvis you got it mark first. I need to teach you to make me some more popcorn
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:17.820]   So what was the point of making this video? I'm just curious
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.220]   humanizing Facebook
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:26.380]   Because that's so I hadn't seen the fact that they made a promo video for this
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.020]   Yeah, isn't that great what she says below
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.860]   You know
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.820]   Obviously, this is a joke video. You know, it's not the real thing
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.860]   and yet
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:43.100]   I got the impression okay from the article that those things had actually happened like that
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:50.860]   You know, it said I thought it said in the article like though like everyone's wallet makes mistakes like turning off the lights when Priscilla's downstairs in her office
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:57.660]   So some of this is true the nickelback stuff. I don't think is true, but the stuff about the AI for the parents
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.660]   Tying into his crust on lights just some all of that's actually real
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.140]   Okay and being able to talk to something and text it through facebook messenger is also real
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.180]   so
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.700]   I don't I don't know if you know, it actually
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.340]   Fathers me a little bit if the promo video bled into the story
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.940]   You know, oh someone's saying the nickelback stuff is a hundred percent true
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.660]   Wow that there is
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.940]   Yeah, there is no but he can he can are no good
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.860]   hard code that is
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:34.220]   Not wrong, but yes, I mean he could hard code jokes and stuff in I doubt it and that's not
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.860]   I mean well first of all, that's not Jarvis's voice, right? I don't think he got morgan freeman to record
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.420]   No, he did with the voice tracks
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:48.220]   Um, let's say morgan freeman is that dude in the video? So is morgan freeman really Jarvis? I don't know
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:56.700]   So usa today says that morgan freeman will
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:03.340]   Be morgan freeman. So yes, I think that's more of the promo bleeding into the reporting
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:10.060]   And this I don't like this is very much a manipulation by by facebook of this story
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.860]   I think
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:20.140]   And what I don't like it is when stuff that's in the promo the made-up comedy promo becomes fact
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.740]   I'm
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.340]   So down at the bottom. There's there's a there's a guardian piece guardians been quite
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.460]   Um lot. I recently I love them dearly with them
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:37.260]   You knocked them hard today. I forgot what it was bad. I did. Yes. Oh, they have the peak guardian peak guardian. Was that it? Yeah
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   Yep guardian. Yeah
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.700]   I can't remember what they were talking about but uh, yeah
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.180]   It was a guy who who's giving up all technology
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.500]   And they loved it. They loved it. Of course. They absolutely loved it. Uh, no, I didn't put it at the bottom
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:55.340]   I put it somewhere in the um the guardian says 200 2016 the year facebook became the bad guy
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:42:01.100]   Yeah, right. So I think that there you know, and I don't say this cynically, but I think there is some desire to
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.740]   um humanize
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.740]   uh facebook. Yeah
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.500]   I think
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.660]   I think that you're gonna start say okay
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.340]   We need a I need like a buzzer politics alert
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:19.740]   But it's not really politics. We had a great interview on monday with a tim wu who of course is genius
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:25.180]   I created the master switch, but his new book is about the ad industry. You got to read it. Jeff
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.580]   I know I do. I know I have actually brilliant
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.820]   Yeah, brilliant
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.700]   Uh, and it was a fascinating interview. It should have gone on for 10 hours
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.180]   There's so much stuff to talk about in there
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:40.620]   but one of the things that we were talking about is uh, the techniques which
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.540]   The trump campaign used to win the election very very very effectively
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:49.660]   And what I do think is going to happen is that I think mark is the number one person who have learned from this
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:54.220]   And I think this is to me a little bit of an example of manipulating
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.260]   the story
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.260]   I mean when does pr cross into manipulation
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:06.780]   Well, that's a funny thing. So last night I went to a dinner with a it was off the record
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.940]   So a pr company to be unnamed getting together a bunch of journalists and technologists to kind of say
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.260]   What do we do? What are our clients do?
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:19.820]   There was interesting conversation, but as somebody said to me afterwards a little paradox in this dinner that you know pr invented vik news
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.540]   um, uh and invented all that but yes, um
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.980]   It's amazing to me
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:35.020]   How all these parties I've had conversations now with facebook and google over the last two weeks about this and they're there there
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.860]   I will best find their taking this. Yes, they're taking this very seriously and incidentally
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:43.900]   I'm glad google is because it's really not facebook. That's that's the main call, but it's google
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.740]   So so I will I'll say what I said to them not what they said to me
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.620]   um, but one of the things that I said is that is that
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:56.700]   And I've said this publicly you guys the platforms try to argue that you are reflecting the world
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:03.500]   And you act as if the world is then true the world is warped because you exist. Yeah, right?
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.060]   It's short short ogres platform, right?
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:11.660]   And and they and they're not being oddly they're not being savvy enough about that. They're not
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:19.100]   Recognizing so my advice is that you have to map the distortions so that you can act differently at the points of distortion
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:24.860]   Um, and how do you do that? I I would like to see you know take all of the
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:31.820]   of the conversation on reddit and this is a guy at dimler in in germany who said this would be taking all the conversations that read it and
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.740]   um
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:39.500]   Huffington post on the guardian and bright part and and and stick them into watson or into google's ai
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:45.180]   And say give me the patterns and show me where these distortions are you know, you can have a disagreement
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.220]   You know how many coats of shellacs should you put on wood?
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:52.380]   But to have a politically motivated controversy
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.740]   Created controversy is climate change real
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:03.260]   Right are different things and you've got to treat them differently because one is being warped and manipulated and they and they don't kind of
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:07.340]   Admit that so I think they've got to also be more transparent about the manipulation
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:13.020]   To change the focus from the platforms to the manipulators the problem now is everybody says oh, it's your fault google
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:18.460]   It's your fault facebook ignoring the guy the bad guys right? We're doing this blame the mess and show the yeah
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:23.260]   They literally and they got to focus more on who's doing this and why
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.220]   And and I think the platforms have to be able to say
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.940]   Here's their tricks folks. Here's how they're trying to manipulate you. Here's how they're trying to use us
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.860]   Now that's you know risky for them. It makes them seem less than all powerful
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.740]   But right now they shouldn't want to see them all powerful. They shouldn't want to see them human
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.780]   Yeah using these tricks to manipulate us
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:44.220]   To think they're human
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:50.140]   Maybe I'm just now cynical now and I don't I don't I've but you know me. I've never liked PR
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.540]   I've never gone to I do vendor meetings. I don't do talk to PR people
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:59.420]   I don't like to be spun and I'm allergic to the to the point where I actually
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.740]   It you know, I mean everybody else in my in my profession
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:08.300]   Does that I won't yeah, I don't and I respect you for it
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:13.020]   Well, but you know, maybe it I mean there's a side effect. I guess that you become less important
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.420]   Um
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:20.620]   But I guess there are there are there are good and nice PR people who indeed try to get you to the right person
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.300]   To the facts. Yeah, but I think I can do most of that without their help
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:30.780]   Yeah, I don't know. I know we're trying. Yeah, go ahead. Stace. Sorry. No, no, I'm I'm listening to you guys
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.300]   I'm thinking about this going forward. Hey, what do you do?
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:41.660]   Well, I do I do talk to PR people. Yeah, um, I am acutely aware of being spun
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.660]   I would also say that most people in
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.980]   Yes, everyone is going to try to manipulate you all the time
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.180]   And you have to be aware of that and you have to be a bit cynical
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:58.620]   And I think that comes with critical thinking and something that we don't emphasize in school
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.380]   Amen
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:05.260]   Amen, that's the key. That's what Emily is saying in our chat room. We need to course and how to be a true skeptic
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:11.820]   My my my daughter actually her school they're teaching them that but I just I was on okay. I'm I love
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:16.860]   Fashion and beauty sites. So I was reading about like there was this story on like the cut
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:21.100]   It's like should you use under eye cream and the writer was like, I thought you should never use it
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:26.540]   And I was like, oh my god. I don't use under eye cream. I thought it was silly too. Actually, I do
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:32.540]   Maybe you saw that ad on facebook the chinese guy or the big bags and they went away. Yeah, yeah
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:35.580]   So this is a legit story or this is I mean
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.660]   This was positioned as a legit story
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:43.020]   And then her quote was from a dermatologist working for the oil of ole
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.580]   And I was like
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.780]   Oh
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.100]   Really? Yeah, so I mean like
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.380]   But you could say that because you had the fact
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:57.740]   That he was being paid by oil. Vole often that's not communicative. Not said. Yes
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:01.900]   Well, no, that was that was a legitimate article in grated, you know beauty magazines
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.860]   Calling their articles legitimate as a little iffy
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:09.180]   But I mean that was not an ad that was
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.060]   Journalism. Yeah, that's an ad
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:15.420]   Uh, we talked about that with tim whoo, you know
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:20.860]   I love this there was the word halitosis didn't exist until listerine
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.740]   invented it
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.380]   People did not brush their teeth
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:30.060]   until a claud hopkins
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.740]   Created the the notion that you you need to brush your teeth with some gritty substance aka
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.180]   Pepsident
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.660]   In the thirties people didn't brush their teeth before then he invented brushing their teeth
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:48.860]   Can you imagine know how yucky your mouth felt all the time? Yeah, that's the ad. It said run your tongue along your teeth is feel that film
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.580]   That's line
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:57.100]   And then with listerine they actually had a woman who was always the brides may never the bride
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.100]   That's where their phrase comes from
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.980]   Because she had halitosis
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:06.780]   There's really I mean this is stuff. It's it seeped into our consciousness
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:12.540]   We still he points out talk about the Cadillac health plan even though Cadillac II today is probably not
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.860]   You know by most if you ask the 25 year old, what's the best car out there?
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.100]   To be the tesla. Yeah, they're not gonna say Cadillac
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.700]   but that
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.700]   But Cadillac because of
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.020]   And there was no such thing as brand advertising
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:30.620]   Until the 40s or 50s but at that time it was so effective coca-cola Cadillac and a bunch of other brands
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:38.140]   Became burnt into our national psyche the point where Cadillac is now an adjective used to describe something that's really the top of the line
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.500]   What's challenging is though the the
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:51.260]   Market for advertising has changed so utterly. I mean we went through the you know sponsored tv shows to like 30 second ads to big
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:59.900]   Glossy magazine things which actually are still sold today. I saw in my new yorker the google search terms are like many fold page ads
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.220]   but
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:08.620]   With social media with the like segmentation of the audience. It's becoming really interesting to see how advertisers
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:13.340]   I guess create these mass culture phenomenons or even if they can
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:17.740]   Well, that's okay. So that does play into how
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:25.820]   The trump campaign and I think from now on every other campaign political or advertising is going to handle this
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:30.460]   They did highly specialized niche advertising
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:35.980]   And they were able to do so because they're the company Cambridge Analytica, which they hired a british company
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:40.060]   Had administered ever take a facebook quiz
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:47.980]   A lot of them come from Cambridge Analytica and the quiz, you know, which which game of thrones character or you is not about that quiz
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:50.060]   It gets vastly re-shared
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:56.780]   It's about gathering information about you and they've done so over such a long period of time using all sorts of techniques like facebook quizzes
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.180]   that they can very easily
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:06.060]   Breakdown facebook users not into just demographics and economics and age and gender
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.820]   But into are you a depressive type? Are you a happy go lucky type?
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:14.940]   What's the manipulation what message would appeal to you and as the as an example
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.300]   uh
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:23.420]   If they want to do so so in other words many of trump's advertisements were not targeted
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.820]   Were targeted very cleverly with some of them for instance were about voter suppression
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:33.420]   To discourage you from voting if you were going to not going to vote for uh, Donald trump some of them were
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:39.100]   Uh, so let's say we know we want to get a trump voter who's in favor of gun control, but that's not all
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.940]   some people
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:44.940]   Uh are more uh scared types. So we're going to use you know
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.140]   Crime is up 45 percent
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:53.900]   Line to get to them some people are libertarians. They want to preserve their rights
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:59.820]   So we're using a different add to them and all of this dark advertising was facilitated by this incredible
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:06.060]   Platform the facebook is to target micro target and most of us never saw any of those ads
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:12.060]   You know and so it's I mean this is happening already and and the the key is
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:15.660]   And that's why i'm a little worried about this mark succub video
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.220]   I think we're going to start seeing this in spades
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:25.020]   Well, there are two challenges there one is if not everybody sees it it becomes much harder for like journalists to check it
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:29.340]   Right fact I get it and dispute it, but two it's advertising to you
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:35.100]   Specifically based on a personality type and it's designed to manipulate you at a much deeper level
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.860]   Exactly
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:40.380]   And so how it toasts is and you're never going to get married because you have bad breath
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:43.900]   Is is a punters game compared to what they're doing now
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.620]   But but but okay, but but here's here's the argument right
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:51.740]   Um, and I don't always agree with this but but the argument is we in media are storytellers
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.900]   And I actually think we're fact
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:53:00.300]   Delivers but but fine. I'll all stipulate where storytellers. Why do we say that we say that because we manipulate emotions
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:05.580]   Whereas a movie. I want to see lala land. I was practically getting tears. How was that? Was that good? It's very good. I think it's very good
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:11.740]   I see it. I'm gonna see it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you should it's not my most manly moment to say that but it's it's really good
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.740]   I cry I cry
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:18.540]   This is the dead baby problem jeff every time you want to lose baby
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.220]   No, no the dead baby
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:26.860]   So anytime you want to write a boring policy story or a deep tech story or something you look for the dead baby
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.420]   And it's basically as a journalist
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.980]   I could bring you the most
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:37.820]   Yeah, I bring you the most damning set effects and the perfect example of this is I think it was sara kef in
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:42.540]   Oh, baby. She wrote about like hospitals using some
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.740]   some form of
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.300]   Like bad needles sharing not needle sharing bad
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.100]   I I'll have to go look for it. It was a great story
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:57.100]   Highly investigative would have gotten her nowhere except a small child died because of it and that was her lead
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.580]   and
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.980]   Yeah, if you don't have a dead baby. You don't have a story
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:08.300]   Yeah, I remember when I was a struggle tribun the the management editor would come to the task force where I was briefly the copy editor
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:12.620]   And he would write the headline and say go find go fill in that headline and find me the victim
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:17.820]   Yeah, so we've always done that in media, but we need that otherwise it's abstract
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:21.180]   Well, okay, but but what are we doing? We're manipulating
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:26.540]   We're manipulating this is why so this is why I think journalism as a
[00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:34.300]   We are only as good as our storytelling as the stories we can tell right and I think actually
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:39.900]   What we're seeing is a need for fact checking and a need for analysis that's true
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.380]   But it's probably not journalists that are going to do it
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:46.300]   It's probably more like analysts that are going to do it and you can hate me for saying this
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.220]   But I feel like we need an ethical class of analysts and that actually
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.300]   hopefully
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:58.060]   goes towards people doing niche and hands-on and really in depth kind of journalism as opposed to like
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:01.180]   widespread
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:05.820]   Media that's going to be for like the masses and they're not going to be as informed. I don't know
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.980]   Don't forget the Dunning-Kruger effect
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:15.020]   Why is the Dunning-Kruger effect? Oh, you must know jeff what the Dunning-Kruger effect is
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:21.820]   So somebody in the chat room said well, this is you know, this only fools dumb people. No, in fact
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:24.460]   It fools smart people more
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:30.620]   The intelligent this is the Dunning-Kruger effect a cognitive bias in which people reach erroneous conclusions
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.580]   and make unfortunate choices
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:41.020]   But their incompetence robs them of the meta cognitive ability to realize it. You might think well, that means they're stupid right no intelligent people
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:45.660]   competent people actually
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.980]   Uh
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.380]   Make more mistakes because they think they're widely read
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:54.140]   They think oh no, I'm I'm gathering all the evidence
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:57.020]   And they don't doubt themselves as much
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.260]   Now this actually that's the opposite of the Dunning-Kruger effect where the intelligence
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:07.500]   Falsely assume that others have equal intelligence, which is why being smart beautiful or talented can result in lower self-confidence
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.380]   That's another one, but there is a side effect
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.940]   Maybe I'll call it the Dunning-Kruger
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:19.980]   Corollary that in fact smart people are more just as manipulable in fact in many cases more manipulable
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.020]   Yeah, so go to the next item. Yeah
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:29.900]   Below the Zuckerberg I put up a another link related. Let's go to that. Tell me if you think that's real or or
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.860]   fabricated
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:33.500]   Uh
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:38.940]   On the rundown right below that link bill asks mark bill. Yeah, so take a look at that. Okay. Let's see
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:42.140]   This is in the comments under that post on mark Zuckerberg's
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:44.700]   Oh, it's bill gates. Hey mark
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:49.980]   Can Jarvis secretly order a hamburger habit delivered to the back door asking for a friend
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.580]   Wow and bill says Zuckerberg responds mark says I think I can build that for you bill
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.500]   so
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:04.220]   Is this actually bill and mark having a conversation? This is to PR people having a conversation. I doubt it. Oh, uh, what do you think maybe?
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:08.220]   It's got to be approved about hopefully it's approved by each of them
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.940]   Hmm
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:14.220]   Maybe it's bill. I could see bill using it. Here's both that blue check marks
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:21.020]   So I think bills people talk to marks people probably but maybe not you know bill gates is a human being he might
[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:24.780]   I could see that's what i'm saying. I could see it. No, we don't know when you're reading this see skeptical
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:28.620]   The problem with being skeptical is you don't believe anything anymore. That's what i'm saying
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.700]   No world loses all of its magic
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.900]   Well, here's the other thing i've i've i've been in positions where you know
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.580]   We get a grant and we got a right to press release and I end up having to write the press release because I can write
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.980]   So what do you would do I make up quotes for everybody else? They approve them. I could I make them up
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:48.060]   I was just we do oh no I do that too. We you have to do exactly. There's nobody wants to write their own quotes
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:52.140]   Exactly. So that's that's a lie. Hey, is it okay if I say this for you?
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:57.260]   Television b-roll is a lie television naddies are are a lie
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.780]   uh
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.780]   You know we we
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.140]   The person is not really typing anything they're typing to make the the camera happy
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:09.980]   What's the walking down that hole? What's a naughty a naughty is the response shot so that
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:11.980]   I'll just
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:17.420]   Ooh if you only have one camera and you're doing an interview you turn it around the first part of the interview
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:22.780]   You just record all the answers. Maybe you get the the got back of the anchor's head
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.900]   But but mostly you just recording the interviewee
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:31.580]   Then the interviewee leaves the camera goes around to the other side and you nod
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:35.580]   You may re-ask the questions, but also you might you go
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:40.060]   But it's also this horribly awkward thing for the interviewee because
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:45.100]   Just to do so you're talking to the person but the person can't respond all they can do is not at you
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:51.340]   Well, but what it's used for most importantly is if you want to edit the response of the interviewee
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:55.100]   You if you just cut it you'd have a jump cut people would know you edited it
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:59:00.300]   So what you do is a wonderful thing right youtube youtube made the jump cut acceptable
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:05.980]   Thank god for more honest way and maybe maybe a tv but what what I always do is I cut to me going
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.900]   And then you can surreptitiously chop some words out
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:14.220]   It's a terrible business all lies leo terrible lies
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.300]   I actually in living a living reaction
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:23.660]   And of course being in reaction to something is also probably not a healthy thing
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:30.700]   But to it totally exists as a living reaction to years of doing that kind of stuff
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:33.820]   Uh, you know, that's why we're live to tape
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:39.020]   Uh, in fact when we started doing a tech tv I said we're not going to edit out the computer crashes because
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:44.380]   Tech shows up to then everybody everything worked perfectly and it looked like it was so easy to do
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:51.020]   So stupid, I thought this is such a disservice to viewers who it doesn't work that way for them
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.940]   Yeah, it's a really good point
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:58.700]   And and so a lot of what we do and when i don't talk to pr people I don't accept loners
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.020]   All of that stuff you don't do
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.700]   uh
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.540]   Jungkits bargoes
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.700]   Don't do nda's or embargoes
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.020]   And and by the way, I'm not knocking people who have to do that
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.460]   There's a lot of reasons why you have to do that not everybody can afford to buy everything
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:17.900]   Uh, in fact we do often we used to we had a review show we took loners because it wasn't just me it was other people
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:22.140]   Um, so we took you know, we're loan units and we always I had strict rules about it
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.140]   We always send them back and all that stuff
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.140]   um, but uh, you know
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:33.020]   I've it's a luxury but I and so I understand when people you fear in a print print journalist and you get lead time
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.260]   You have to do nda's and embargoes and all that stuff
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.980]   Well, so last week last tuesday
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.900]   I under embargo
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:44.940]   Her everything facebook was going to do in their changes last week. Yeah, I sit on the show and I
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:50.620]   Right because I knew it wasn't gonna be after thursday noon. I know I remember that I can write the post
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:54.300]   Yep, but you know, so i'm thursday noon. I published what's what I wrote
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:01:00.140]   Uh, 36 hours before and I didn't say anything on the show because I respect interference of the deal. It's the deal fun
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.900]   Um
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.900]   But yeah, it makes you feel a little odd
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:08.460]   Yep, I am constantly under embargoes. So it becomes really
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.660]   Really challenging sometimes especially
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.980]   Because i'm under embargo in my podcast comes out tomorrow morning
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:22.220]   So there are things I can talk about there that I can't talk about. Oh, that's fine here. That's okay. I'm like, oh, we understand that
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.260]   So we understand that
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:29.660]   But but then really a lot of the reason I don't do is because I don't I don't it's uncomfortable to be in that position
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:32.780]   Well, it is your wife's your wife's and i can't i can't do it
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.580]   No, I've only only once in my life
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:39.500]   I think if I broke an nda or an embargo was totally of course in in in adverton
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.980]   Elisa yelled at me once
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:46.780]   Smiling and just said don't tell him anything. He's not supposed to say no don't do that
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:51.340]   not because I uh, I can keep a secret but because uh
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:55.020]   I prefer not to I don't like to be put in that position
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.860]   Well, you never have to worry then what you know, you know, you know, you can say I could say anything I know
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:01.980]   And things you don't know
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.980]   Mostly that's what I say high five Jeff
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.980]   Oh
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:11.100]   Oh, I can't do this I can't do
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:19.420]   Jeff and stacy can't figure out cameras fist bump fist bump is a lot easier stacy. There we go
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.420]   Uh, that was more of a pirate thing
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:30.860]   The year in search
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:34.700]   Instead of doing what happened to zeitgeist members google had this great
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.660]   Yeah, they shaped because they use that brand for their conference right
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:42.140]   So now they make a video a huge and I never get invited to uh
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.940]   The conference or the video
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.940]   These are
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:49.980]   These are the new these are the full page ads in the new yorker. They're very nice
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:53.900]   I was very puzzled though. They don't even say the thing in the video. I don't I haven't seen it
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.660]   Yeah, it's a picture. It's a pictures. It's like a still from the vision. Should we watch it?

[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:09.100]   The uncertainty all the facts that you don't know what's gonna happen. You're a more divided nation than we've ever
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.100]   The year in search
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:15.340]   So that was next to us. He ran toward the shaft people start screaming everybody gets on the floor
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.500]   It's completely tragedy. It's amazing

[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:23.100]   This is kind of like the youtube
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:30.060]   We are the music well so the idea is we search for the things that these are people we search for juice

[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.860]   I
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:26.140]   Can't get upset over that. I mean any of these things are basically advertisements

[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:27.580]   Was on the bbc but i think probably big because of its appearance of the third season on netflix

[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:40.140]   Okay, you know one thing that bothered me here's a trend that's bothered me and i got bit by it yesterday
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:43.260]   Uh, we might have all gotten bit by it
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:48.300]   It's a it's a new kind of fake news on facebook. It's not fake news. It's just old news
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.620]   Yeah, oh, yeah, well that happens. Yeah a lot. Yep
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:58.860]   So yesterday everybody I know on facebook posted this thing that the last night was the darkest night of the year
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:01.580]   It was a article from 2010
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:04.860]   And I said it I went last night
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.580]   Yeah, so
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.900]   It was the winter solstice in 2010
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.100]   Coincided with a full moon and a total lunar eclipse
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:17.980]   So it was the darkest year since you know 1684
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:22.860]   But that was 2010 for some reason everybody all at once posted it
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:28.860]   And it became the thing on facebook yesterday even though it wasn't true. It was just old
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.900]   And then i'll think that that's some bad guys
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.220]   Yes, thank you for debunking that cnn then I felt like an idiot
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:40.780]   I mentioned it on security now and then I I realized and I immediately retracted it, but it was too late
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:43.340]   already sent it
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.980]   What does that happen?
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.100]   I think um
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:54.140]   Go ahead. I was gonna say someone picks it up somewhere and shares it. I mean that that's
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:14:00.700]   Probably innocent. I would think yeah, the easiest fact checking you can do. Yeah, look at the date
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:05.180]   Some places don't put the dates
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:07.180]   Right, so we absolutely bonkers
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.580]   Okay, I'm very passionate about that
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:13.420]   I actually had a fight when I started while my sites when I was working in advance
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:15.500]   They wanted to put the date on the home page
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.020]   And I said no, you know what day it is put on the story fine
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:23.180]   Yeah, no story. I got I did two bad retweet state. That was one
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:28.220]   The other one I did was the guy who was supposedly kicked off a delta flight
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:32.540]   For speaking on the phone and his mother in Arabic
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:35.340]   Yeah big video all kinds of things
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:43.020]   And so I you know all plebasses when people had trusted passed it along and I passed it along and then bingo. He's um
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:47.260]   A notorious prankster. Yeah, he's done all kinds of other things
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:51.660]   So and some people are trying to say well it still reveals things. Well, no, it seems like entrapment
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:57.100]   And and he was this was fake news. He was he was pranky. He was he was manipulating us
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.900]   purposefully
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.380]   And that's so that means the definition of fake news
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:08.220]   You want to be like you remember and apparently she is real but the seven-year-old girl in Aleppo
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:10.300]   Who was tweeting?
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:14.060]   I read all of those stories and I think even the times had a story on it. I was like this
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:16.220]   feels
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.140]   Too good to be true and not too good
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.860]   But like too good of a story to be true and I was like
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:27.020]   Just and I couldn't trust anyone and I didn't retweet any of these stories because I was like no way no way
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:30.140]   and now I now
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.100]   Yes, she's out the world's a good place, you know
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:39.100]   The world's still a terrible place, but whatever but yes like you totally doubt yourself now in
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:43.420]   The alternative is to sit back on these things and not feel like you're part of a conversation
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:47.020]   Which is terrible for social people like us, but that is you're absolutely right
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.420]   So so some important fact checkers
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.300]   Did track down and did go to the effort to confirm
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:57.020]   Though there was some caution you didn't want to publish that too much and publish too much information about her
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:03.260]   But so so she turned out to be by all accounts now real however, then she appears on erudewon's lap
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:06.700]   uh, delivery in a scripted line. Oh dear
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:12.380]   It couldn't be more manipulative with erudewon. It just makes you feel like the dirtiest Santa Claus around. Oh dear
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:16.620]   You know and and so anything gets used and corrupted
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:24.940]   You watch the scene it's like she's a hostage having to say the sentence. No correct me if i'm wrong
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:29.020]   I'll never mind. I don't want to get into it
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.580]   uh
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.580]   But that's why I see fake news is
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:40.060]   Limiting fake news is being somewhat of a problem. Maybe if you do it right though that prevents this kind of thing from getting repeated like
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.540]   Uh leo did you notice that was 2010?
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:49.660]   I did that like an april fools. Oh, I think it was an april fools joke from a long time ago about like the mars rover being sad
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:52.620]   No, that was he actually the mars rotor actually tweeted
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:57.420]   But they know it was a fake twitter account from the mars rover. Well, but but leo this is key
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.580]   This is key to what facebook is doing
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:05.100]   Right so facebook is giving you more information at two important points when you want to read and when you want to share
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:10.140]   It would actually fix that wouldn't it it would fix it because all you have to see is oh a hundred of your friends have said oops
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:14.620]   And you'd say oh, thank you for sharing for sparing me this embarrassment
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:20.060]   Um, not other people want to share it anyway. That's fun. That's their right to do and they can be wrong, but I want to be right
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:22.860]   I think most people want to be right
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:27.580]   Well, yeah, I think we want to be we want to be considered
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:29.980]   So we want to be considered an expert
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:36.940]   So we want to be right and then we want to share that with people and we also want to talk to people about things that we see and that's
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:42.060]   Well, what's changed? It's the same thing i talked about last week is that if you had done that at the office
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:45.100]   And said oh did you see this?
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:51.900]   And then later you realize it was fake no harm no foul then but that satisfies that sharing thing the problem with twitter is
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:56.540]   It is both the office water cooler and a permanent record of your stupidity
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:01.020]   Well, facebook to me any the internet the internet so not twitter
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.940]   Don't
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:09.980]   What that's what twitter is I well no, I mean, it's what the internet is yeah, but twitter feels more casual
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:12.700]   I think twitter is a little worse in facebook because it's a little more
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:17.500]   It just kind of lends itself to really off the cuff stuff. Yeah and fast and fast
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:22.700]   I won't honey. You can have your twitter addiction. That's okay
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.820]   Did you just call me honey? I did
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:30.940]   Unfollowed jites see now if I had tweeted that that would have lived forever
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:34.540]   But instead I did on a podcast that no one listens to so there you go
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:41.580]   Who was it who someone tweeted? I thought this was hilarious nothing is as secret as the last thing someone says on a podcast
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:46.940]   And I was like, yes, that's really true. That's why we save our ads for the end. Yeah, no way to make that small
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:50.700]   No, oh, dude. What time is it? Do we need an ad? Yes
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:55.100]   Thank you. You're gonna lose smoother than that usually
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:57.980]   I
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.540]   I'm sorry. I called you honey. I don't know what happened what came over me
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:06.380]   It was the hat. It was joking. I'm gonna blame the hat and I will never wear it. It was joking. It was just I call him honey too
[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:12.460]   It's okay. Sweetie. Sweetie boobla. I'll call you schmopie schmopie
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:19.100]   Schmopie. I like what's that? I like schmopie. I don't know. It's got a sign called reference. That's a sign
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:25.980]   Where did it come from in my brain? Jerry Jerry disgusted everybody else because he called his girlfriend schmopie
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:30.940]   Let's see if we can fight like that. Let's try

[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:25.340]   Oh lord

[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:39.660]   Nothing's worse than calling out somebody and then having them apologize a whole bunch of times
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.940]   So you feel really so conscious about it and be calling to subject
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:48.700]   Like shmopie go by the way Seinfeld always had a different girlfriend every episode right?

[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:18.940]   I
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.540]   I've met tom weiler
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:25.660]   I've read his books because I had to beat him or I met him so I read stuff before it
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:31.900]   This man is a class act and for all of the media and we were like oh my gosh. He's a lobbyist
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.980]   You know he worked for cpa
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:35.740]   I
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:38.540]   this man when he hired gg from uh
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:41.740]   Public knowledge
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:45.500]   gg sewn. I was like oh he's just putting out a you know
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:51.980]   Blanketing over like his his policies. She's going to be like his front man for like what's it called?
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.860]   Papering over papering over and by golly
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:25:01.500]   This man was amazing for the consumer when it came to the internet and broadband access
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.260]   And principles yes
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:05.100]   Yes, so good
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:11.660]   And I really like I was so deeply disappointed in julius jennie koski when you know, I was I had some high hopes for him
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.660]   And I was like yeah, he was uh
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:16.460]   Bama
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:21.340]   Uh campaign guy in fact we interviewed him during the 2008 election. I haven't had him sit with me for a little bit
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:23.740]   Uh during our election coverage
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:26.060]   And he was a great guy
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:31.180]   And who very in that literate and he turned out not to be such a great fcc chairman. It just showed you a poth issue
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.180]   No
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.180]   I think it actually helps like
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:40.140]   Julius had ideas, but he was a terrible politician. He was so wimpy and
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:43.260]   But tom wheeler
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:47.820]   He had a plan. He knew how to play the polity political game and boom. He did now
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:51.180]   His he's resigned so his remaining
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:55.260]   Remember his plan to tear apart net neutrality as quickly as possible
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:58.780]   But all right, I'm going to just say this once
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.980]   Look, we thought tom wheeler was going to be exactly, you know, the dingo
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.700]   Was it isn't that what uh
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:08.860]   John Stewart or uh
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.700]   No john all over. Oh
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:18.060]   He said it's like putting it putting the fc the uh the uh net neutrality in tom wheeler's hands like having a dingo baby sit your baby
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:24.700]   And uh and john all of her retracted it and apologized. I apologize because I thought the same thing
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:29.580]   Sometimes a guy gets in office realizes how important what he is is doing
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:32.780]   Maybe heres other people other points of view and turns out
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:39.580]   Oh, pileana mr. pileana swede. Yeah, schmoopy. Call me schmoopy. Yeah, schmoopy. Yeah
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:45.900]   Uh, this is not the character of the people these people have already said what they're going to do they're going to kill net neutrality
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.060]   I'm just praying. It's not true
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.820]   schmoopy
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:53.020]   Remaining sse commissioners the one's already in power
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:58.780]   Exactly. Oh, this is great. We got rid of we got two people gone. We're gonna have two more seats
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.860]   And we're getting rid as soon as we can. This is it on net neutrality
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:09.260]   What is okay? So there must be have to get democratic chairs. They have to have two democratic and two republican chairs
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:10.940]   And so what i'll have
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:14.940]   Is our commissioner. Sorry, and then the chair is going to be republican. So it's going to be a three two
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.980]   um
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:20.140]   Well, republicans now have a two to one majority
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:25.260]   Right, right now. But you're right. There's one republican and one democrat, but that doesn't i don't think look that
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.900]   There's one thing we've learned is this is no longer breaking down on party lines particularly
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:36.620]   I'm sure you could find a democrat who doesn't want net neutrality either. Yeah, what about that john ledger guy?
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:44.860]   So here's here's a technological solution may not happen, but let's let's walk with stacey down polyanelane
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:50.780]   The reason we need net neutrality is because we have with you smirpy i'm holding your hand. Let's go
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:57.020]   We have terrible broadband competition in this country if we had good competition
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:01.900]   Net neutrality becomes less important. Right. I people hate when I say that but it's true
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:04.060]   uh
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.860]   So we now have because of some of the actions
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:13.020]   But of this fcc and some of the investments that google and facebook and others are making in wireless gigabit broadband
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:15.420]   It's conceivable that we could have
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:20.300]   Real broadband in only urban areas though and that's where my analogy breaks down
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:25.580]   So who's going to be screwed people in middle america who voted for trump overwhelmingly
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:31.660]   Um, yeah, true same with health, but we don't talk about politics
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:36.220]   Well when the intersection of net neutrality in politics, um
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:39.340]   You know, there are those people there are many people in fact
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:45.660]   We have a regular in our chatroom and on our shows who is an internet service provider in yoming
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:51.740]   I think or montana somewhere in the midwest. He's a wireless internet service provider, uh, brek brad. Yeah. Oh
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:55.180]   Hi, brad
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:58.220]   I call him schmuppy
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:03.180]   Brett brad does dead said against net neutrality. He said it. Yes. He is. Yeah
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:07.340]   And he's an i s google so the reason brad is
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:10.220]   Okay
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.060]   I haven't talked to brad. You don't have to speak for him
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:15.740]   We've had him on and we've had him talk about it over and over again. So
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.300]   uh, he and I did because he has a
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:22.860]   I think an informed point of view about why net neutrality is no good
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.740]   um in any events
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:31.020]   He's stuck on a wireless isp he has to buy his backhaul from the carriers which
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:33.260]   right
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:37.500]   And this fcc was actually dealing with an issue near and dear to brad's heart
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:41.980]   Which was special access and I guarantee you that special access is not going to come
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:43.180]   up again
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.740]   So that's a shame because it's a big deal
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:48.220]   but
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:54.860]   But no one cares about special access because it's so boring. What is special access special access is
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:58.140]   carriers so
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:01.180]   To buy backhaul to the public internet if you're in a remote place
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:03.500]   You actually have to buy circuits from
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:10.140]   Verizon or at and t the big company sprint who own those circuits wherever the incumbent in that area is right
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:17.980]   Yes, and there's the pricing of those is set by those companies and so it can be very expensive
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:22.540]   for not just small isp's like brad, but also
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:26.860]   Carriers like t-mobile so t-mobile has to spend a lot of money on
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:30.860]   They basically pay verizon when you make calls in rural areas
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:37.420]   So that is special access and that the issue there is should the fcc regulate this because it is
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:43.180]   Another situation where there's kind of a monopoly because of the equipment and infrastructure
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:48.220]   So now you know about special access. Yeah
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:53.100]   Yeah, and I always told I always said to Brett well you weren't in an unusual situation
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:56.540]   I don't think that that necessarily means net neutrality is a bad idea
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:59.820]   By the way, the guy we interviewed on monday coin the term net neutrality
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:04.060]   Yeah in a paper in 2006 called net neutrality and broadband discrimination
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:07.580]   And I wish everybody glummed on to broadband discrimination
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:13.900]   Instead of net neutrality because net neutrality is too hard to explain to people, but everybody understands like saying google
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.700]   Yeah, it's hard to say, you know
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:21.980]   Not okay google. I'm sorry
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:26.620]   My phone woke up
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:32.940]   I'm sorry if I woke up your phone tree loving family turns down page and pals seven million bucks
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:35.740]   one acre of land
[01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:40.540]   For $10 million it seems there's something google can't buy bag or steal a small piece of land
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:43.660]   Right in the heart of silicon valley right in the campus
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:48.700]   The martinelli family owns a one acre lot tech giant has offered them seven
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:55.660]   Million is this a real picture or is this a fake? No, no, that's really that's from the car. That's up blue. That's uh, right? Okay
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:59.260]   Because I love it. It's a house
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:01.820]   Being surrounded. Yeah
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:07.180]   Part of this they've no picture of the lot but they say the lot has like like old used cars on it
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:10.700]   I love the google campus being around this this bit of
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:16.380]   I'm old enough and I've been here long enough to remember that silicon valley was prune orchards
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:19.660]   This was farmland before it was praised
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:25.420]   Yeah prunes prune orchard in fact that these the apple martinellis. Oh, I wonder
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:27.340]   I
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:32.700]   Was like orchards martinellis. I know I don't think so I doubt it
[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.900]   But yeah
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:37.420]   They don't live there their father bought the land in the 1940s
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:41.580]   And the family remembers picking fruit playing on a tractor
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:45.180]   Uh letter martinelli says we don't need the money
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:49.100]   So maybe it is because he's heir to the sparkling cider fortune. I don't know
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:53.820]   Right now it's not for sale
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:57.180]   Uh, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same martinellis
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:00.300]   I'm very curious about that
[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:04.460]   The average price for an acre of farmland in the us three thousand dollars
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:10.940]   Uh, california is the most expensive eight month expensive state the typical land
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:14.780]   Price for an acre is 39,000 undeveloped
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:17.740]   Most expensive is new jersey jeff
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.820]   mm-hmm
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:21.980]   196 000 per acre
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:25.820]   on uh, which exit are you on?
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:28.060]   33
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:30.060]   That's for
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:37.580]   You know, I know that now I know that because I went we went to vegas for my birthday last week and we saw the magician david copperfield
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:41.660]   whose real name is david cotkin and he grew up in matuchin
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:44.460]   Oh, and uh
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.700]   You know, he uses the audience a lot and
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:50.620]   Asked lady where she's from she says new jersey. He says what exit are you from?
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.180]   She's 48 and she he says I'm 10
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:58.700]   That was cute. Yeah, apparently that's what jerseyites do. That's right
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:05.740]   Anyway, uh, nothing more to say here except uh, I bet you they don't I bet you the goog doesn't stop at seven million
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:11.900]   Well, I'm sure that's what they're betting too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you think that's really what's going on
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:18.700]   I love an apple orchard as much as the next person, but at a certain point in time goog's gonna win in
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:25.420]   That's not a nice thing to say what happens. They go to the city government and they use them in the domain. That's what happens
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:27.500]   Yeah, you you figure out a way to
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.980]   Get what you need
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:37.980]   Oh, we're all terrible and cynical. I should I should burn my say and I have I am not worthy you guys. This is our christmas show. Geez
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:40.780]   That is our darkest show yet
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:46.220]   German law wants to find social media sites for publishing fake news that'll work
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:55.260]   Yeah, so we have we have my european stories. We have the germans threatening to do this 500,000 per episode which they're
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:35:02.620]   Uh, they're going after the wrong party. They're making again as I said earlier. They're making the platforms the bad guy not the creator of this
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:06.460]   Did you read this story? I I really enjoyed this. I think was it the times
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:08.620]   uh about
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:11.740]   The kind of weird remember there was a spay in fact it even
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:17.260]   Happened to me. I think lisa came in. Did you say did you see the tomhanks is moving to petaluma?
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:23.340]   Oh, it was on buzzfeed. It's a great story. Yes, right. Oh, yeah, it's great great silverman's been doing such a good job
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:25.820]   Yeah, he's the best tracking down
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:29.900]   Uh these fake news sites. So apparently there's this
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:33.260]   I don't is it him? Is it this guy or what?
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:37.180]   There's a guy who owns a lot of
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:41.020]   fake news sites, but he's got this very interesting kind of
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.580]   retail approach to fake news
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:48.220]   And they were creating posts that celebrities had moved
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:52.700]   To i'm trying to find it here on uh to your town
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:59.180]   And they're very effective, but they're kind of they're not they're obviously not shared globally
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:03.020]   They're shaded shared, you know, that's that story was everybody in petaluma shared it
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:06.060]   Tom hanks is moving here
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:12.060]   Why is he doesn't like every town? The earth milton canes everywhere
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.500]   um
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:21.580]   Yes, but then and then and then they're getting even less so what's interesting because it's kind of retail
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:24.460]   viral
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:27.340]   Um, they're getting and they're getting weirder and weirder like um
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:30.300]   like
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:36.380]   Let me see if I can find it cleveland snopes daily news. I want to find the buzzfeed article because it's really good
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:39.420]   tomhanks moving buzzfeed
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:42.860]   And craig silverman who's been doing?
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:50.700]   Of course the problem with the search for buzzfeed i'm also getting which tomhanks character are you the slow fade of tomhanks
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:56.300]   Can you name these tomhanks characters the luckiest couple that ever got photobombed by tomhanks?
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:37:04.940]   Uh the the true story behind the biggest fake news hit of the election is the headline fake news hit of the
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:07.820]   election that should be enough
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.820]   Yeah, um so
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:16.780]   Why is brad pit moving to pittsburgh california?
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:21.900]   This is the same guy who did the pope endorses donald trump by the way
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:25.980]   But he's actually i think probably doing pretty well with these little
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:28.140]   kind of mini
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:38.060]   viral stories and all the sites have legitimate sounding names like kspm 33.com and ky6news.com and km8news.com
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:41.420]   Those are not those do not sound like legitimate
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:44.940]   Really they sound like bad local tv stations
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:50.300]   Well, but it's not the right format, but I guess you're right they for people who don't know that that's
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:53.260]   You look at a flash, right?
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:57.100]   You see a bc.com whatever and you right?
[01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:01.500]   Um, this is where we're john borthwick and i and r in our solutions
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:05.020]   post suggested that they've got to do a far better job of kind of
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:09.900]   Of giving you more information to get about the source how old is this source? How long is this source been around?
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:12.300]   uh, there's signals that can give you a
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.420]   To help you find the bs
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:19.420]   They have of course the guy has a google ad sense in all of these
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:22.140]   websites and it's the same id
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:28.060]   And they were able to track it down really did their bus feeds doing some great journalism
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:32.700]   They think and i i'm going to say allegedly because a guy denies it
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:35.580]   uh to uh
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:39.500]   A guy who lives in atas coderro california just up north here
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:42.780]   named joustin stimps is it smithson
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:44.860]   He's a
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:49.100]   commercial pilot works for charter airline and s l o he's uh in his 30s
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.780]   over the years he's registered and launched many websites
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:57.100]   And it's this google ad sense id is associated with him
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.740]   And it's on everywhere
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:04.940]   And he has registered everything from jennifer love huett picks to fox business dot x y z
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:11.340]   To alex jones dot x y z it probably makes a pretty little penny now bus feed went to his house
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:19.020]   Hmm with a camera crew two men were on the front porch of the home when we arrived when they saw us approaching with camera and they went inside
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:23.740]   We called out to say we wanted to talk to joustin one of the men yelled from a window
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:29.180]   There wasn't anyone here by that name. He threatened to break our camera. So we left
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:34.940]   Uh, then they continue to email they have not been able to track him down
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.020]   He they did get an email
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:43.340]   Statement from smithson. I do not own those websites. You did not visit my house and I did not threaten to break your camera
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:46.060]   I've never seen you at my house. I've never seen you anywhere
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:51.500]   Your article is entirely defamatory and i'm sending you this one request to immediately remove it
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:57.260]   Well, they didn't obviously the ad sense id is not mine. He says I use that id on test websites
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:03.740]   It was essentially a throw away id I borrowed from someone else. You know, that may not be uh completely impossible
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:07.340]   I wouldn't be surprised if ideas float around and read it in other places
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:11.740]   Just you know because you don't want to do something that gets you in trouble and that gets your account banned
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:18.140]   Uh, he says I do not have access to the idea of not for some time and i'm not responsible for what someone else has used it for
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:21.100]   So it may well be that he didn't do it
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:26.940]   I to be completely fair to him, but uh, it's really interesting
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:29.980]   um
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:36.540]   That there i mean it's it shows you the fake news is a deeper story than just uh political
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:44.460]   Right. Oh, yeah, politics economic so the trump the trump election was our dead baby for getting excited about. Yeah, yes
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:49.100]   Um back to the show title dead babies. No, sorry
[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:51.900]   Schmubey
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:53.900]   Schmubey is that a dead baby in your lead?
[01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:59.740]   Here are some of the other hoaxes just so that you can kind of be aware of these a new star wars film being shot in roswell, new, mexico
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.140]   Um
[01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:06.940]   I mean, it's it's it's really retail. So only people in roswell would be interested in that
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:08.140]   There's a lot of that, you know
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:11.740]   Morgan Freeman is coming to town to shoot his newest movie kind of stuff
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:17.340]   Uh, it's really it's called buzzfeeds calling it the local viral scam
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:24.460]   Because they never go, uh, it's the same as you if you try to search for florist and you know, uh, given town
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:29.820]   You can't find the floor and it's it's the first, you know 30 listings are all for national services
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:33.340]   That's said that by the listings says florist in petaluma
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:36.940]   Look at this stepbrothers sequel to begin filming in sacramento this fall
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:40.220]   Father of the bride three to be filmed in boston the notebook
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:45.260]   But usually they don't do it in big cities because you know it's people in small towns who have that kind of town pride like petaluma
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:49.820]   That they would share that with everybody. Oh my god. So tom hanks moving here
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:53.420]   Lock so when the new york times did a whole thing about
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:58.460]   Uh, oh fake online locksmiths, maybe out to pick your pocket
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:03.500]   So what it was was google so it was back in january so you can read the story
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.420]   um
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:09.500]   A google search for someone to help you when you're locked out pulls up like
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:14.780]   Not a real service. So this was a problem that google had with their search thing
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:19.020]   So this is basically someone gaming fake news just like someone back in the day game
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.740]   Local search
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:28.940]   Um, and if once you see it along these lines then you're like I get it. Oh, but you don't think somebody's gonna make a fake story
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:31.900]   About, uh, you know
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:38.140]   Get in getting a flat tire in muncie, indiana. I mean what why would somebody make that?
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:42.140]   But it was
[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:44.620]   It's so funny
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:47.900]   By the way
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:53.420]   Fake or not according to our chat room. What exit are you from is a joe piscopo?
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:56.060]   Started me of course. He was god help me
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:02.380]   Who might run for governor of jersey the only thing you could imagine worse than chris christie?
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:06.460]   Joe piscopo he's he's just a lump of stupid
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:10.860]   That's a good show title too
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:14.060]   A lump of stupid
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:16.620]   Oh god
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:18.700]   Um, I tell you what
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:26.700]   Do we want is there i'll give you both a chance to uh, talk the yahoo hack talk about anything you want
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:30.940]   You know, there's a lot of stories in here. We don't have to what's new about that. It's every other day
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:31.980]   Yeah, billy
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:36.220]   So it was first half a billion and then there was a second hack that we learned about from 2013
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:39.660]   Well with a billion yahoo accounts been hacked and now
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:41.660]   apparently
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:42.620]   uh
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:46.620]   The uh database is apparently on sale on the dark web
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:49.580]   For about $300,000
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:55.660]   I feel like the people who are using yahoo are probably the most vulnerable. So I feel like they should be priced higher
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:02.620]   Those are prime suckers. That's kind of what I feel. I'm like man who uses yahoo
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:06.620]   um people who believe in nigerian scams
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:11.820]   Or this though. I just want to say really underscores how important
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:15.340]   The first amendment is and a free presses
[01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:25.100]   Because in the in the world with fake news and how important eth journalistic ethics are and how i you're doing god's work jiff jarvus
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:27.580]   teaching a new generation
[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:33.420]   Ethics how to do their job right using modern techniques database analysis and social media
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:37.900]   To do the most important job there is which is to speak truth to power
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:40.780]   To comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:47.980]   And I think that was a marty baren phrase. I think originally. I don't know no no it's an old one HL mankin
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:49.980]   Yeah, yeah, I think so
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:52.860]   Well, it seems like marty baren should have said it
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:45:02.860]   Marty baren started off his commencement speech he followed a wonderful student of ours who gave his talk in english and spanish
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:08.220]   And marty started off answering him in spanish. Oh nice marty's fluent nice
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:13.180]   So as my daughter now and i'm really yeah, how's her yeah her spanish is great now about
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.900]   except
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:19.100]   Kind of unbeknownst to her because she was studying in school
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:25.420]   But she also had a lot of friends spanish mexican friends and she was learning kind of a street market
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:28.700]   and um
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:33.180]   So on her way home we she had to come to mexico city stay at the maria before she went to the flight and
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:37.100]   She used some of that in the maria and it was apparently quite embarrassing
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:39.420]   Really
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:49.420]   Ah, she had no idea and then uh somebody had explained to her. Oh, yeah, what was she saying? Well, you just don't say that in polite company, but there
[01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:51.980]   mexico is interesting
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:58.620]   I think it's there's a real stratification of some classes and as anywhere in england is the same way your accent and how you speak
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:01.900]   Immediately informs people what class you belong to right
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:05.100]   Is that true in the us?
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:09.260]   Well, you could say that there's dialects in the us. I mean if I come in with a
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:15.580]   I don't know if I had a deep southern draw right you'd probably it can you automatically let me
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:21.660]   Someplace which is a big snake. Yeah. No, I I had a boston one of those boston accents
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.140]   I think you are wicked smat
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:26.300]   wicked smat
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:31.100]   Yeah, um, let's see your favorite story of the week
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:34.540]   My favorite story of the week, you know, it was probably
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500]   It's not on here. Um
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:42.460]   You didn't write about my favorite story of the week, which was
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:47.980]   um actually about it was actually a fortune newsletter on
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:51.020]   Amazon it tied to amazon's
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:56.700]   Lack of echoes for the holidays, but also like sold out right yeah in apples
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:47:02.540]   Wireless earbuds so it was basically talking about like what the heck is it with these companies?
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.740]   Could they not anticipate the demand what's happening on the shipment side? That's a question
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:11.900]   I've been asking for a while. I know that's why I was like, oh, it's worth it because it's the holidays. Yeah, so
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:14.620]   I don't know
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:16.620]   You know it's often speculated
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:20.700]   Uh big tech has the supply chain there it is
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:24.860]   Is the story it's often speculated that they do it on purpose
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:32.540]   That apple well it would chiefly have apple that they would do they would have fake shortages at the beginning of the iphone sales cycle to create
[01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:34.540]   lines
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:38.140]   To get publicity right and there certainly was a lot of
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:40.220]   uh
[01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.220]   press
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:46.860]   With the lines, but I always thought god if I were apple, I'd want to sell as many as I could
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:49.580]   As fast as I could I'd make them all
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:53.180]   Um, so I I don't know if I completely believe that
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:48:00.700]   Do maybe maybe if it's not the holidays, but like missing christmas for an expensive gadget. Yeah, it's a big deal
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:04.940]   This is adam laskinski. All right. He's good. Yeah
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:10.140]   Oh, oh
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:11.500]   Oh
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:18.620]   Your editor in you is coming out. Yeah, geez. I'm like, eh santa's very grumpy today
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:21.980]   Yeah
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:23.980]   I'll tell you now. By the way, I
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:27.500]   We know who's on santa's naughty list, don't we by the way
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:33.820]   This is another reason to hate better. Don't if we mention anybody on this show or anywhere in the world
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:38.540]   If you say anything about anybody negative, it's immediately tweeted to that person
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:43.980]   Yeah, it's as if everybody now has a live clipping surface of all media
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:46.860]   You know that's that's not terrible
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:53.100]   No, kid told your feet to the fire. We we have to be a little more uh honest. It's not like i'm operating in obscurity anymore
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:49:00.540]   I wanted more from this story. That's that my a is well the a is where is the where's the where's the beef
[01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:03.180]   Yeah
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:07.740]   Like oh, this is happening. He says all sorts of reasons might explain the shortages
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:11.260]   Tell me
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:14.060]   Could be anything
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:20.220]   Only this is my favorite. You should close it out with this. What's causing the shortages only time will tell
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:27.900]   That's my favorite. That's a tv news closing. That is a tv thing. Yeah, I know all the tv tropes
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:31.420]   I gotta learn those
[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:36.140]   Uh, you're not leaving us for tv. I hope no no they would never let me on tv
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:37.740]   Why not
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:41.900]   Oh, i'm too uncensored. They'd be like whoa god. You don't speak in sound bites and oh no
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:45.660]   No, no, no, I could get you a job in a heartbeat. You want to be you want to do the
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:51.100]   I I oh I could call live with kelly right now and get you a regular tech
[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:54.540]   You bet I used to do I did it for 12 years
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:55.740]   Wow
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:59.020]   Yeah, and I'm finally tired of it because it's a lot of work and I had to fly all the way back
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.660]   But uh you get to go to new york once a month, which is nice
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:07.180]   I do like new york. Yeah, I bought new york once a month for those yeah, I did it for two
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:07.980]   I did it
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:13.660]   You know it's funny. I started it started in uh 2001 right after 9/11 nobody would nobody would go to new york
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:17.420]   And so in november or october of 9/11 of uh
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:21.660]   2011 I did the first one and I kept doing them until regis retired
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:26.460]   Right, uh, so I don't know when that was a few years ago and it was a lot of fun
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:32.140]   But but it's work because you have to get a bunch. So this is what you do stacy you get a bunch of gadgets like 50
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:35.260]   Okay, like a bunch you could be the IOT person
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:42.140]   Get a bunch of them. Okay, and then you bring them all the day before you have to say two-day gig because you have to go the day before
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:47.180]   Line them all up get them working and then gellman the executive producer comes out and goes
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:52.940]   Yeah, no, yeah, huh? Mm-hmm. You know, it'd be really great if you put regis's music on that one. Okay
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:59.020]   And then leaves and then you have to call 48 of the 50 come actually you keep like 20
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.660]   So you call 30 of the 50 companies say you're not gonna make it on your life
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:07.500]   But it does make it easy to get them because you say well, we're gonna be showing this right we might be showing this on live
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.740]   and then
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:13.660]   So then the 20 okay, so you call those 20 say well we again you have to say
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:17.660]   Time permitting you might be on live tomorrow morning
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:22.540]   Then you get up very early in the morning you get it there, you know, because it's live at 9am
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:25.740]   Get very early in the morning. You set them all up got everything working on a table
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:30.140]   Which they roll in the back, you know while on morosa or whoever is doing their thing
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:35.980]   She was a guest on one of mine didn't know who she was but she was a guest on one of the ones
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:40.860]   I if I'd known she was going to be in charge of the new president's reach outreach to uh
[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:43.340]   African-americans. I would have been nicer to her
[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:49.180]   But uh, but she was you know, she was the evil apprentice, right? She was I was about to say she was the bad one villain
[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:53.260]   Uh, Matthew mcconna. Hey, I met a lot of people Steven Tyler
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:56.380]   Uh, anyway, so there's you meet them backstage
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:02.060]   Uh, I tried to take a picture of uh, who's the woman in sex in the city
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:04.480]   Sarah Sarah Jessica
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:06.620]   Right. She was there in her look, you know
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:09.020]   Hi, hi
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:14.860]   Manolo blonics and uh, she gave me the stink. I when I took a picture of her, but anyway, so
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:21.340]   Sometimes do you call her honey? I did sometimes you have getting a lot of trouble
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:26.140]   Because I would take pictures backstage and gelman would we'd say I'd like that film, please
[01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:32.380]   They don't want any, you know, they feel like out. So this was back when film was no, it's no film involved
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:38.220]   I'm like wait a second and then they got the victrola out and we recorded our piece
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:43.980]   Excellent, but you could do this it would be so much fun. You could be the iot girl
[01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:47.660]   Excellent work on that
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.580]   woman schmuby
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:55.580]   Woman, no, I said that on purpose that time. I know I'm I'm used to being actually I'm used to being the queen of
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:53:00.780]   Oh, I'm used to introduce me as the queen of everything. I loved it queen of iot's good queen of iot queen of cloud
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:02.380]   It was awesome. I'm zarina
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:05.660]   They they keep asking me to come back now that lance eulon office is doing it for mashable
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:08.780]   But I so yeah, and I don't want to get in lances way so he's doing a great job
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:12.860]   But I do think that they would love to have a perky
[01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:17.020]   bubbly vivacious young woman doing it that would be
[01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:19.020]   Is she hiding behind me?
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:25.660]   All right, all right, what else uh the new york times
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:28.780]   I enjoyed the scene
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:32.060]   The great ai is really really really good. Have you read it?
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:39.420]   Not yet. Give me a new express how you google used artificial intelligence to transform google translate and how machine learning
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:43.820]   So it's just phenomenal. It's it's about it's about a couple things one is
[01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:47.980]   The notion of ai and learning systems and neural networks
[01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:50.700]   having been basically in a in a
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:57.820]   Clubhouse for wackos and wackos to strut clubhouse for strange believers for years and years and years and finally it starts to come out
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:58.860]   And here's their chance
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:04.860]   Yeah, and how the people all the pieces came together and how they decided at one point that the thing to really tackle was translation
[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:07.340]   Nice and and the most amazing thing to me
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:16.460]   Corporate Lee is that you you hit this point where they start working on translation and by the way interestingly the chips they use are purposely approximate
[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:19.580]   You don't want the answer
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:23.020]   Pratheg you there. You don't want the answer is 7.1 5 6 you want the answer is 7
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:27.420]   We used to call it fuzzy logic. Exactly. So they had to build new chips for it
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:31.260]   They had to all kinds of stuff for it and they tested out and they find wow the improvement
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:36.700]   In we can make right now in translation is better than the improvement has been in the entire 10 years of google translate
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:42.620]   And then they go to the head of translate they're at an event and they corner them and say hey, you know
[01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:44.620]   We got some cool code here. You want it?
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:50.620]   And the amazing thing to me is you would think that the reflex would be that's not gonna be that's awful clearly it doesn't work
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:53.660]   We know what we're doing. We're doing it for years. Get out of it. Get off my lawn, right?
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:59.020]   But no, not the google way is oh well, you can demonstrate to me. That's better. Okay, we're just gonna throw out 10 years of code
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:04.060]   Right and and they and then so when they when they happen happens to be at the 10th year
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:08.380]   Anniversary of translate so they're all wearing the hoodies and there's kind of a solemn moment
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:11.420]   Well, what are we gonna erase the code? We were number two for 10 years
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:16.220]   Um, but but it explains in good layman's terms
[01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:20.300]   Uh, which may mean it's BS. I don't know I can understand it
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:28.860]   Uh, you know how this works and how language is is analyzed differently and how fuzzy logic and neural networks work
[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:36.540]   Uh in just different ways and how what we know the rule of google all along has been rule sets don't work
[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:42.460]   Understanding data works, right? If you look at that at the the argument made long ago
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:46.780]   By one of the original google employees that if you're gonna solve misspelling
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:51.340]   The standard answer is a dictionary, but the right answer is how we all miss bell words
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:55.020]   And if you're gonna solve translation, you're gonna solve it through
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:00.060]   Other structures, but the tran the improvement in translation was amazing was phenomenal
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:04.140]   And it tells that story. I'm sure this is gonna be a book because it's it's fascinating
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:08.780]   We could this would be a good segment to do
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:12.540]   You're read of the week
[01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:15.340]   It means that you have to read things
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:21.260]   Well, I think just in the course of uh our research. Yeah, yeah, you're gonna come across like this
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:23.980]   Well, we can all all nominate them. Yeah
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:30.940]   Um reco did that the best stories of 2016 and there were actually I think I read both of them
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:32.780]   There was one I hadn't read
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:35.980]   But they were pretty good. Well, this is an occupational put a one
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:41.020]   But that's an occupational hazard. We read it. We read everything right. We have to well
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:44.620]   I open tabs with everything. Yes, I forget to read much of it
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:48.460]   My favorite tab right now is
[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:52.540]   The tab of the week is even better. Oh, there we go. Most promising tab
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:57.340]   There we have a thing tab or how about that the best story. I haven't read. Yeah
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:00.700]   I think this is gonna be good one. I could tell
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:03.660]   I like the graphics a lot
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:08.860]   So my I do hardly recommend to everyone in this audience. I think you'll appreciate it is
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:13.660]   And it also got me to thinking more about AI. You know if I think about AI and journalism
[01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:19.580]   Is stupid stuff like well, we'd be better at personalizing to you. You know see earlier discussion about how you're manipulated
[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:27.740]   Um, but but this notion of taking all of the comments and all the discussions and mapping where the controversy and where the heat and where the
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.500]   The anger is
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:33.820]   Is finding the patterns and discussion to where they come from that's something that that with a huge
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:41.180]   um corpus of data and and with this kind of learning system you could do amazing things and see what the world is talking about
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:46.060]   You probably would have predicted Donald Trump. You would have predicted things if you had a better sense of the conversation
[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:49.500]   Uh, that's that's rethinking AI. Sorry
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:54.140]   So that's that's the promise and that's what people think but
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:58:00.860]   These models are built by people with inherent biases. So we have to keep that in mind when we're talking about like
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:03.500]   the promise of AI because
[01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:08.700]   That you can throw a lot of data, but the models aren't neutral
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:11.580]   So just just I have to put that in because everyone's like, yes, it's
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:15.340]   Indeed, Stacy. I'm I'm arguing exactly that in fact
[01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:22.060]   What we have to do is to recognize is is to choose and be transparent about some level of the biases
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:24.540]   so in the in the um
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:27.020]   climate change argument, right?
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:29.420]   um
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:34.780]   You I would argue that you want to give a bias to scientists and academics maybe journalists
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:37.420]   That's a much but scientists
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:38.380]   Right
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:42.220]   Um, but the argument being made on the other side is you know, these institutions are all bad
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:43.660]   So what what is your?
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:45.420]   institutional bias
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:49.900]   Do you bias in favor of institutions or not is a key political issue right now?
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:52.380]   But I have to believe that that
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:55.900]   Well, again, I'll say what I said that what what the other side said but I was talking to
[01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:58.140]   um somebody at google I said
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:00.300]   I
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:03.500]   Part of the problem is anticipating the um
[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:07.020]   The user's desire
[01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:12.620]   Is kind of what google does and I said I think that maybe you need to move past that now to think about
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:17.980]   Anticipating your true or to the the knowledge and the facts and the truth
[01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:20.220]   Then there's always no
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:22.460]   I know there isn't but you're going to end up in some level
[01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:27.820]   So so here here's my point that that if you argue that oh so and so comes in looking for the
[01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:29.820]   conspiracy theory then they should find it
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:31.980]   um
[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:39.020]   Okay, I'm not saying the conspiracy theory shouldn't be linked to but imagine that your user is always a third grader who's curious
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:45.660]   Okay, how well are you informing that person and if you if you desire to inform that person well
[01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:48.460]   Then I would argue that you will
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:51.180]   Have to put in a bias
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:54.060]   to authoritarian authoritarian
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:57.420]   um
[01:59:57.500 --> 02:00:01.900]   Sources to academics and scientists and it's like the pv is and things like that
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:07.820]   That's a bias but I'd rather have that bias than the bias of volume which will take you to the correct parts
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:15.580]   Sorry, I will also no no, that's it's just true and I like I like that a third grader who's curious i'm like mental model for the world
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:16.860]   um
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:20.940]   the other thing that people I think neglect to think about with ai is
[02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:27.020]   The data they're using is your data. So ever note actually just got in trouble for
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:33.340]   Wanting to apply AI to its stuff and it it didn't explain this well or maybe it maybe it did maybe it was more honest
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:35.980]   I this is this is where people
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:39.580]   I think this is why we need better privacy
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:44.140]   Policies that are very transparent about what's happening because
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:54.620]   All of like when google's listening to your voice for google home or the echo is what it's doing is it's taking what you say in building better models from it
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:01:04.380]   With ever note they said they wanted to use the information in your notes to build machine learning that could like take information from your notes and generate a task list from it
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:10.700]   What people thought what people heard was you are going to have people reading my notes
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:14.060]   And is it different if there's a computer in a person?
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:19.820]   Only if the computer is the only thing that sees it and right now we don't have policies that actually say things like that
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:24.700]   And we don't have a way to enforce it even so because they can always give that data to the government
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:29.580]   Anyway, this is why AI is such we never talk about this and it drives me nuts
[02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:35.100]   Well, I think there's a couple things there Stacey on the data the story about Cambridge, Analytica
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:37.740]   And how it manipulated us
[02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:40.060]   voters for Brexit and for Trump and so on
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:44.300]   Um, and what I love people have talked to said oh, it was the stories have been overblown
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:49.660]   Hey, this has been happening for years. They're not so special but but it strikes me that there is a new right there
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:53.900]   There's a difference from a right to privacy and there's a right to knowing what companies know about you
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:02:01.340]   There's a right to a transparency from that other side and and so you can know how they manipulate you so you can correct it
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:03.740]   So you can just be creeped out whatever it is
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:09.260]   Um, rather than forbidding people to know things about you, which is another game of whack-a-mole
[02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:13.900]   Which I don't think will work, you know, Amazon knows what I bought. I can't take that knowledge away from them
[02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:19.420]   But what else do they know about me? What does axiom know about me? What does mean, you know, taimie
[02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:21.980]   knows tons of crap about you because they they they
[02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:26.460]   Um, if you ever subscribe to a magazine for those of you who don't know what it is
[02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:29.260]   It's a very nice slick paper thing that has staples in it. It's very nice
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.260]   um
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:33.260]   then um
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:37.340]   They tie that data with your name and address to this huge base of data
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:39.180]   Uh in a place like axiom
[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:41.340]   Well, I think you have a right to know that your right state
[02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:44.940]   See it's your data at an individual level and it's your data at an aggregate level
[02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:49.020]   And if it's if it's your data if it's our data rather at an aggregate level
[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:55.180]   Well, how much right do we have to the exhaust from its analysis because we're the ones who contributed value to that?
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:57.420]   These are yeah, I agree
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:03.740]   Well, the mistake is because we do assume that an AI is somehow any better than a human in that regard, right?
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:07.660]   I mean, yes, and this this article makes that argument that that's that's a false goal
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:13.100]   Yeah, we all understand not that every human has a bias and just you know kind of understand that
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.500]   but because of
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:19.260]   You know kind of science fiction. We have this idea that shiny machines are perfect
[02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:23.340]   And I think anybody who spends any time with shiny machines learns very quickly
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:26.300]   They are not perfect. They mess up
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:34.220]   That was the that was the trend and the obama administration was data driven policy technocrats technocrats are dangerous too
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:37.580]   Well, and yeah in this case. I'm right now
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:44.140]   Technocrats, we were talking in the chat room one of the things I think would be really good
[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:47.980]   but beyond sp skeptical thinking or a critical thinking
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:51.340]   And and my daughter when she was a freshman at bard
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:54.620]   This was a requirement and before you began the second semester
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:04:00.300]   The president of bard was adamant that everybody to be a citizen of this country to be a
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:04.380]   Productive citizen should understand how scientific method works
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:12.220]   And they had a requirement before you know you'd come back from christmas vacation before classes started a two-week
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:18.780]   Program in scientific method in which you was barred. Yeah, which you would do the last place you'd expect it to occur
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:23.020]   I know because it's such a liberal arts hippie. Yeah, but no he's by the way the president of bard
[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:27.100]   I wish I could remember his name is brilliant and this was absolutely right on he said if you're gonna
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:30.140]   Be a good citizen in this modern day and age you not need to understand
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:34.380]   You can't go around saying well, it's a theory. So you know it could be false
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:37.980]   you need to understand how scientific method works and
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:39.980]   and and you know
[02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:45.580]   I hope that we celebrate here not just technology, but science technology is science applied
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:51.260]   And the scientific method and I think that is to some degree an antidote
[02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:58.620]   To all of this smooshy facts is fact facts is what is a fact post facts truthiness truthiness
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:01.580]   Factiness. Yeah
[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:05.020]   Um, anyway
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:08.380]   Let's let's wrap things up. I'm sure stacey. You've got a fabulous
[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:11.820]   Christmas. Yeah, but you have enough for Christmas last show of the
[02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:17.500]   I mean, I see do you see Christmas presents behind me? Oh, you can sort of see them behind my daughter's
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:19.820]   presence
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:21.820]   So exciting
[02:05:21.820 --> 02:05:23.820]   What do you what do you get?
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:25.820]   She doesn't listen to the show. So I'm okay
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:32.460]   Uh, the little Nintendo DS with the pokie mind son or moon and she's gonna be happy about that
[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:37.340]   Yes, and one of those uh instant cameras the fuji max
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:44.220]   Yeah, the polaroid clone. Yeah. Yeah, those it they're so cute and they come with all these like little rainbow films and they're cheap
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:50.540]   They're great. They're like 60 bucks. I mean relatively compared to yes, uh, sx 70 costs in my day
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:58.700]   Well, I remember like I got a laklick camera when I was like 10 and I still have photos polar right swinger
[02:05:58.700 --> 02:06:03.100]   meet the swing swing it up. Yeah. Yeah, take a shot. Yeah, yeah
[02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:08.460]   Spit it out shake it for a while turns into a picture
[02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:11.980]   I don't think that's how the jingle goes. I was like wow
[02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:18.060]   I got for my son who wants to be studying journalism the ap style guide and legal guide
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:25.180]   Important right and i'm gonna give him the attention merchants uh book. Uh, hello. Hello and
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:27.900]   You can give him what?
[02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:29.660]   Jeff charters
[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:33.900]   Tuition to the city of cutie graduate school of journals. I I absolutely am encouraging him to do that
[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:36.700]   He wants to seriously i'll talk to him seriously. I like great
[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:40.460]   He actually, you know what that's great. I will I will give him your email
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:42.860]   Uh, he wants to take a piece of time
[02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:48.780]   Uh, he's he's trying to get in somewhere like advice or buzzfeed or watch it stacey head gum or somewhere
[02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:51.740]   Huh? What did she say? How come hook him hook him there is?
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:54.300]   Oh, that's a pretty good school too. I hear
[02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:59.100]   It's it's one of i've got an actual bachelor's of journalism from ut. I know it's a good school
[02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:04.380]   No, you know what I love about this show and sometimes people say why are you guys talk so much about you know the press and media and news
[02:07:04.380 --> 02:07:12.460]   These are like two professional journalists surrounded by it literally you're surrounded and I can't not take advantage of their wisdom and knowledge
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:15.100]   honey
[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:19.900]   Go ahead. You're talking to jeff right? Yeah, schmuppy. What's your pick? You're no schmuppy
[02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:26.460]   Oh, are we doing our picks? Yeah, is it my pick or jeff's pick you start? Oh, you start spoops. All right
[02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:29.660]   This week's pick is the canary flex
[02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:33.340]   I know about the canary, um, like it's a camera, right?
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:39.420]   It is so the canary all in one security device is an indoor camera that has sensors to track
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:43.420]   uh temperature humidity and vocs
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:47.420]   Flex is their brand new outdoor camera. Oh, which
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:51.420]   All right. So here's what you need to know about this because it's this is a
[02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:56.620]   Hollywood caveat at review. So this is a flex. It's got it's like the arlo. It's got the magnet
[02:07:56.620 --> 02:08:00.860]   It can be wired or wireless. So is it battery powered?
[02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:04.620]   It's battery powered if you're running it obviously wirelessly
[02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:06.540]   um
[02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:12.620]   Now the challenge I had because I I played with this it is very much like the nest cam. It's a rechargeable
[02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:15.180]   It's rechargeable. Oh, yes
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:17.820]   Sorry, so the battery is rechargeable, but
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:26.140]   Right now it does not work with mesh Wi-Fi networks because and this is check this out you guys. I learned a lot
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:28.860]   Um, my era routers apparently
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:34.540]   All right, we're gonna get into some some tech talk that even i'm not basically it
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:38.460]   Does the encryption key every 10 minutes on the era routers?
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:47.100]   Which I can't figure out if this is too many too often or not enough for this camera because what happens is it falls offline and it thinks it's offline
[02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:53.260]   So for me it didn't work until I plugged it in so in battery mode it doesn't work if you have a mesh network
[02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:57.260]   Yeah, it's saving battery, but it sounds like frankly a bug. I don't I think that it's there
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:09:01.100]   Yeah, they're gonna fix it. They know they were like, are you running an euro by chance?
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:03.100]   Would I describe my issue to them?
[02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:07.260]   So I thought it was kind of worth knowing one because it's always nice to have an
[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:13.500]   If you're in the canary ecosystem already, this is a good camera for you because right now they don't actually pull in
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:16.460]   Their camera data into anything except for wink
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:21.100]   So if you want to like if you have a nest outdoor cam, it doesn't go into the save app
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:24.220]   Which I don't know if that may or may not be a thing you care about
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:30.060]   Um, and also because it feels good in the hand so the hardware is nice and once they work out this bug
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:32.060]   I feel like it could be a really good camera
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:36.700]   So do you have to have the big canary to use the flex? You do not okay
[02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:42.380]   And uh, how does it stick is it it looks like it's a magnet
[02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:45.420]   So there is a magnet so I was playing with the magnet now
[02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:49.340]   They have mounting hardware and on the back of the magnet just like the arlo
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:51.420]   There's like a little
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:56.540]   Doohickey that you stick that into the wall or whatever and then it it hangs off that
[02:09:56.540 --> 02:10:03.820]   I'm tempted. Oh, was she was she did? Yeah, but I would wait until they got a fix the euro
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:07.420]   Yeah, they got a fix all let you know when that happens because i'm keeping my camera until
[02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:14.060]   They issue a bug fix and we'll see if that works. That's the problem with these battery powered ones
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:16.060]   They can't be on all the time
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:20.140]   Uh because obviously battery would last a day so
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:27.580]   Uh, you have to they have to turn on whenever you check it and I bet you yeah, they feel like the Wi-Fi died
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.820]   Yeah
[02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:31.820]   and uh
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:37.580]   And then it's not just Stacy's favorite thing. It's one of Oprah's favorite things. Oh, well
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:42.860]   No, no, she likes the so I and this is I was really disappointed because I actually love the canary
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:49.820]   System this is this is my sign for the canary system right here because it's got this kind of circular shape. It's whoopie doopie. Yeah
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:52.460]   Um, I think it's
[02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:58.220]   It's a nice product. I recommend it to people who are renting or like kids going to college you want to give them a gift
[02:10:58.220 --> 02:11:02.700]   You know, this is a nice thing because there's no installation you just put it on the shelf. Yeah, just like
[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:05.740]   There it is and it's got you know
[02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:10.700]   It's got motion detector. It's it has an alarm in it. It does makes it really loud. Yeah
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:15.420]   Not by the way, not loud enough that a burglar wouldn't come over and unplug it, but okay
[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:19.260]   Yeah, well, it does it does send you a message. Yeah
[02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:25.180]   That is that is the exciting thing and on the app for the flex and I think for the canary
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:30.060]   System they now have this thing where you can just hit emergency call and what it does
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:36.700]   Is it actually goes to you can set where your canary is physically located? So when you make the call
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:43.180]   It's calling the right area, which if you're familiar with like e 9 1 1 and stuff. Yeah, that doesn't happen. Yeah
[02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:45.580]   So
[02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:49.100]   That's my very nice very nice canary flex
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:55.580]   And the prices vary depending on how many canaries you're buying and by the way, they've got a deal right now for
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:58.060]   you know, they're black friday specials
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:04.140]   So yeah, I think is the camera 250 or 200. I think if you buy two of them
[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:09.900]   I was because 169. Yeah, it's pretty cheap. It's 199 for one, but if you buy two
[02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:16.620]   It comes down. I think 150 or something like that. That's bad, but that's the canary itself. The flex is 199
[02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:18.300]   Yeah
[02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:20.940]   But they sell they sell multi packs of the flex as well
[02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:26.060]   The trio pack is 569 the twin pack is
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:30.620]   379 so it's like 180 so how do you where do you use this?
[02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:33.580]   I would so
[02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:39.740]   My test case is always my backyard because I have a dog who is an escape artist. So I actually put it
[02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:44.140]   If it's an indoor camera, I have it facing out because I don't like cameras in my house
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:48.060]   But if it's outdoor, I just stick it kind of on my backyard and then
[02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:50.780]   if possible I trigger it to
[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:54.060]   I'll either trigger it this has a motion sensor in it
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:58.460]   So it triggers itself, but otherwise I trigger it with a motion sensor in front of the dog door
[02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:02.620]   So when she goes outside, it's like recording and I can see how she escapes
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:05.580]   And then block that part of the fence. Oh, I see it's too. Okay
[02:13:05.580 --> 02:13:10.060]   When she does escape how hard is it to get her back? Oh, she always comes home
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:14.220]   Okay, it's just I would rather her not get hit by a car or something. Yeah, amen
[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:16.940]   I used to freak out where as a kid about that
[02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:20.940]   She hates the neighbor across the street from us. So I usually can tell
[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:27.260]   That she's escaped because I hear her barking and I go out and there's my neighbor who's like your dog hates me
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:29.580]   And I'm like, I'm really sorry. Let me bring you some cookies
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:34.700]   It's embarrassing
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:40.060]   Jeff Jarvis your number of the week saw very very excited about this. I saw while we were on the show
[02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:46.220]   New York tech community is going to get a 250 million dollar home base at union square in New York, New York
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:49.420]   Andrew rishay who runs
[02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:57.580]   Civic hall, which is about technology and also civic life and other things with my good friend mica sipry
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:02.780]   I've been working on this for a while. I knew it was possible out there in the city and
[02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:05.740]   They are going to have
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:08.700]   Huge amounts of space. Where is it here?
[02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:17.260]   Classrooms and meeting spaces on the lower floor is flexible office space designed for early stage companies
[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:23.420]   on a dozen higher floors at street level will be a food hall for New York based startup vendors
[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:29.740]   managed by urban space. This is this is amazing. I mean I got a little um
[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:36.780]   Oh, I don't know a boosterish about New York versus you dam Californians and new Texans
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:41.980]   but but uh, you know, I've been talking to
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:47.580]   Startups for dot NYC. It really is neat to see here how it's not just about software eating the world
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:53.340]   It's about the confluence of technology and and media and advertising and fashion and
[02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:59.420]   Education and all kinds of things so Andrew's long been a leader fighting for Wi-Fi in New York and other things
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:01.500]   he's a very good guy and
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:06.940]   Uh, and this has been his dream to move civic hall and startups and classrooms
[02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:12.060]   General assembly and others will be there. So I just wanted to give them a major congratulations
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:14.300]   It'll be open in 2020
[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:20.300]   Uh, but um, it starts to itself driving cars are coming out. Yeah, so you just you don't need it. Yeah
[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:28.460]   I'll just get there on the on the subway. I'm a subway person. That's when Kanye is going to become president. Oh g. Oh, I thought he said he would wait
[02:15:28.460 --> 02:15:33.260]   Oh, now he's gonna wait a little longer after meeting with donald. He said i'll give you eight years and i'll take over after
[02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:36.140]   I thought that was happening, but that could be fake news. I don't know
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:40.220]   I I saw him say I saw him say on tv. He's running for president
[02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:46.060]   I did see that in 2020 but maybe he's decided to you know now that you know, he's got donald in there
[02:15:46.060 --> 02:15:47.740]   He would wait to give him an extra four years
[02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:53.820]   The what I thought it was fake news that the daily mill reported this and it was a couple of days before it came out that that
[02:15:53.820 --> 02:15:56.860]   Trump was seriously trying to convince
[02:15:56.860 --> 02:15:59.580]   Someone for the national number for the arts
[02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:02.140]   rocky
[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:05.580]   Yeah, so that's just long for the national damage there's hey, you know
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:08.380]   At least he wants to keep the nea going
[02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:15.340]   Uh, it's it's been kind of a public in kin and for years to get rid of the nea so it's a way to kill the area
[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:19.420]   Well, if yeah, if you i don't know still lawns in art it let look that's not
[02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:26.300]   That's not rocky always wins. Come on. That's not be too elitist alone is an actor rambos gonna shoot it apart. All right
[02:16:26.300 --> 02:16:30.060]   I think actually the most astute thing I read is that
[02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:35.420]   Uh, the president elect likes to pick people because they look the part. Well, that's my my friend peter binaart
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:40.780]   uh wrote that piece in the elanic, uh, it really really is and um
[02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:46.060]   The lie he didn't use it because it's not an appointment made but um larry cudlow
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:52.380]   From cmdc for one on the top economic post he said he's not an economist. He plays one on tv
[02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:59.340]   Right, um, but yes, he's casting a show he's casting it. Yeah. Yeah, and you know to be honest. I don't think it'll be any worse
[02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:01.020]   Then
[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:04.700]   So-called experts. I'm not sure it'll be a lot worse. We'll see we'll find out
[02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:07.180]   Hey, we're gonna find us
[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:09.180]   The the clock is ticking
[02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:14.860]   Uh my pick of the week. I have by the way. We got through almost this entire show. I threw that in it's my hardly
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:21.660]   No, just gonna. I want credit with the audience here. We hardly a political discussion people now give us some credit on twitter for that
[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:24.220]   Huh, huh? You just complain
[02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:33.260]   Can't you thank us now? I this is that my pet peeve is it companies and journalists and news channels and people like us
[02:17:33.980 --> 02:17:39.900]   Give any weight at all the complaints on twitter. Yes, that's the easiest thing to do is complain on twitter
[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:41.900]   It's what twitter was built to do
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:46.540]   And so but I see it over and over again, you know the the newest thing is
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:51.900]   Oh, the public, you know, the people are up in arms over xyz commercial
[02:17:51.900 --> 02:17:54.780]   Because there were 10 tweets on twitter
[02:17:54.780 --> 02:18:01.020]   So that's how journalists who all live in New York or san francisco and with the real people think yeah
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:07.100]   Because we can't leave our desks anymore because god help us if we don't turn out 12 stories a day. Yeah, hey
[02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:10.300]   Oh, yeah, yeah
[02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:15.980]   Twitter is not it's just twitter. It's what it is. It's not anything more or less
[02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:22.700]   How about that? That's my new attitude that that's wonderful. Twitter is what it is
[02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:25.820]   Either more nor less
[02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:30.940]   I have been trying every mesh product under the sun
[02:18:30.940 --> 02:18:36.140]   As you know, I got the google. I got the hero. I got
[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:41.980]   You've been doing you've been to in this too stacey. Uh, you you had the plume plume
[02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:47.500]   Eero i've got the orbi and the almaj 3 so you got the orbi i just i'm supposed to be so confused
[02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:49.500]   I just got the orbi last night
[02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:55.500]   Um, and i'm gonna make this uh my pick this is i think not really mesh i think is part of the thing
[02:18:55.500 --> 02:18:57.500]   This is what this is a much more traditional
[02:18:57.500 --> 02:19:02.940]   AC 3000 net gear router with lots of power and a satellite
[02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:10.620]   Which uses a separate back channel so you don't have the problem that repeaters have of of sharing the bandwidth for inter
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:18.620]   Satellite communication so because it goes it goes around the band you use it's able to have high speed communication with a satellite
[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:23.420]   So in effect, it's a very powerful router with a very powerful repeater
[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:29.420]   But at least i put it in last night and i have to say is powerful i get a very strong signal
[02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:35.820]   And the reason i tried it is because i was having and i wonder if that the sonos aren't having the same problem that the
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:40.300]   That the canaries are having the sonos does not like the hero
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:45.580]   My sonos does not dislike the hero at all. Oh, but maybe it's me then i don't know
[02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:51.900]   I'm not networking issues. I mean every network is a special snowflake and has it's so that's really true
[02:19:51.980 --> 02:19:56.860]   And I think our house is a hostile environment. I really do. Oh, it's gotta be the people's thing didn't work right away
[02:19:56.860 --> 02:19:59.100]   The hero didn't work right away, but these are
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:03.980]   Be kind of worked right away. I had I had a manually do the firmware update
[02:20:03.980 --> 02:20:09.340]   It never did its firmware update properly and unlike the hero it doesn't do automatic updates and things like that
[02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:13.740]   So it's a very different product. It's much more to me much more like a fictional router
[02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:16.460]   You don't use the app the app doesn't do anything you use the web
[02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:21.980]   Interface to it and inside the web interface many of the same things like qos many of the same
[02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.820]   uh, you know
[02:20:23.820 --> 02:20:26.460]   Port forwarding stuff. It's very traditional kind of interface
[02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:31.580]   But I have to say the power is really good and it is very very fast. I'm getting
[02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:34.220]   Very how many how many units do you have to have
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:39.260]   They sell you can get additional ones but two for a 4 000 square foot house
[02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:43.340]   They say and that's about what we have and that's it. It seems to be doing a pretty good job
[02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:49.500]   So well, I take it all back just as I say that one minute ago on twitter f u jeff jarvis trump has won
[02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:56.780]   So go gtf oh f kilary failure clinton. Oh, well, I guess we haven't made all the fans fat happy
[02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:00.620]   You know what don't post my twitter address anymore
[02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:04.460]   I only get nice people
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:10.140]   Solid wow this is the how do you say this about that solid glass ceiling
[02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:15.820]   Yeah, whatever. Let me say let me say this about that. Um, Jesus
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:21.500]   We don't cover politics. We cover technology, but there is definitely an intersection of politics and technology
[02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:26.620]   The fcc's story for instance net neutrality. We will cover it then
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:32.780]   Uh, there are some trump supporters who believe that anything at all critical of trump
[02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:38.380]   Is uh, in impugning them and their intelligence. I got an email and says we're not all stupid
[02:21:38.380 --> 02:21:40.460]   I didn't say you were stupid. Nobody said you were stupid
[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:48.220]   Um, but but just as we criticized just as I mean we talked a lot about edward snoden and critiques of the obama administration's
[02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:55.180]   Uh, lack of transparency and nsa snooping. We talked about that almost incessantly for the last three or four years
[02:21:55.180 --> 02:22:00.460]   Uh, you can expect us to talk maybe not always positively about the next administration
[02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:05.900]   Uh particularly when in in in the you know realm of tech stories that's going to happen
[02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:11.420]   Uh, and it happens more on this show and probably twit than the other shows where we're talking about, you know
[02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:13.420]   Mac and tashes or windows or whatever so
[02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:20.140]   Uh, it's fine with me if you feel you don't want to listen to the show because you don't you're you don't want to your ears to hear anything negative
[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:22.620]   Um, that would be fine
[02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:27.660]   But we are going to cover it because we that's what we do we cover these things
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:34.780]   Uh, and uh, I'm not saying trump is stupid and I don't think you are saying trump supporters are stupid
[02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:38.300]   But we are going to cover those stories
[02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:42.380]   Okay
[02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:45.580]   Put that up put that on our on a loop and we'll play it anytime
[02:22:45.580 --> 02:22:50.860]   I think that's I think that's fair put it on youtube and I can just link anybody to it. I have respect against a good
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:52.860]   Uh
[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:56.300]   Guess what uh trump won the election at fair and square
[02:22:56.300 --> 02:23:00.780]   I'm gonna say fair and square and he's gonna be president in less than a month and we'll see what happens
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:04.140]   And we will see what happens
[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:06.140]   That will be interesting
[02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:09.740]   And somebody says the problem is the constant bashing. I don't think it's constant
[02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:14.620]   But I think the problem is some people are very sensitive and any bashing sounds like constant bashing
[02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:17.100]   so
[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:19.100]   There it is
[02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:21.660]   Uh
[02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:27.900]   One last story. Thank you mars worm. Uh, we I got I got a finish up with this story from fandroid.com
[02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:31.180]   Somebody got on a
[02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:33.100]   airplane
[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:37.260]   And named his Wi-Fi hotspot. She's galaxy note seven
[02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:46.300]   Galaxy note seven. Oh, that was a that was a nasty thing to do. I think serenity called will was on the flight
[02:23:46.300 --> 02:23:52.060]   So, uh, I guess that is kind of the equivalent of a bomb scare according to call
[02:23:52.060 --> 02:23:54.780]   Well, it's it's yelly is literally yelling fire in a theater
[02:23:54.780 --> 02:23:59.340]   She arrived at her gate to learn that her flight had been delayed several times before actually being canceled
[02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:02.540]   Flight of 10 spent the next few hours rescheduling a tenerary
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:05.420]   She overheard just a crew talking about what the ground of the plane the first place
[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:09.980]   The flight attendant noticed a galaxy note seven Wi-Fi hotspot mid flight
[02:24:09.980 --> 02:24:14.620]   Something that would have forced an emergency landing a person
[02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:19.260]   They'll not been able to track down the perp who likely had a long talk with a tsa upon landing
[02:24:19.260 --> 02:24:22.540]   so
[02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:24.780]   I don't know
[02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:26.780]   But that it let's not do that shall we kids
[02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:31.580]   All right, all right, so if you got if you got two more minutes two more minutes
[02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:38.780]   Well, let note so I think if you you can go to the video I put up under the numbers of the most uncomfortable interview in tv history
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:43.740]   Oh go anywhere in it anywhere in it, but I love this. This was the hollyword reporter
[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:49.020]   I thought did a really great piece on a large surprisingly large number of
[02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:52.540]   celebrities in hollywood who are in their 90s and still working
[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:55.020]   including, you know
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:24:57.580]   Don rickles bob new heart
[02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:11.660]   uh,
[02:25:11.660 --> 02:25:13.660]   Chloris leechman
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:16.620]   It was kind of cool. So they interviewed as part of this
[02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:18.620]   Uh, jerry louis
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:20.620]   Have you ever thought about retiring?
[02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:22.620]   Why?
[02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:24.620]   Was there never a moment?
[02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:26.620]   Why?
[02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:29.580]   And painfully awkward minutes with jerry louis
[02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:31.980]   You performed in vegas
[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:33.340]   1947
[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:38.700]   What can you tell me what what vegas was like when you first showed up? It's not it's the same
[02:25:38.700 --> 02:25:41.820]   It's the same exactly the same
[02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:49.740]   Like what what is it about vegas do you like or what is it about like how would you describe the the place
[02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:56.220]   Like we were shopping like in 47. What was it? I wasn't a little bit of a
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:25:58.220]   I've had interviews like this
[02:25:58.220 --> 02:25:59.820]   What was it like?
[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:01.820]   Dusty cow town
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:04.300]   And it's the same
[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:06.300]   Dusty cow town
[02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:08.300]   No
[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:15.340]   How about um is performing in vegas now for you different than it was then like just either the mechanics or the size of the
[02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:17.340]   No
[02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:21.100]   What's your audience like
[02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:25.420]   Your honor, I would like to have this witness declared a hostile witness and uh
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:32.300]   Who are your who are your fans? Are they different than they than they used to be? No, they're still the same
[02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:35.500]   He's just watching regulation
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:38.700]   I've had interviews like this. He just wants to get it over with
[02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:41.500]   What do you think it is? You have it that
[02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:45.980]   And you know when you're in your 90s, you're younger fans like god bless you do whatever you want
[02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:48.300]   He doesn't care anymore
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:50.300]   Why should he?
[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:53.900]   You're telling me you're playing there and they show up
[02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:56.620]   I
[02:26:56.620 --> 02:27:00.220]   I'm gonna be like that in about a month
