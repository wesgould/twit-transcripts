[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twig.

[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.200]   This is Twig.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.680]   This week in Google, Episode 34,
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.960]   from March 21, 2010, live from Google Luma.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.280]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.960]   to show the covers, everything in the Google
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.440]   Verse and the cloud, joining us the core cast of the show
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.320]   right now.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.000]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.360]   That's a nice shirt.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.800]   It is.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.680]   Like that.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.920]   Author of what would Google do?
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.320]   Working on a new book, we'll ask about that.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.320]   Also here, her book is out, Gina Tripani,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.280]   the author of the Complete Guide to Google Wave,
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   at completewaveguide.com.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240]   Also a blogger at smartaward.org.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.920]   There's your book.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.360]   There it is.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.480]   How's the sales?
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.440]   Hola.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.280]   They're good.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.720]   They're good.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.560]   They're going well.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.080]   Thank you.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.120]   Is everyone who bought a copy?
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.920]   If you haven't, buy one.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.760]   You don't actually have to read it.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.120]   Right.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.680]   Just buy it.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.680]   Just buy it.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680]   Just buy it.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.440]   That's so mean.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.320]   And we're good.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.480]   And we'll be your best friend.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.200]   Ooh, now you're sweet in the deal.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.320]   I love it.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.320]   So we met too.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.080]   We were at in Austin last week, and we
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.720]   had a wonderful time fun show.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.320]   And saw a lot of people out there.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.240]   Boy, it wasn't-- it was my first time.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.440]   And that is a great conference.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.720]   That is such a fun conference.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.800]   By the way, Gina's wearing her Google Slanket.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   Yeah, I am.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.080]   Lio gave us the Slanket.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.240]   And I didn't bring it to Austin because it was really big
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.320]   and tough to pack.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.640]   And it was hot in Austin.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640]   We didn't need it.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.140]   It was.
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.720]   And it was a little warm here in San Diego.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.620]   So I don't know that the Slanket's
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.620]   going to make it through the whole show.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.340]   I'm not wearing mine.
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.680]   It's too hot for a Slanket today.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.720]   We'll save that for winter.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.780]   It is the first day of spring.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.880]   Happy spring.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.520]   Woo hoo!
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   Happy spring.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.840]   Happy spring.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.600]   So one of the stories that we wanted to talk about,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.400]   we ran out of time last week, was the Google Apps
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.320]   Marketplace.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.480]   Just like there's an Android Marketplace selling Android
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.600]   applications, there's a Google Apps Marketplace.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.520]   And there are even some pretty good apps in there.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.620]   Yeah, there are.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.320]   This is pretty cool.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.920]   I thought this was a pretty interesting story.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.100]   So you can basically plug in web apps into Google Apps,
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.300]   which were also web apps.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.900]   So we really haven't seen this before, right?
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.100]   We've seen widgets that can go in different places.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.140]   We've seen extensions and book marklets.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.040]   But this is full-fledged web apps
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.620]   hooking into Google Apps.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.940]   So there are a couple of good ones.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.020]   And actually, I wrote this up.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.100]   This is two weeks ago.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.220]   And I can't remember.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.720]   OK.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.660]   There's batch book.
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.140]   Here's merge and automate.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.060]   Here's MailChimp.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.540]   The area, which is a really good image editor.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.180]   So basically, what this does is--
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.580]   depending on what the web app that's plugging into Google Apps,
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.060]   it depends on what it does.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.580]   But something like Aviary, for example,
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.980]   it's a really good online image and sound editor.
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.700]   When you connect Aviary to your Google Apps account,
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.900]   you can edit images and sound and save it.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.940]   And it saves directly to Google Docs.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.140]   And it's free.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.020]   And it's free.
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.820]   And it's free.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.180]   There are a lot that are free.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.380]   And there are a lot that cost--
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.160]   there's a description to be your premium version.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.200]   So this is pretty cool.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.260]   So when you use one of these apps in conjunction
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.480]   with Google Apps, first you skip the registration process.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.880]   You don't have to register for Aviary,
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.720]   because it already has all your information
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.200]   from your Google account.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.920]   And also, you get some work group functionality.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.800]   So this is for Google Apps accounts, right?
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.880]   So this is where people who have registered their domain
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.080]   with Google Apps.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.960]   So I can't use it just with my regular Gmail account.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.920]   Not just with your vanilla Gmail account.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   But if you've got the smithfamily.com and Jane
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.460]   and Joe have accounts there, if you enable Aviary,
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.220]   then everybody can get access.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.980]   You can automatically share images and edit images
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.340]   with all the people in the work group.
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.660]   So it really gives you kind of work group access permissions.
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.740]   And it uses Google Docs, your storage space,
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.620]   and Google Docs to save files.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.100]   It can access your calendar and your contacts.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.220]   Now, it tells you when you install the app,
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.460]   it says this will need access.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.340]   It tells you what it will need access to.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.460]   Similar to what Android lets you know when you install an app.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.980]   What components your account needs access to.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.260]   But it's pretty neat setup.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.420]   And I think that it's getting some exposure
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.580]   to a lot of these kind of third party web apps.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.660]   And what I really liked about it is that Google was like,
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.460]   we're not going to build all of these apps.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.620]   They exist, and we just want to create a bridge to them.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.100]   So I really dug that approach.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.660]   So we're not going to--
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.980]   I'm going to be cautious about trying
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.140]   to say that this is a big deal, having said that about buzz.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.540]   But is this kind of the beginning of the architecture
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.500]   we're going to see around Chrome OS and a web app world?
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.580]   I absolutely.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.460]   I think so.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.700]   I think this is all about Chrome OS.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.260]   I think this is all about getting enterprise folks
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.900]   to move over to Google Apps.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.180]   And to be able to say, hey, what app do you need?
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.900]   You need faxing.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.700]   We have e-fax.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.700]   You need images.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.060]   Editing.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.500]   We have aviary.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.020]   You need some trip it.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.420]   You need travel planning for your group.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.860]   Trip it is an awesome web app.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.980]   Plug's into Google Apps now.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.820]   You can share all your travel plans
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.300]   with everybody in your company.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.100]   This is absolutely all about saying,
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.900]   this is the app store for the web.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.420]   But everything's in the web now.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.860]   There's no--
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.620]   Is it new this week that Google put out an app
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.940]   to migrate off of Microsoft Exchange?
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.140]   Yes it is.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.740]   Yes it is.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.580]   This is an interesting one too.
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.860]   I haven't actually tried this because I don't have an exchange
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.860]   server.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.620]   I didn't think you would, Gina.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.420]   No.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.660]   That was a long time ago.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.820]   But yes, it's--
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.780]   Oh, geez, the URL is a little too long for me to read.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.660]   But if you Google switch from Microsoft Exchange,
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.420]   there's basically a migration tool that
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.340]   will import your mail, your contacts, your calendar
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.740]   from your Exchange server, regardless of what your setup
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.780]   is, whether you have one in house or otherwise,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.820]   and move it into Google Apps.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.260]   So yeah, Google's going for enterprise customers,
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.660]   and they're serious now.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.580]   And now, I mean, they've always been serious.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.260]   But now it's becoming a lot more practical for a small company
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.740]   that has an Exchange server who hates maintaining it.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.100]   And I would bet that many do.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.580]   Here's an easy escape hatch into Google.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.100]   By the way, this aviary application requires Flash.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.660]   So it's possible to have Flash applications as well.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.820]   I mean, there's no limit to what you can do with this.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.580]   You can have any application running on any platform?
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.220]   Yeah, I mean, I'm actually not sure what
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.660]   the-- in terms of development, what the hooks are like.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.060]   But yeah, there are quite a few web apps available.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.500]   It would have to run in the browser.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.700]   It has to be a web app.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.620]   Well, not necessarily.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.900]   There's this office sync, which is basically like Docverse.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.740]   It's a tool bar for Microsoft Word or Microsoft Office
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.660]   that syncs up.
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.540]   And that actually is available through Google Apps.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.500]   Well, there's games and analytics
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.020]   that are kind of behind the scenes, right?
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.540]   Yeah, I mean, but that's JavaScript.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.700]   And then runs a server side.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.860]   I'm sure software--
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.620]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.540]   But as long as it runs in the browser-- in other words,
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.140]   as long as it's a web app-- well, no.
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.540]   Because then, as you said, you could use Microsoft Office apps,
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.260]   too.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.060]   So the plug-in--
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.260]   Let's see a approval process for this stuff.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.380]   That's a good question.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.060]   I'm not sure.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.060]   I'm really not sure.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.580]   Is it an Apple-style approval process?
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.860]   I doubt it.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.860]   I doubt that.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.860]   I doubt that.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.860]   But it does-- I mean, it raises some questions.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.020]   It's like these apps can access-- there
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.900]   are hooks into accessing your Google Apps account
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.620]   information, which is going to include, obviously, some--
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.580]   there's some sensitive information that it can access.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.620]   So I imagine that they're going to approve apps.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.380]   And they're going to open up your apps account information
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.420]   that they're going to be pretty stringent about approvals.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.340]   But I'm not sure.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.420]   I have actually haven't heard from any developers.
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.460]   Everyone that I heard heard from had had their app launched
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.580]   with it, and were really happy.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.620]   It had gotten a lot more users.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.140]   I talked to the A.V.A.R.I. guy.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.900]   It's out by Southwest.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.900]   And he said that they'd gotten influx of users.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.420]   And he was really happy about that.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.420]   I bet they did.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.540]   So here's the approval process.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.220]   Listing in the Google Apps Marketplace
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.060]   is self-service and easy.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.860]   After creating a Marketplace vendor account
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.060]   and paying the one time $100 listing fee,
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.420]   you could publish one or more Marketplace listings that
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.180]   will be visible to the public as long as they adhere
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.620]   to the listing approval policy.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.780]   And here is the listing approval policy.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.540]   It's got to be business-related.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.900]   It doesn't look like--
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.420]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.700]   It looks like it's automatic.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.340]   No, it's very much like Android.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:33.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.300]   So we're going to have a problem here.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.780]   We're going to have the same app overload issue.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.460]   It's going to hit real soon, where you have with both iPhone
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.780]   and Android, a forest for the trees.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.300]   It's interesting.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.700]   It's the nice thing about this, though.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.700]   I mean, there are existing web apps, right?
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.980]   So like TripIt, Navy Area.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.100]   These are apps that I've reviewed in Life Hacker.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.740]   We knew and loved, right?
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.540]   So it's like, this is a brand that we trust already.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.780]   So it makes sense.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.580]   On the iPhone and Android, these are all new apps.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.460]   And you don't really know who's making them.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.620]   You haven't used them before.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.340]   Well, except for the apps that interface with existing
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.060]   services, right?
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.300]   Like Evernote, like the Evernote app, for example.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.940]   Or I could make a new app for the apps marketplace, right?
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.380]   Sure.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:12.740]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:18.140]   So if this proves popular, we start hitting overload soon.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.220]   But there is a large enterprise base.
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.540]   I mean, I wonder what Salesforce will think of this.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.300]   Has this become Salesforce?
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.900]   It goes after Microsoft, clearly.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.980]   But I can't think of it as going to be that robust, is it?
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.380]   Boy, if I were Salesforce, I would absolutely make sure I
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.140]   had an app in the marketplace.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.500]   Wouldn't you?
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.020]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.060]   I mean, what it does is it provides a very powerful way
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.660]   to get your hooks into a large group of users.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.420]   I think this is a win for everybody.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.580]   Well, I would love to see specialized things.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:55.100]   I think that educational market things, stuff for publishers.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.620]   Sure.
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.820]   I mean, Moodle should have a plugin for this, for instance.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.580]   Then you could have Moodle work with Google Apps.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.500]   And now you've got an educational platform.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.180]   I mean, I think this is very powerful, very exciting.
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.540]   It didn't get a whole lot of press,
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.620]   because you can't install it with your regular Google account,
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:10.820]   right?
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.300]   So you have to have a Google Apps account.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.620]   So that's one kind of big hurdle.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.340]   And yet you have to be an administrator on that account.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.940]   So only the administrator can enable these extra apps.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.140]   So--
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.380]   Or enterprise.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:19.940]   Well, yeah.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.740]   And it looks like I have to have a domain.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.060]   You have to--
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.060]   Right.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.580]   Right.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.860]   So it's not merely that I have a paid apps account,
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.180]   but it has to point to my own domain.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.860]   Right.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.100]   So I'd have to have a twit.tv Google Apps.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.860]   But that's 50 bucks per seat per year.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.060]   It's not hugely expensive.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.780]   And I think a lot of--
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:35.780]   Wait, wait.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.340]   So you have to have a paid domain to do it.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.420]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.020]   No, no.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.060]   I'm using the free edition.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.260]   And it works--
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:41.740]   Really?
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.260]   --sometimes.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:42.760]   Yep.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.980]   So you're allowed to have the free edition redirect
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.700]   to smarter where.org or whatever the--
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:56.980]   --
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.860]   have to have a paid commercial account.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.980]   But you're right, this goes back to the same problem
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.780]   you had with Buzz.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.100]   They've got to start to regularize the apps world
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.980]   to the rest of the Google world.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.060]   Yes.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.220]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.660]   So here's the big disparity, right?
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.300]   So before it was like a vanilla Google Apps account--
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.860]   a Google account, excuse me--
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.660]   got things like voice, Buzz, Reader,
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.140]   and Google Apps accounts didn't have that.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.780]   And now Google Apps accounts have
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.460]   accessed all these third party web apps,
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.060]   but vanilla Google accounts don't.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.380]   So yeah, it's interesting to see them kind of split off.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:27.940]   I mean, ideally--
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.860]   As you heard about Buzz, they do complain about it
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.420]   within Google.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.300]   But the more things they add to each,
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.940]   the harder it's going to be to bring them together, I think.
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.260]   It's not clear to me why there's such a split between the two
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.540]   platforms and why it's so different and why the release
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.660]   schedules are different.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.900]   Yeah, I'm not sure if it's just too--
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.980]   I don't know.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.620]   I don't know.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.300]   The Googler that I spoke to said
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.420]   that there was a good reason why there was this split
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.700]   and why there are these differences,
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.380]   that they're working on resolving it.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.500]   But that seems to be the line whenever something's not
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.020]   working.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.940]   So we'll see.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.140]   Let's talk a little bit about Buzz,
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.020]   because it really seems like Buzz flopped.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.500]   I hate to say this, because I am a big Buzz fan.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.820]   I'm surprised you're saying, Leo, you're the Buzz lover.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.020]   I'm a Buzz lover.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.220]   You're so excited about buzzing from Maps at South By.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.780]   Did you use Buzz at South By.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.780]   I use Buzz Nonstop.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.660]   In fact, my tool of the week is a Buzz tool.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.740]   But it looks to me, if I look through Buzz
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.180]   and all the people I'm following, that almost every--
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.180]   very few people are doing--
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.140]   to me, for Buzz to be a success, people
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.540]   have to post natively in Buzz.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.660]   And I have to comment on posts and interact and engage.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.020]   And right now, I don't see very many people doing that.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.140]   I see a lot of ported content from Twitter, from Flickr,
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:42.900]   from Google Reader.
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.980]   There's not much discussion there.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.180]   I admit that I went way overboard on Buzz.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.420]   I saw all this potential and all these implications.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.540]   And it ain't clicking.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.380]   It needs a rethink.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.780]   I still get quite a bit of engagement on mine.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.020]   And what I've done, Lewis Gray said he's going to do it too,
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.500]   is I've turned off importing.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.340]   So it is just native Buzz.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.580]   And well, you know what?
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.020]   The engagement has gone down quite a bit.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.660]   43 comments, 40 comments.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.500]   Even if the stuff from South By has many more comments
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.540]   than the stuff since South By, perhaps.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.300]   I am posting a show--
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.180]   as we do a show, as I've done today,
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.500]   I post a new Buzz entry so that there can be some engagement
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.540]   there.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.700]   There just needs to be something to bring it together here.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.340]   Between Twitter and Facebook and Buzz,
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.060]   and whatever else is out there, for that matter,
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.620]   friend feed and things like that,
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.580]   I think it's a problem that we can't live in five worlds.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.580]   The winner in social is he or she who organizes the internet
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.580]   as a social network rather than getting
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.140]   us to go to a social network.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.220]   Definitely.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.820]   I've announced right after we did Twig at South By Southwest,
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.540]   a new at-anywhere platform for Twitter, which makes Twitter--
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.620]   or the goal is to make Twitter the single sign-on
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.940]   for a lot of sites, Huffington Post, Yahoo.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.180]   A lot of people signed up to do this.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.300]   It makes it very easy to tweet from within the Huffington
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.620]   Post, for instance, without even going to Twitter.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.340]   Is Twitter unassailable at this point?
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.460]   Do they own this space?
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.580]   Yeah, I love Evan.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.260]   I love Twitter, but the ad-anywhere thing really kind of left me cold.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.700]   I was like, oh, great.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.820]   I have another way to sign into places.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.980]   Like Facebook, Open ID, my Google account, my Yahoo account,
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.820]   those weren't enough.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.100]   Like now I can sign in with Twitter.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.980]   And I also just was kind of confused about the announcement.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.260]   I was like, oh, at-anywhere.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.500]   So I can see--
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.420]   Science being bad grammar.
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.260]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.340]   It's like being bad grammar.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.420]   It's like, oh, so I can tweet at a blog post author
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.860]   from the Huffington Post.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.660]   Like, it didn't really make sense to me.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.020]   So I mean--
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.180]   I was hoping you could explain it to me, Gina.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.780]   Well, I think they've been watching anything.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.220]   They just announced--
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.540]   I think is going on.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:06.620]   And this became clear when Facebook changed its URL style
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.380]   from this weird number thing to a name,
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.260]   when they allowed you to brand pages,
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.460]   is there's a fight over what I call the internet namespace.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.180]   And that's all this looks like to me.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.220]   These companies, Facebook, Twitter, I'm sure,
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.660]   Google, Yahoo, want to--
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.820]   probably Microsoft too-- would like to be your name.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.100]   So--
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.660]   Right, but it's a Betamax problem.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.740]   Tell me about that.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.700]   It's just too many different standards, too many different
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.500]   ways to go.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.220]   And we all just want to say, here I am, and off.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.780]   So at--
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.340]   This is my name.
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.540]   At Jeff Jarvis becomes your name.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.500]   At Gina Travani becomes your name.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.820]   And you don't bother with anything else.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.220]   That's it.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.180]   Yeah, it adds into my phone number
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.980]   and sip phone connections and connectivity
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.780]   and all kinds of other things.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.580]   But yeah, the name space and connectivity space
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.740]   and identity space, they're all related, but somewhat
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.860]   different, is wildly too confusing today.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.260]   Do you think, though, at some point,
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.780]   people will stop saying, oh, I've got this, this, this,
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.620]   and this, and we'll just say, I'm at Leo LePorte.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.460]   That's all you need to know.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.780]   You know, I feel so strongly that identity is built
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.460]   into the internet.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.060]   I know this is a really key thing to say,
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.020]   but for anyone who says they're trying to set up
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.420]   an internet presence, like for themselves, I say,
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.060]   register your domain name with your name,
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.420]   set up a web page, link it to wherever you are,
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.980]   and then whatever the social media do's your is,
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.180]   embed a widget or whatever.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.340]   But that, your name dot com is, oh, if as long as you maintain it
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.300]   and control it, is it going to be you?
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.900]   Here's the problem.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.380]   I can't get Leo LePorte dot com.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.060]   Someone else has it.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.500]   It's too late.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:44.980]   Definitely.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.740]   Well, there's definitely--
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   So then why?
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.860]   There are names based problems.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:47.380]   There are.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.020]   There are.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.100]   Well, so then you pick something else.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.500]   You do dot name or you do dot TV or you can't--
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.700]   or you throw in your middle name.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.860]   The identity thing is an issue.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.100]   I mean, my kids aren't definitely not
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.340]   going to get anything close to their name.
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.500]   So maybe at some point we're going to move to subdomains.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500]   But just--
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.180]   People are.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.740]   Parents are, by the way, searching.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.940]   Thinking for about names.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.980]   They're thinking about names.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.060]   I know many parents, modern parents, who won't name a kid
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.940]   something they can't get a unique, unique domain for.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.100]   By the way, I did register Abbey LePorte and HenryLePorte dot com,
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.220]   my kids' names.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:21.740]   So--
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.940]   For their warmer--
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.460]   No, a few years ago.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.900]   But I registered for 20 years or something like that,
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.700]   till they were 20.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.620]   And I figured if they don't pick it up after then,
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.140]   then that's their problem.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:32.620]   That's the problem.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.780]   We'll be able to find them.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.820]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.300]   I mean, then again, some people say to me, well, you're crazy.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.940]   I don't want this one place where I'm always going to be--
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.500]   that things are ephemeral and my identity
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.780]   is going to change from whatever--
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.100]   Well, it's just impractical.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.700]   I mean, can you really have?
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.660]   I mean, I guess that was the idea of dot name and dot me,
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.180]   right?
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:52.700]   Right.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.700]   That didn't work.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.180]   Didn't work.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.060]   Can every individual really have their own domain name?
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.620]   No.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.340]   Somebody's got leoloporte dot name.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.460]   Somebody's got leoloporte dot me.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:02.940]   So I'm so--
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.540]   Yeah, I'm trying to hold you up for it.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.740]   No, I'm sure that's coming.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.820]   Leoville is a pretty good domain, Leo.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.860]   Yeah, I got that a long time ago.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.580]   And I'm going to stick-- obviously, I'm going to stick with that.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.060]   But--
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.060]   Mm-hmm.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.060]   Mm-hmm.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.860]   But I think the point is that I think that we have to set--
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.300]   as far as I can come concerned, in terms of identity,
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.220]   you have to set up a place that you control that's
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.740]   on a space that you own.
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.140]   And you can-- you know what I mean?
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.260]   Because when Twitter goes away or when it's down or whatever
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.980]   or they turn evil or Facebook or whatever,
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.500]   you want to be able to say, this is where I am.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.420]   This is where I've been.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.620]   And this is where I'll always be,
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.140]   especially for people who work online.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.380]   You don't want it to be someone company.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.340]   You don't want Yahoo or Google to own it, right?
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.580]   You don't want Twitter to own it.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.020]   Yeah, absolutely not.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:46.860]   You don't.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.860]   You don't.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.260]   It's a perfect place for standards and interoperability.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.340]   And the ability to say, this equals this,
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.060]   and we can claim those things.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.140]   Right, right.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.380]   I mean, if you Google my name right now,
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.020]   Twitter is the second result, I think, after my name plate
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.220]   site.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.380]   So some companies are going to own it because people don't--
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.500]   a lot of people aren't like us.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.180]   They don't care enough to set up.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.540]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.780]   There's a bigger issue here, a societal issue here,
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.660]   about the benefits of identity.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.580]   I had a long conversation yesterday
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.020]   with a reporter who's doing a piece.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.980]   I won't give it up for her, but doing a piece on the nasty
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.380]   comments that come in her.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.180]   These two stories she wrote.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.780]   And I spent a long time trying to explain to her
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.820]   what Doc Serals taught me long ago
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.900]   is that, listen, you're trying to judge the internet
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.300]   in your media terms that everything
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.100]   is a package with a bow on it.
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.740]   And Doc says the internet is a place.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.700]   It's just a street corner where we talk.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:51.220]   And that in that, in trying to find new kinds of civility,
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.020]   requiring identity doesn't work.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.660]   But identity in Facebook and Twitter does work.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:02.140]   Those two are more civilized places than comment spheres,
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.860]   by far.
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.900]   Because we can follow people and not follow people
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.540]   because we value identity and relationships there.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.460]   And it changes the nature of the society there.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.900]   I think rather profoundly.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.140]   So there's huge benefit to identity online.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.620]   And that's why I resent all the more that I--
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.540]   we can't bring it together.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.700]   Yeah, so you have to swipe your card,
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.460]   re-log into Twitter to get on.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.620]   But to log on just to the web in general, you don't.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.060]   And yeah, and associating yourself with a handle
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.300]   and building a history and creating a social graph,
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.900]   it has its benefits in Twitter.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.460]   Is somebody at this advantage if they have a kid
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:43.540]   or they don't grab their name now?
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.540]   Are they at a disadvantage if they don't have lioloport.com?
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.820]   Well, I think, you know, if a kid's name is Bob Smith,
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.340]   they're just--
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.740]   They're never going to get it.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:54.860]   I think people are--
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.900]   Well, just not even--
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.820]   Not even-- just for Google Jews, just to be searchable.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.460]   You know, you can't name a kid Bob Smith anymore.
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.060]   So that's why I think people at Twitter and Facebook
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.900]   think we have-- and Google too, probably.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.620]   I think we have a very credible proposition.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.540]   A lot of people now, Facebook.com/lioloport,
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.380]   that's, you know, I got it.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.980]   That's how they want to do it, right?
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.100]   Is it not easier than registering a domain name?
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.780]   Yeah, I mean, that's a lot easier.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.100]   And Google profiles, right, will include like your name
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.420]   and your location and other bits of metadata, right,
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.700]   that identify you in search results anyway.
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.660]   But it's interesting to think of it because every place is
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.260]   going to have its page.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:41.780]   Right.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.980]   Well, that's the idea of the profiles, Google profiles,
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.300]   right?
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:44.980]   Right.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.660]   So, you know, the irony is, I think,
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.620]   here that locations are going to get better identity
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.420]   on the web than people are at first because of that,
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.380]   because they have geo.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.100]   Right.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.620]   Right.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.460]   But as a user, what happens when Google profiles gets pulled down
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.260]   or Facebook, you know, is in as popular?
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.300]   I mean, you invest all this time.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.820]   I mean, I guess that's always an issue,
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.420]   regard, you know, in addition to the SEO issue,
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.380]   the findability issue, the identity issue.
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.380]   I mean, that's an issue anyway.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.220]   But, you know, what happened to your Friendster profile page?
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.500]   What did happen to that?
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.140]   Is that a--
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.300]   Yeah, and I don't even know.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.580]   I don't even know if the domain is still working.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.060]   Let's see.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.260]   It's an interesting question.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:29.740]   Well--
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.260]   Wow, Friendster is-- there is--
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:31.260]   Sure.
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.900]   Friendster profile is up and around.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.700]   Hmm.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.300]   It's a-- but anyway, that's to me what
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.180]   ad anywhere is all about.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.300]   I mean, it seems like Twitter's answer to Facebook connect.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:43.820]   Right.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.340]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.020]   And Google Connect.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.100]   Writing, right.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.460]   Yep.
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.420]   Is it called Google Connect?
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.340]   I don't even know what Google--
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.180]   Google, what is it called?
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:52.740]   Google account.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.860]   Google, Google, Google sign in or--
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.740]   Isn't that Friend Connect?
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.660]   Oh, Friend Connect.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.060]   A little Friend Connect.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.980]   Yeah, that's what Kevin Marks had worked on.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.700]   Right.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.300]   Oh, right, right, right.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.820]   I mean, Kevin showed me a lot of very neat things
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.180]   that he was working on about being
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.260]   able to collect your trails, too,
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.700]   and being able to publish them anywhere.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.140]   Yeah, there's some working done--
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.060]   I think one of the--
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.420]   There is some work being done in that area, right?
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.620]   I want to say--
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.700]   I want to say salmon.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.140]   Salmon is the comment upstream, downstream, common existing.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.380]   Comment up, upstream, downstream.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:28.780]   OK.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.280]   OK.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.200]   It's just-- I think it's a very interesting thing.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.880]   And I think everybody's trying to figure out
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.520]   what's going to be the next land grab and doing what they can.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.880]   Everybody thought that Twitter would announce a plan
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.680]   for monetization.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.840]   And no, they didn't.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.760]   Or would be asked about it.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.280]   Was the keynote after our show--
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:47.800]   It was.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.880]   It was on Tuesday.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.200]   Maybe it was on Monday, I think.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.960]   And unfortunately, the questions that the moderator was
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.120]   asking were very softball.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.080]   We really didn't get much information.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:58.600]   Absolutely.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.960]   Uma-- Umaer Haik is a friend of mine,
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.120]   and is a brilliant guy.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.400]   But the talk-- people walked out like crazy.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   It's fascinating between this and the--
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.800]   Sarah Lacey--
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.280]   Sarah Lacey interface book.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.520]   It's a very hard thing to do with South by Southwest.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.760]   You've got to be aware of your audience
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.360]   and give the audience what they want, which
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.920]   is tough questions and geeky questions.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.200]   And otherwise, shut up.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.880]   Right.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.280]   And you've got some really hardcore people in there
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.720]   who are not afraid to tweet.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   That's a tough crowd.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.200]   If you don't grab a South by Southwest crowd
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.560]   within the first five minutes, they're
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.360]   going to leave on you.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.640]   Unless you're Gary Vee, who was definitely
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.200]   the best session I saw--
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:40.920]   Oh, really?
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.400]   --at weekends.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.800]   Oh, he's just such a dynamic speaker.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.000]   And just high energy, very engaged.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.520]   You got the audience involved instantly.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.280]   And he spoke for about 10 minutes, and I was like, OK, Q&A.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:51.720]   And then just--
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.920]   That's the way to do it, boy.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.000]   And two people got up and started spontaneously wrapping,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.440]   and the place was on their feet.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.200]   I mean, it was just--
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.720]   Yeah, people come up to hug over them.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.640]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.520]   Oh, that's really great.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.880]   And I like Gary.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.080]   I think he was in danger of becoming prerecorded about a year
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.440]   ago, where he heard the patcher in the spiel.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.880]   I didn't think that was true at all this time.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.120]   I think it was all the better that he did what Gina said,
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.240]   and just talked to people, and helped them, and advised them,
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.240]   and pushed them.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.080]   What was fascinating, too, is he wasn't all sunshine and flowers.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.640]   One woman got up and asked about her startup
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.680]   to enable companies to automatically answer
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.120]   brand questions on Twitter.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.720]   And he said, I hate that in every fiber of my soul.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.640]   Wow.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.560]   And she said, the woman said, well, but companies don't get it.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.480]   Then a woman from Procter & Gamble stood up and said,
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.680]   I'm from Procter & Gamble.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:41.920]   And I do--
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.800]   We get it.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.680]   And Gary said, well, but you have your agencies tweeting
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.160]   for you.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.520]   That's wrong.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.280]   Right.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.800]   He was very tough on her, too.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.000]   So it wasn't just as if he was doing platitudes from pillows.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.360]   He was really-- you don't talk into people.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.280]   Yeah, he was.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.520]   Platitudes from pillows, I like it.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   Speaking of which, I do have a Twit pillow now.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.960]   Thanks to throwboy.com.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.640]   No platitudes on it, but the logo.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.120]   Are you going to be selling it?
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.200]   Yeah, throwboy is going to sell it.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.160]   He came up to me at the Big Dig Shin Dig and said, here.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   I said, you want to make those, please do.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.720]   So I think throwboy is going to make it.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.480]   Yeah, isn't that cool?
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.840]   So while we were speaking, I covertly
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.680]   registered leo-l-port.moby-leo-l-port.name
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.480]   leo-l-port.net-leo-l-port.org.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.200]   Take that, leo-palooza.tv, just in case.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.520]   Wow.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.480]   So there.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.720]   And free pants.org.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.560]   You never know.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.320]   I should probably--
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.160]   I was like, I'm feeling--
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.200]   You're feeling very powerful.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.400]   Longest crowdsurf.org might be a good one, too,
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.960]   if I could steal that one.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.440]   If any of our listeners have not
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.800]   seen the Leo-l-appore Ignatian party crowd surfing video,
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.200]   get the e to YouTube instantly.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.680]   I don't think anybody has not seen it.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.000]   In fact, even today, if I look at Twitter,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.240]   at least three quarters of the mentions of me are that.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:58.760]   Are that?
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.120]   Best thing I ever did.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.480]   After swearing at Mike Arrington,
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.120]   that was the best thing I've ever done.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:04.960]   There you go.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.680]   There you go.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.760]   Jeez.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.640]   Jake's favorite thing-- son, Jake's favorite thing--
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.360]   was your tech person begging you not to on Twitter.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.600]   I missed that part.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.880]   Colleen said, don't do it.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.400]   Don't do it.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:15.900]   Don't do it.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.400]   Don't do it.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   Don't do it.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   Please don't do it, Leo.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.720]   Well, Colleen did not equip me with a Twitter readout on it,
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.200]   so there was no way to know what she was saying.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:24.720]   That's funny.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.280]   Well, she rightly so was probably worried about the gear.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.520]   She wasn't worried about me.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.400]   She was worried about the gear.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.440]   She was worried about the gear.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.680]   I didn't know if that was a euphemism.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.600]   Not that gear.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.400]   No, she was worried about the stuff on my back,
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.840]   the backpack, and the camera.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.320]   I'm sure that's what she was worried about.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.240]   That's funny.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.720]   It's kind of amazing that backpack made it.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.120]   I was stunned.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.880]   And it's funny because it streamed the whole crowd surfing.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.360]   And then I ran to get back up on stage and it fell out.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.760]   The connection fell out there.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.360]   So I was like, yeah.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.360]   I don't know.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.000]   Because you had an ethernet cord.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.920]   Oh, it was a firewire cable that just fell out at the drop of a hat.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.400]   So I was stunned that somebody up there was looking down.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.600]   And I also found out later that it is, in fact, a dangerous thing to do.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.440]   I didn't know.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.480]   But they dropped Meat Loaf at a crowd surf once.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.880]   And he landed on his elbow and injured himself.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.760]   Chris Meat Loaf was a rather big boy.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:21.280]   So the Nexus 1 is now-- we mentioned that for Roger's compatibility,
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.200]   they've made it so that it works with AT&T.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.360]   But now Sprint is saying it's going to have the Nexus 1.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.960]   Verizon is going to have the Nexus 1 probably this week.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.880]   So the Nexus 1-- is this going to be the next big phone, the Nexus 1?
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.480]   You guys use it.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:34.920]   I use it.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.520]   We're all three Nexus 1 users.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.280]   But then we hear that analysts were saying that the sales are
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.000]   disappointing.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.000]   Although there are a lot of Nexus 1s that sell to us.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.560]   I thought that was very interesting.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.320]   I'm sure the New Year's past it was all iPhone, right?
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:48.880]   Yep.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.160]   Everybody's staring at your iPhone.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.000]   There were a lot of droids.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.600]   Huge number of droids.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.800]   Yeah, I saw more droids, I think, than I saw Nexus 1s.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.920]   Yeah, and a few Nexus 1s.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.720]   But I think the Nexus 1 has been held back by T-Mobile.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.560]   That's part of it.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:08.680]   And I think that the apps still need some goosene.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.560]   There's some companies like New York Times
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.360]   really need to support it, I think.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   Mm.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.440]   Maybe, well, we'll see.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.960]   iPad's going to come out in a couple of weeks.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.040]   You guys, what do you think?
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.640]   Is that going to be--
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.560]   Is that going to help?
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.520]   I saw something that I fell in love with.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.720]   Did I tell you what this was?
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.480]   The Dell Mini 5?
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.840]   Yeah, that's really cute.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.040]   No, you didn't.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.800]   Yeah, you showed it to me.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.720]   Right, so you can find it online, Leo.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.480]   It's been written about.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.600]   But I saw it in person.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.520]   So rather, it's a middle point between the phone and the iPad.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.440]   It still fits in a pocket.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.240]   Oh, you did mention that, yes.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.520]   And it looks pretty big on the head.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.320]   But it's just that much bigger.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:54.640]   And so I think we're going to see Android pads of all sizes,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.680]   pardon the use of the--
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.000]   continues with the word Gina.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:04.400]   So it's just a little bit the Mini 5 or streak,
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.360]   as it's called by some.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.800]   It's just slightly bigger than the iPhone.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.160]   But that's pretty big.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.520]   But that's pretty big.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.040]   That's big enough to have a proper dock
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.680]   and to do a little more with the layout on the screen.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   And it is running Android.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.000]   And it's Android from a Dell.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.600]   I mean, it was impressive.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.640]   And I don't know what carrier they're going to put it on yet.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.560]   They just have the prototype there.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.880]   It was running AT&T there.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.960]   That might be just--
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.840]   that's the question is, what's the right size?
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.040]   That might just be just right.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   Yeah, although it does look dorky holding against your head.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.120]   But all the more reason to use your headset, I guess.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.520]   Could you fit in a breast pocket?
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.120]   Yes.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.640]   You could.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.640]   It's just--
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.120]   I tried and then tried to walk away with it.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.160]   Just big-- it's probably the limit.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.400]   I bet you that's what the deciding factor was.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.640]   Can I put a breast pocket?
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.040]   And is it Android 2.1?
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.240]   I can't tell from the pictures.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.320]   Looks like it might be.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.280]   I think it was.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.400]   The other thing was too, is that as you do things
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.720]   like look through your apps on the screen,
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.600]   just the functionality of having the larger screen is nice.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.720]   Which I'm sure will be part of the appeal of the iPad as well.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.840]   But so this opened my eyes to see that there's
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.320]   a lot of new devices coming here.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.200]   And Android's going to be the means--
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.360]   if you want to create a new device,
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.600]   you've got to do it on Android.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   You can't do it on Apple.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.640]   So that's where there's going to be tons of development.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.760]   And that is Google's hope.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.480]   Apples, I think, shooting itself in the foot
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.640]   by really asserting this closed marketplace.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.600]   I also wonder how much longer Apple's
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.120]   going to stay in the computer business.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.120]   Really?
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.560]   I'm going to say it's pretty clear that they can only--
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.680]   not only will Apple devices not multitask,
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.920]   it's pretty clear the company can't
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.800]   might multitask.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.400]   For instance, since January, Intel
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.040]   has had a new laptop chip that everybody and their brothers
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.880]   making laptops around the i3, 5, and 7, the Arendelle chip.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.960]   In the past, Apple's always jumped on these.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.080]   And in the fur effect, Intel's given them the pride of place.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.200]   They allowed them to be the first company to ship.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.240]   They did it with the i7.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.600]   Apple has three months in, and they have still not
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.760]   announced an Arendelle laptop line.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.360]   It's clear they're not going to do it now
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.840]   until after the iPad, maybe much after the iPad.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.840]   Can Apple do more than one thing at once?
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.760]   Interesting.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.280]   I hadn't really thought about that.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.880]   Not to be a total Google fan girl,
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.640]   but it always amazes me how Google releases products,
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.760]   after product, after product.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.640]   I mean, so obviously, they have so many different teams
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.920]   working on so many different things at one time.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.280]   But they realized the problem, too.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.120]   They just complained about apps versus Google,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.560]   Android versions versus this or that.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.400]   I think that's a problem for Google,
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.440]   and there's some kind of middle ground there.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.400]   Focus is not a bad thing.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:45.760]   Right.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.080]   Too much fragmentation.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.360]   Focus is not a bad thing.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   Which leads me to think that maybe Apple's having taken
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.280]   computer out of their name might take computer out
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.600]   of their product line.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.720]   They've gotten very successful products with the iProd.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.400]   I want to hug my computer right now, Leo.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.360]   But I haven't made you sad.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.200]   Go away.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.560]   I didn't make you sad, but--
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.680]   So Kevin Rose tweeted this week, "RIP Palm,
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.000]   they need to move to Android as fast as humanly possible."
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.680]   Very sad.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.920]   It's too bad, because WebOS, I think,
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.560]   is a nice operating system.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.720]   And I thought the pre was a very nice phone.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:26.480]   But they announced that in their Q3 call with Rubenstein,
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:31.440]   they announced that their losses were significantly higher
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.240]   than analysts predicted.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.560]   The market immediately punished them
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.600]   by dropping their stock price by 28%.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.800]   It doesn't look good for the next quarter.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.880]   Either his advisory for the next quarter
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.360]   was a widely increased losses.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.880]   Sales are not good on the pre.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.000]   You've got to wonder how much longer Palm can hold on.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.720]   And I don't think shifting to Android
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.800]   is going to do anything for them at this point.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.840]   I think they're out of business.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.640]   It's very meaningful.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.840]   Yeah, they created this category in a lot of ways.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.520]   And I think WebOS was good.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.720]   You know what Palm did exactly what
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.040]   I would have done in their position, which is scrap everything,
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.000]   steal the entire iPhone team, give them free rein
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.440]   to do something better.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.760]   They did all of that.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.440]   So what happened?
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.240]   What went wrong?
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.200]   Too late?
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.960]   Sprint.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.840]   Probably.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.760]   Nobody's going to buy it.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   I mean, it's too little--
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.560]   What's the iPhone?
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.600]   Only iPhone's in IT&T.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.480]   Nobody wants Sprint.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.600]   Do you think-- I mean, Sprint is really
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.840]   an also ran as a carrier.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.040]   So that's one problem.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.600]   That's problem one.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:44.400]   They have 2,000 applications in the App Store, not 40,000,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.760]   not 140,000.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.880]   That's a problem.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.680]   You got to get developers.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.880]   You got to be-- well, I mean, it's a catch 22.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.960]   You've got to get people to buy it.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.920]   So the developers have developed for it.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.760]   But developers aren't going to develop for it
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.800]   if people don't buy it.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.560]   And people aren't going to buy it unless they see apps.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.080]   And unfortunately, Palm was too small a company
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.640]   to develop enough apps.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.760]   Maybe they should have gone Android in the first place.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   Kevin might be right that the mistake was going to WebOS
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.200]   at all.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.320]   But now I think it's too late to go to Android.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.680]   I was just looking at PDA net and thinking, God,
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.600]   I haven't called these things PDAs in APS.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.760]   That's what really killed them.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.880]   The smartphone marketplace just put them out of business.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.040]   It's interesting because Microsoft's response-- now,
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.080]   they're a much bigger company.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.280]   They have a lot more resources.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.320]   Windows 7 phone system, whatever the hell they call it,
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.360]   is a real shot across the Android bow.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.000]   I don't know if it's going to be enough.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.480]   But a lot of people saw Windows, the new Windows 7,
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.520]   at Mix this week at the Microsoft Mix Conference.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.160]   And we're very impressed by it.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.920]   Interesting, though.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.440]   Limited multitasking, no cut and paste.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.480]   It sounds a little familiar.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.360]   They'll never learn.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.280]   Sounds a little familiar.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.520]   I heard some good things about IE9 coming from people
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.760]   following on Twitter.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.760]   Very fast.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:14.080]   They did a developer preview that had no Chrome and had no UI.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.440]   But the engine was there.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.800]   And the engine everybody's saying is extraordinarily fast.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:24.320]   And props to Microsoft HTML5 looking forward to HTML5.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.200]   Yay.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   Finally.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.440]   And Microsoft just needs to put IE6 and IE7 in bed.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.920]   They just need to force the upgrade.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.080]   They just have to tell people we're done.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.600]   No more.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.440]   I think they're moving in that direction.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.240]   This has always been Microsoft's most difficult challenges
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.000]   is that unlike some companies, Apple particularly,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.040]   they cannot and are not willing to,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.160]   and probably shouldn't, cut off legacy users.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.680]   And so while they'd very much like to say, sorry,
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.040]   we're going to reach out and uninstall IE6 for each
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.560]   and every one of your computers, they can't do that.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.680]   Because their primary customer base is business.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.800]   And business is notoriously slow to adopt new stuff.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   You've got to keep the old stuff working.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.360]   Or business is just going to abandon you.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.240]   So Microsoft has to support all this old stuff.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.520]   And that's really what hurts them.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.360]   It's what hurts their security.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.400]   They can't abandon the old models because they've
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   got to work with all the old stuff.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.560]   But don't you feel like these refresh cycles have to speed up?
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.760]   I mean, or else--
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.480]   I mean, they have to speed up, right?
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.960]   Businesses have to get faster about this.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.260]   And Microsoft has to be a little more
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.840]   insistent and assertive about it, I think.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.680]   They have that luxury.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.720]   I think that this is the price of success.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.200]   But it's bigger than it is an architectural issue.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.560]   I mean, it's the closed world.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.920]   If you have to update it, you're the only one who updates it
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.840]   versus the open world where it's constantly iterating.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.680]   That's Microsoft's death.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.520]   It's the word--
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.800]   you know, the interesting we talk about this,
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.640]   because it's the word processors died, PDAs died.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.880]   Microsoft isn't dying, but it's stuck in the same rut
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.200]   where its closed world became--
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.760]   its barrier to entry to others became its disadvantage.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.200]   Same as in media.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.720]   I own the press, you don't.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.080]   I had this huge expense.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.920]   It now becomes an albatross around your neck.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.560]   Retailers who have huge investment in bricks and mortar
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.800]   used to be their advantage, barrier to entry.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.400]   Now it's the albatross.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.680]   Microsoft's closed system that made it a--
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.240]   someone would say monopoly is now its burden.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.360]   But I think it happens to everybody in the long run.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.040]   Google may be the first company to say, oh, look,
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.040]   we can succeed openly and maybe not have that problem.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.200]   I think there'll be other problems.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.720]   But--
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.240]   Interesting.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.240]   Well, they have much less of the problem
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.560]   to reach down at people's computers and update their software.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.160]   I mean, it's all iterating web app is a completely different.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.080]   But look at the problem they have with phones.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.680]   There are some phones that are 1.5.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.000]   There's some phones that are 2.1.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.400]   People who bought 1.5 phones are pissed off.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:50.920]   That's true.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.280]   There's another side of that story.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.200]   That's true.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.360]   You've got five different platforms out there.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:56.860]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.440]   And it would be interesting to see what happens with Chrome OS,
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.680]   because there are going to be certain netbooks that they
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.480]   support and updates and that kind of thing.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.200]   And yet there'll be people like Hexa,
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.080]   who will do builds for anything.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.240]   Yep.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.280]   You lose control.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.920]   So what's the business strategy then in this world?
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.160]   Web apps.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:16.520]   Right.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.080]   So you don't want barriers to entry anymore.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.040]   So you have web apps, right?
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.800]   Because web apps, you control the version.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.360]   You have absolute control of the software.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.680]   And that's why I'm sure why Google's pushing Google Apps.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:32.040]   Because then that's an ecosystem you can completely control.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.280]   And but you're also set up to be advantaged if someone
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.680]   invents something you didn't invent.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.360]   Perfect, the app marketplace.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.480]   That's exactly it.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.480]   Where by being closed, you had to invent it.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.000]   Right.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.800]   So you get two really good, strong things going in your favor.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.320]   And it's interesting, because Microsoft
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.520]   is very much trying to be a cloud company.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.080]   But boy, they hired Ray Aussie, the creator of Lotus.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   That was not a cloud thing.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.120]   Lotus was an ultimate closed system.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:02.960]   That's the problem.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.240]   It just extended that architecture.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.240]   That's a good point.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.720]   And I still make fun of Howard Stern,
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.320]   where every time he has to sync to Lotus,
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.600]   how often do you hear that anymore?
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.120]   Geez.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.400]   Seriously?
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:14.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.120]   Somebody at the end got talked to me a few years ago,
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.240]   and now he's stuck with it.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.120]   And you just-- I just don't hear that anymore.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.320]   It's like Microsoft Exchange, but worse.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.720]   He says it on the air?
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.560]   This is for her.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.360]   Yeah, he does, yeah.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.080]   We need to have a little talk, can I?
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.880]   You want to sound like her from 1998 or what?
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.960]   Just I got to tease Howard.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:40.320]   Come on.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   Of course.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:41.820]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.320]   Howard doesn't-- he's not worried about anything.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.040]   When I tried to talk him into the iPhone the first time,
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:45.640]   he finally got it.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.720]   He couldn't because it didn't have an exchange.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.600]   I mean, a Lotus sync.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.840]   Oh, that's so sad.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.040]   It did?
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.640]   Who uses Lotus?
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.960]   Sirius?
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.520]   Howard?
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.320]   No, just Howard.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:56.840]   Just Howard.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.440]   Just Howard?
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.160]   He's using up.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.560]   It was a great curse of working for Ziff Davis in the late '90s
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.360]   was that they had to have Lotus.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.920]   You had to use Lotus.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.200]   Lotus Notes is the worst piece of--
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.440]   So this is Howard's company that's using Lotus.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.160]   So Howard can say, hey, we've got to move to something else,
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.560]   and he hasn't done it yet?
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.040]   Yeah, he's a creature of habit.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:23.440]   But yeah, he has this IBM tech guy who installed his machines
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.920]   and gave him the machines he has to go.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.960]   And as a result, he's been addicted,
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.040]   and he can't break out of it.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.120]   What's going to be addicted to?
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   What I'm going to do?
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.880]   It's just this mess, a Lotus crap all over.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   You know, you ought to get him a genie account or MCI mail.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.000]   Then he'd feel at home.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.760]   So you--
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.280]   I was listening to Howard best of because he's
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.960]   off this week as he has many weeks.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   And they had a segment on Howard used to go do online sex
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.320]   at CompuServe back in the day.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.240]   And they had one of his paramores from CompuServe
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.640]   in who was not as he'd imagined her.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.200]   Oh, dear.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.120]   Oh, dear.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.040]   That was that.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.240]   That's a good bit.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:07.760]   It was a good bit.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.560]   That's funny.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.000]   But it shows how the world's changed.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.360]   I remember my 75106, 3135 on CompuServe.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.160]   714351134.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.800]   You never forget.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.320]   Jesus, look at us.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.800]   Like, research research.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   Jeez.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.000]   None had one of those.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Dad.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.560]   I also have an MCI mail address.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.040]   I was Elle Laporte at MCI mail.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:35.680]   But MCI--
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.920]   Yeah, I think I was like teacher planning 2000 on MCI.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:38.940]   OK, OK.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:39.760]   I can get it on this game.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.640]   But you could never email anybody else.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.840]   You could only email MCI mail users.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.760]   It was crazy.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.240]   You have a source account to live.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.040]   I had the source.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:47.760]   I had CompuServe.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.480]   I had genie.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.600]   And I'm all quantum link.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.920]   Crazy.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:43:00.520]   So a great-- thanks to the Viacom Google lawsuit.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.840]   A great-- we're starting to see some revelations.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.800]   Jeff Bookmarked an article at financialadvisory.com.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.040]   Secrets of Google YouTube deal reveal.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:19.360]   Now, I knew one secret because we interviewed Chad Hurley
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.160]   after the acquisition.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.800]   And he told us that when Google was talking to them,
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.320]   they wanted to keep a top secret.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.840]   So he met with Eric Schmidt at the International House
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.680]   of Pancakes in Mountain View.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.920]   And that's where they hashed out the details.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.760]   But now we're learning what the details were.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.360]   In a chocolate chip pancake stoop--
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.920]   I don't know what they had.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.720]   Did you have the strawberries with the whipped cream?
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.120]   Obviously, Eric Schmidt did.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.080]   Did you love those fantasy?
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.080]   Obviously, Eric Schmidt did.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.520]   Because according to this, Eric Schmidt
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.440]   said the company was valued when they offered $1.65 billion
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.320]   for YouTube was valued at $700 million.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:01.160]   They offered a $1 billion premium on the company.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.800]   He said that the time factor was the reason why they needed
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.000]   to get it now.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.640]   Chad Hurley got $334 million in Google stock.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.480]   I would love the calculation of what that's worth today.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.480]   Oh, a lot more, right?
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.080]   I'm sure that's--
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:18.600]   That has to be.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.000]   10 times more.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.160]   Steve Chen, $301 million in stock.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.080]   Yawwood Karim, $66 million in stock.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.680]   Sequoia Capital, one of their chief investors,
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:37.880]   got half a billion dollars in Google stock.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.920]   Man.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.720]   That's why I want to be a venture capitalist.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.280]   They picked up the tab at IHP.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.600]   They put in $9 million.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:52.360]   And they got $516 million two years later.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.320]   Wow, good for that.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.000]   Artist Capital Management put in $3 million,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.320]   got $85 million.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.080]   But it was risky.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.880]   I mean, investing in YouTube was crazy.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.640]   Oh, people thought it was nuts.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.680]   A million dollars a month in bed with everybody screamed,
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.240]   this is your insane internet.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.600]   It's never going to work.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.920]   Not to mention the lawsuits.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.120]   We interviewed Chad right before the Google sale.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.840]   And I said, dude, what are you going to do when NBC, CBS,
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.280]   and ABC try to sue you out of existence?
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.760]   And he just smiled.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.680]   My favorite part of the Viacom suit
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.240]   is that part of what the Google lawyers have revealed here
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.440]   is that even as Viacom was saber rattling and suing,
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.840]   they were secretly uploading their own content to you.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.400]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.360]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.560]   Love that.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.040]   Google has hand--
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:41.800]   Go ahead.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:46.400]   Oh, so I think this life goes ties into the Google TV box
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.960]   now because it does show the grander strategy here.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   Which is--
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.880]   --the Google TV.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.320]   Oh, let's talk about that.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.120]   New strategy here.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.120]   And I think YouTube does tie right into that.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.320]   It makes bigger sense.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.640]   So what is-- so we're hearing now more about Google TV.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.960]   We talked about last week the fact
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.280]   that they were doing a test with Dish using Google employees
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.040]   to do search and so forth.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.560]   Now we know a little bit more.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.200]   There's a set top box, right, Gina?
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.000]   Set top box, Android based.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.800]   It's Google, Intel, and Sony.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.320]   And this is from the New York Times article.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.840]   The partners in Vision Technology
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.480]   that will make it as easy for TV users
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.160]   to navigate web applications, like the Twitter social network
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.480]   and Picasa Photo site, as it is to change the channel.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.160]   So web content on the set top box--
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.000]   We've seen so many companies founder on the rocks of this.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:36.400]   Yep, it's true.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.480]   From Microsoft to Apple to everybody on down.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.520]   This is a very hard thing to do.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.960]   Yahoo widgets allow this right now.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.600]   And nobody wants to tweet on their big screen
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.520]   with what they're remote control.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.120]   No, no, no.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.880]   You don't want that for me.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.640]   But there are a lot of developers out there who
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.000]   want to do a custom build of Android
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.040]   that will automate your BitTorrent and use that and Netflix
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:00.680]   and whatever.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:05.240]   I mean, this is going to be the ultimate media center
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.520]   operating system for your first brand.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.720]   You're the changes of your leg irons tied to the cable
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.960]   company falling off you.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.600]   That's what this is about.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.360]   OK.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:16.840]   Right?
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.760]   If you can get-- if you have bandwidth
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:26.480]   and you can access to most TV with ease, that's it.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.000]   Right?
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.520]   And you'll still pay for HBO.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.080]   Fine.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.280]   But does it have to come through the cable box?
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.080]   Well, for now it will because they've got wrap up agreements.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:43.440]   But the more programming that goes free of the cable MSOs,
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.400]   and much of it's being done from the cable companies,
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.920]   the more this strategy can work.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.520]   Oh, man.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.600]   But imagine the lawsuits.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.680]   I mean, you're basically building a gigantic piracy device.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.320]   No, you're not.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.200]   You're just-- and it's an access device.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.120]   Right?
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.880]   That happens to have built BitTorrent.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.920]   Well, if I can find TV anywhere, which
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   is the Comcast and Time Runner structure,
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.200]   if I can find Hulu, if I can find--
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.120]   Stences.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.440]   --Twit and Twig.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.760]   If I can find YouTube, if I can get to any of this stuff
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.640]   in the post-scheduled TV world, then that's the goal.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.840]   And that's what Roku wants to do.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.240]   And it's what others want to do as well.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.440]   But they don't have the clout that Google has here.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:25.960]   Right.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.960]   Right.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:27.960]   So, Google has a lot of this--
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.280]   --attached to that video.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.920]   That's part of the key.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:33.800]   Sorry, Gina.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:34.520]   No, no, that's OK.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.020]   That's OK.
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.200]   I mean, I was going to say, who else has done this?
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.720]   So Apple TV, Roku, Tivo, to some extent.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.040]   Yeah, there's Windows Media Center.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:40.480]   There's also--
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.680]   Like the software, there's like Boxy and XBMC and those kinds
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   of-- but this feels like it could
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.400]   be the best of all those things because it's got Google behind it.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   It's got that huge cloud.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.160]   It's got the leverage to make some deals.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.160]   And it's Android-based, which is the fact that it's open.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.120]   XBMC and Boxy are some of the best media center
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.160]   software available as far as I'm concerned.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.120]   No, they're fantastic.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:03.640]   So, yeah.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.880]   So I consider this too.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.200]   So, fine, you've got the iPad on one size
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.440]   with its closed deals in world.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.240]   So I take the Dell Mini 5 Android-based with this Google
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.240]   software on it, and I can watch anything that's
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.680]   available there in a pad device.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.400]   Apple has its closed deals with a certain number
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:27.320]   of magazine publishers, newspapers, and TV producers.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.720]   I get the rest of the world.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.360]   Here's the problem.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.560]   The premium content providers are not
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.120]   going to want to play with a box like this
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.000]   because it does open up the door to piracy.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.280]   They're scared to death of it.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.080]   No, no, Leo, but they are playing already.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.080]   That's what the TV Anywhere Thing means is that as long as I
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.640]   have the web, I will be able to watch the HBO shows I've paid
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.160]   for.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.520]   But the reason that works is because HBO and Time Warner,
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   in that case, or Comcast, in the case of Extentsis,
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.000]   have this kind of close relationship,
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.680]   and you have to be a subscriber.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.960]   They got your MP address.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.160]   They got it locked down.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.520]   You're going to stream it to me only,
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.880]   but you stream it on demand.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.800]   Try and save it.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.800]   That's fine.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   OK.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.080]   Of big bandwidth, if I could figure out what the FCC did
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.800]   last week with bandwidth, we really had 100 meg
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.960]   and had 100 meg wireless.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.840]   Who needs anything other than streaming?
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.440]   I don't need to store things locally.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.080]   If I'm online on the plane, I don't
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.040]   need to store things locally.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.800]   The plane is the last frontier of the need for a hard drive.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.320]   Right.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:30.000]   Let's talk about the FCC.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.040]   It's called the National Bandwidth Plan or Strategy
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.560]   here, Broad National Broadband Plan.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.560]   They want to take-- one of the things
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:44.720]   I want to do is take back spectrum from broadcasters
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.920]   and use that spectrum for kind of wireless anywhere.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   Right?
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.240]   I think this is a sensible thing,
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.200]   because frankly, the commercial ISPs just
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.720]   aren't going to see any value in streaming wire out
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.000]   to the rural users.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.720]   So that makes sense.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.160]   And then they want to increase our broadband to 100 megabits,
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.480]   somehow, some magically.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.640]   10 years.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.640]   Somehow, magically.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.960]   10 friggin' years.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.880]   Why do we have to wait so long?
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.840]   It's available in other countries today.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.200]   Well, I think this is why Google is doing all of this
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.280]   with its gigabit point.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.080]   They got a lot--
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.160]   They got a lot of attention on that one.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.040]   I mean, and by the way, a little later on,
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.560]   we're going to talk to a member of my local city council
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.360]   about what my town is doing.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.240]   And I think there's towns all over the country who are just
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.200]   slathering-- I don't know how they're going to choose a town.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:42.160]   But they're going to do five towns that get this gigabit
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.200]   internet service.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:50.480]   So the National Broadband Plan doesn't mention open access.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.400]   No, that's the other big issue, is that because you
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.320]   don't have open access, the belief is we won't have the
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.920]   competition needed to push this law.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:03.600]   FCC has really stuck its claws into internet in the past with
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.080]   very negative effects.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.080]   For one of the reasons, for instance, that there are
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:10.040]   monopolies in the cable company and the phone companies
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.880]   is because they were awarded-- essentially awarded
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:16.800]   monopolies, duopolies, for internet access.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.640]   And I guess the FCC at the time believed that was necessary
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.880]   to get them to lay the cable.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.880]   But now, there's no incentive to improve on the copper.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.880]   Physical plant, they've got to amortize the cost.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.800]   And so there is no incentive on the incumbents to increase
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:34.880]   the speed, which is what Google's trying to do is
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.880]   take that loose.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.840]   Well, that's the end of Google.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:36.840]   Come in.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.640]   Google pushed for openness in the auction for spectrum.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:40.520]   That's why they did it.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.240]   And that's why they got some foot in the door on that.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:48.280]   Google's now going to push for market-based 100 megabit.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.680]   Google's going to just push past this.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.720]   Now, Eric Schmidt did write-- and I put this on the
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:55.360]   friend feed-- did write a post on the official Google blog
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.760]   kind of craziness, but it's rather a political move.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.240]   One of the things the FCC's going to do that I think might
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.880]   help put pressure on internet service providers, they're
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.880]   going to collect and publish data.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.560]   You can download an application that you can run that will
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.440]   then post it to the government.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.800]   And the government is then going to have an FCC broadband
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:22.640]   performance chart that tells you who the sucky guys are.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.960]   And you could plug in your address and see everybody who
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.800]   offers service and who offers the best service.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.640]   So they're really going to kind of improve the marketplace.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.640]   The problem is they've approved these duopoles, so most
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.920]   places will have two choices-- the phone company and the
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.560]   cable company.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.120]   There'll be no magic third choice.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:46.240]   Well, that's where, again, Google comes in by pushing for
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.200]   the white spaces in the broadcast spectrum as super
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:50.720]   Wi-Fi.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.040]   Wi-Fi on steroids, as they say.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.120]   But the key thing we must have is competition.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:57.480]   Yes.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.240]   That's the problem.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:58.800]   And that's correct.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.760]   And in neutrality, there's a very smart guy named Tom
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.680]   Evelyn, who--
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.040]   Did I ever mention him on the show?
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   I don't think so, no.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.760]   Evelyn is, to my mind, the unsung hero of the internet
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.640]   because he was in charge of AT&T WorldNet when he decided
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.440]   to drop the clock and go to flat rate 1995 and month
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:16.120]   pricing.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.880]   And when the clock turned off, we all said, oh, let's
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.840]   explore this thing as opposed to hearing the tick tick tick
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:25.640]   of ching, ching, ching, going by.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:30.280]   Epsilon then went on to found the first arbitrage market for
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.000]   VoIP.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.600]   And then he said some things about regulation.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.920]   And his argument about net neutrality is, it's a
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.440]   temporary need.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.520]   We wouldn't need the regulation.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.600]   We had competition.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.760]   We wouldn't need it, absolutely.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:42.240]   Absolutely.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.120]   Which is why it's not a good-- really not a good
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:44.800]   solution.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.800]   Just promote competition.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.320]   And that's kind of what this national broadband plan is
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:53.840]   supposed to do, is to promote competition.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:55:00.720]   Schmidt's post on the Google blog so that he supports this
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.520]   because ubiquitous broadband connectivity can catapult
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.040]   American to the next level of economic competitiveness,
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.240]   worker productivity, educational opportunity.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.280]   Amen, brother.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.120]   Well, I've been saying this for a long time.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.400]   We need to kind of policy like we did in the depression
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:17.960]   with rural electrification, where the government gets behind
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.920]   the fact that we all need universal access to broadband
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.480]   services and makes it possible.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:28.080]   They have a Connect America fund that to support the
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.560]   provision of affordable broadband and voice with at least
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:36.960]   four megabits actual download speeds nationwide.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.760]   Got to be behind that.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.680]   A mobility fund to provide targeted funding to ensure no
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.960]   states are lagging significantly behind the national
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:47.560]   average for 3G wireless.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.760]   I think this all looks good.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.040]   I mean, it really--
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.160]   it's going to depend on where the rubber hits the road.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.000]   What actually happens?
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.600]   But I mean, I all see anything here that I would argue
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.240]   against.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.800]   Every American should have affordable access to
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.360]   robust broadband service and the means and skills to
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.920]   subscribe if they so choose.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.640]   Did I talk about this postal guy I talked to last
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:09.840]   week?
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.640]   Fewies come.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.720]   There's not even John Callan.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.880]   He found me out of nowhere because he read my book,
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.040]   wasn't a plug.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:19.800]   And he was at a meeting of postal people, Ruth Goldway,
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.880]   the head of the now the head of the Postal Rate
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.960]   Commission, which oversees the Postal Service, was asked
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.040]   at a meeting, what would Google do if it had the
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.840]   post office?
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:28.840]   And she had read my book.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.080]   He gave her a copy.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.000]   She said Google would give everyone in America a
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.080]   computer and a printer.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.080]   Right.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.400]   Who needs mail?
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:41.960]   If we had that, if we did make that a national strategy,
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.000]   what all falls out of that?
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.040]   It's awesome what happens.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:46.480]   You don't need a postal service anymore.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.360]   You don't need newspapers anymore.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.160]   You change the entire nature of education and of
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:55.960]   publishing and of retail if we had ubiquity of
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.400]   connectivity in this country.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.800]   Schmidt calls it the space race, but the space race
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.880]   was just to make a few advances in the far end of
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.440]   technology.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.440]   This makes such difference.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.840]   This is the interstate system.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.000]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:08.680]   This is indoor plumbing.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.720]   It's infrastructure.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.640]   Yes.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:11.160]   Definitely.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:11.760]   Six goals.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.400]   Goal one to at least at least 100 million US homes
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:18.000]   should have affordable access to actual download speeds of
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.160]   at least 100 megabits a second.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.760]   Actual upload speeds.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.040]   I love this.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.840]   Of 50 megabits.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.920]   Yeah, upload.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:29.080]   This is where you're seeing a guy like Julius
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.240]   Jannikowski who worked in--
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.640]   he did startups.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.960]   He worked in the tech business.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.520]   This guy knows what he's talking about.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.120]   He's leading the FCC from a point of view of not of
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.720]   ignorance but of knowledge.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.160]   And boy, you see a huge difference.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:47.080]   When you say we want upload speeds of 50 megabits,
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.800]   that makes everybody a publisher.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:49.320]   Right.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.880]   Goal two, the United States should lead the world in
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.320]   mobile innovation with the fastest and most extensive
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.520]   wireless network of any nation.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.040]   By the way, these are long--
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.720]   these are proposed long-term goals.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.040]   I don't know.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.760]   I guess Congress would have to--
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.440]   I don't know.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.720]   These are lofty sentiments.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.600]   I don't know how you make it happen.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.240]   Goal three, I mentioned every American affordable access.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.800]   Goal four, every American community--
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.720]   I love this.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.120]   Every American community should have affordable access
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:17.200]   to at least one gigabit per second broadband to anchor
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.040]   institutions like schools, hospitals, and
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.960]   government buildings.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.080]   To ensure the safety of the American people,
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.560]   every first responder should have access to a nationwide
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:30.120]   wireless interoperable broadband public safety network.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:30.840]   Amen.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:31.840]   Wow.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.120]   Can't argue with any of this.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.560]   Goal six, to ensure that America leads in the clean
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.600]   energy economy, every American should be able to use
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.160]   broadband to track and manage their real-time energy
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:40.600]   consumption.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.320]   Somebody tacked that one on.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:43.320]   That's a cool one.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.280]   And it's green.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:49.400]   Now, OK, now I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.520]   Within the next three years, we're going to have major
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:55.680]   cyber warfare incursions into a lot of infrastructure.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.680]   We're going to have collapses.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.600]   We're going to have the equivalent of terrorist attacks
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:03.520]   on our nationwide cyber infrastructure, which is going
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.400]   to cause a complete shutdown and closed system.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.080]   And the government's going to step forward and do the
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.440]   effectively do the Patriot Act for the internet.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.800]   And all of these lofty goals are going to go by the wayside
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.840]   because we can't afford them.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.000]   Aren't you the ray of sunshine?
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.440]   What a downer, Leo.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.360]   We are not prepared for this.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.440]   And this is going to happen.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.600]   And we are-- this-- you know, I admire this.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.280]   I really admire these six goals.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.800]   And I think they should happen.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.400]   But you know, we've got a bigger problem.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:36.080]   We have the most-- our infrastructure is absolutely
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.240]   vulnerable.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:41.640]   And we have made no concerted effort to protect ourselves.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.560]   Basically, our heads are in the sand.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:44.720]   But this is how it works, right?
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.480]   You get attacked.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:46.080]   You shore up.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.760]   You get attacked.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:52.960]   This is how networks become secured, right?
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.680]   Don't you feel like it's an arms race?
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:55.040]   No.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.000]   In some extent, don't you feel like security often happens
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.080]   in response to attacks?
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.320]   Or do you feel like proactively?
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.640]   I think the real problem is the interdependence that we have
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.960]   now and the utter dependence and interdependence we have
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.160]   makes us so vulnerable that an attack could have devastating
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:14.960]   impact, nothing that you could recover from.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.440]   Well, making-- yes.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.480]   Not making everything under--
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.240]   We are relying--
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.360]   we are now relying on the kindness of strangers.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.760]   Well, and those strangers are the Chinese.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.680]   And they wish us ill.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.600]   There is a piece-- may I do this, Julio?
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.160]   There is a piece in the Chinese--
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:41.320]   China Daily from the Xinhua news agency that is on the
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.800]   friend feed feed.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.240]   It is the party line propaganda on Google and China, as Google
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.720]   prepares to potentially pull out next week, or it is pull
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.600]   out of censored search.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.240]   And it's fascinating to read because it says that first
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.480]   Google claims without any evidence the government--
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.560]   the Chinese government supported these hackers' attacks
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.560]   against it.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.560]   It's threatened to pull out of the Chinese market where the
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.120]   government doesn't compromise on internet regulations.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.000]   American politicians and government institutions spoke up
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.760]   to back up the company and show the world a slapstick
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.560]   commentary.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.920]   The most amazing thing to be recognized--
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.600]   says China, no country will allow information about some
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.840]   version, separation, racialism, and terrorism to circulate
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.040]   in it through the internet.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.640]   Poverty in borders.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.080]   Sovereignty in borders also exist in cybersmosis.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.400]   No, they do not.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.120]   A man which will need to be watched by each country's laws
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:38.960]   and regulation.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.560]   This is the real war.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.480]   You know what you're seeing?
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.720]   You're seeing a pissing war.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.920]   But the Chinese cannot act unilaterally.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.040]   They have such a huge investment in the US economy that
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.920]   they can't just say, we're going to make it this way.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.840]   I mean, they have the power, I guess, to do so.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.160]   But their economy relies on the robustness of our economy
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.040]   at this point.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.560]   I know.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.400]   But they also--
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.080]   It's mutually assured discussion.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.720]   Well, that's the question.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.920]   Here's the great line.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.200]   It is a great pity that the Google case told us the company's
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.240]   aim of entering the Chinese market seems not
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.400]   for commercial reasons, but to act as a tool to penetrate
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.280]   into the Chinese culture as well as into Chinese people's
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:22.840]   values.
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.920]   Yes, they're running dogs of capitalists.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.600]   So it is a modernism fight, too.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.280]   It's not to get controversial and get us bombed,
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.400]   but it also goes into the discussion about parts
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.160]   of the Middle East as well and the Chinese government.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.160]   And it's about freedom versus the lack of freedom.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.080]   We're fighting over nothing less.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:41.520]   Right.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.960]   And yet, it's not weapons of mass destruction
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.080]   that are going to be the real problem here.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.400]   It's a cyber warfare.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.280]   And the Chinese have shown a willingness
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.480]   to use these tools.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.040]   And--
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.560]   I think I'm going to go build a bunker tonight.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.080]   Yes, seriously.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.680]   I hate to be a doubter.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.720]   That's their petaluba.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.640]   I hate to be a doubter, but truthfully, all I see
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.840]   is increasing dependence on cyber technology
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.360]   and interdependence.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.800]   And frankly, it seems to me-- and I
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.400]   haven't seen any evidence to the contrary--
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.560]   that it's a house of cards that is just not very robust.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.840]   I mean, Gina, you're a programmer.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.800]   You know how hairy this all is.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.400]   Uh-huh.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:23.840]   Uh-huh.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.400]   And it's impossible to secure.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.440]   And so I think truthfully what will happen--
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.680]   I think these are the kinds of lofty sentiments
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.080]   this international broadband plan.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.120]   Kind of lost these sentiments you have as you had in the '60s.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.880]   We're going to launch a man to the moon.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.080]   And then the reality sits in.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.360]   And by the way, we don't have any money to go to anywhere else.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.440]   We're going to stay here now that we've done that.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.720]   And I have a feeling-- I just have a feeling that in years
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.920]   to come, we're going to say, well, yeah, this would be nice.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.040]   But really, what we better do is make sure that all of you
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.640]   have rigidly controlled internet access.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.160]   Out.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.720]   Total security is not possible.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.720]   It's not possible.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.640]   It's not possible.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.840]   It's a myth.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.960]   There's no way to completely secure a network.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960]   But there are ways to monitor and to make things
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.240]   and to build things in a certain way that make them more
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:12.680]   secure.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.800]   And I'm certainly not an expert.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.320]   And there's the Jonathan Zittrain argument
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.880]   that you kind of have-- even in your own machine,
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.400]   you have a bifurcated, open and closed world
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.440]   so that you have something you do know is secure
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.880]   and something that is open and less harmful.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.880]   But don't you think we are moving-- and maybe we
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.120]   are part of the problem.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.840]   We're moving everybody towards this open world
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.920]   and not reminding them to keep part of their stuff safe
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.880]   and private.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.400]   But the irony is what gets attacked most.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.600]   Microsoft's closed worlds.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.680]   Well, that's just because it's a big-- no,
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.200]   it's just because it's a big public facing target.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.520]   That's all.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.080]   It gets attacked because that's where the money is.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.880]   Same reason why you're setting Rob the bank.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.560]   I mean, that's just where the money is stored.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.880]   And in fact, it's a more difficult place,
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.720]   a more difficult surface to attack.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.640]   That doesn't deter anybody.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.320]   As long as there's something inside that safe,
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.280]   they're going to attack the safe.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.600]   As soon as you start putting your goodies in somewhere
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.320]   less secure, well, you're wide open.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.480]   So what do you think we should do, Leo?
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.720]   I don't know.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.000]   Oh.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.880]   I would bury gold in the backyard.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.360]   I don't know.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.440]   I don't know.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:27.200]   What is the equivalent of a bomb shelter in a cyber world?
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.120]   Whatever that is.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.960]   I'd have-- I would say get a garden and some solar panels.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.160]   The less dependent you are upon the national infrastructure,
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.400]   the safer you'll be should that infrastructure, which to me,
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.760]   looks like it's getting more and more vulnerable,
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.720]   should it collapse.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.360]   I've been listening to No Agenda too much.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.760]   I'm just going to stop right now.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.280]   Wow.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.000]   Wow.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.600]   I think Gina's going to put her snugly up over her head high.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   Yeah, seriously.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.240]   I'm like, well, I think cryptidisc image.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.200]   Can you do not?
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.920]   But I mean, does anything I said not make sense?
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.120]   Can you give me a--
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.320]   I'd like to not believe any of that.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.880]   Everything that we do every single day,
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.440]   where there's some measure of trust.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.640]   You're putting yourself in your hands.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:12.120]   Of course.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.000]   You're just driving down the street.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.520]   You're kind of putting your trust in the car
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.200]   on the other side that is not going to run into you.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.120]   I mean, listen, I agree with you,
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.360]   but it's hard for me to think that my own personal backups
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.040]   are less secure than-- or more secure than Google servers.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.240]   I'm not worried about your backups.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.400]   I'm worried about the grid.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:29.680]   Right.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.440]   You're worried about the grid.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.920]   The water supply.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.440]   Right.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.440]   Well, that is the analogy.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.360]   The food supply.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.520]   What do we do?
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.440]   There's a reservoir serving Jersey City.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.080]   You could go and poison the reservoir.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:40.760]   It is possible.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.920]   We've talked about it through terrorism.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.360]   It's there.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.040]   It's not done.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:44.760]   Why isn't it done?
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.000]   Well, you have police.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.200]   Do they control somewhat, but they don't control absolutely?
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.200]   We play the odds.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.840]   Well, I guess I'm just going to get really good
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.960]   at wilderness camping or something.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.480]   I would.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480]   I don't know.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.480]   I don't know what to do.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.880]   You're just going to have to live with it, right?
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.320]   You're right.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.760]   I mean, this could have always happened.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   It just seems like we're moving in the direction
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.640]   where we're more and more reliant on our infrastructure.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.680]   And you know what?
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.880]   What stimulated this was this great lofty goal
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.640]   for a national broadband plan.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.600]   Which we do need.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.560]   Which we do need.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.360]   And yet, I certainly hope there is also equivalent energies,
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.120]   if not more energies, being put into protecting
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.360]   our infrastructure, our national cyber infrastructure.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.400]   Well, OK, so that's interesting.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.920]   Where does that innovation come from?
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.600]   I saw that--
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.400]   I think it was Peter's of Peter Principle said on Twitter
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.200]   this week that he talked to some bankers who
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.520]   said that all the innovation in Wall Street
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.520]   in the last 10 years went to going around regulation.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.000]   Right.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.760]   I stood up in South by Southwest at a great session
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.320]   about seed incubators, seed accelerators.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.240]   Because I want to do something like that for journalism
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:52.600]   at CUNY.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.040]   And I said, we have no innovation and entrepreneurship
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.880]   and journalism, so we've got to find a way to create it.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:03.920]   So where is the fountain of innovation in security?
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.160]   Good question.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.160]   That is a good question.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.800]   Is that something that government-- is that what
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.600]   government should be investing in?
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.160]   Could be in Fort Meade.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.160]   Maybe we don't know.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.440]   But maybe there's a wonderful team of very expert people.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:21.280]   I would hope that a lot of the best minds of the current
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:25.880]   generation would be going into this particular area
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.120]   and thinking about it.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.440]   Because I think it's something we have to resolve.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:37.000]   You see people like our dear friend Matt Cutz, who, in his way,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.720]   is devoting his career to playing whackable.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.640]   Right.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.640]   Good for him.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.640]   Good for him.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.800]   That's what he does.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.600]   When he talked on the show last time, which I think was a
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.560]   very important moment when he said that Google's looking for
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.720]   signals of quality and originality, there's a continuum
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.240]   of spam.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.800]   He's not just looking for the bad guys.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.960]   He's helping look for the good stuff.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.320]   I just look at things like that story out of Austin after we
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.680]   left some guy broke into-- and it was easy to do--
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.560]   trivial to do-- broke into the dealer's database.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.840]   The dealer had been putting--
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.120]   this Texas car dealer had been putting little black boxes
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.200]   in every single car they sold where they were carrying
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.520]   the paper so that if the people defaulted on the loan, they
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.880]   could turn the car off.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.440]   And this guy got fired.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.200]   He got laid off.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.800]   So he said, well, screw it.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.840]   He got into the database.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.480]   And he started disabling cars or making their horns go off
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.120]   without stop.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.840]   And over 100 cars before they finally--
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840]   Laugh, Gina.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.400]   They finally tracked him down.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.680]   But here's my problem.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.040]   First of all, the dealer was putting these little black boxes
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.920]   in every car they sold.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920]   Then they had--
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.920]   Yeah, that's the first thing.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.440]   Yeah, problem one.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.600]   I'm sure they didn't tell anybody.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.320]   Problem two, they didn't secure--
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:47.520]   obviously, the guy was fired and he got into the database.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.480]   They had a poorly secured database.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.840]   And software that allowed this guy to disable the cars
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.720]   or make their horns beep.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.320]   I think we've got like a million of those out there.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.120]   Who has the on-star database?
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.440]   Who's securing that?
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.760]   Whatever connected refrigerator can go off tomorrow.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.960]   I don't know.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.080]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.320]   That was a very big downer.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.200]   I apologize.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.760]   We're going to cheer you all up.
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:12.880]   It's time for our--
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.280]   Tear for you to chug a beer and go crowds for me.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.200]   No, but it's all seriousness, though.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.440]   I would love to have someone on the show, a guest on the show,
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.560]   one week who is doing this kind of work at that kind of level
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.120]   to talk about exactly what's going on.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.440]   Everybody I've ever talked to about cyber warfare
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.600]   is an incredible downer.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.800]   Oh, boy.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.960]   But I'll try to find somebody.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960]   Let's go on to the tip of the week.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.280]   Jonathan's the trend.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.200]   Bruce Schnire are two very good people.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.360]   We'll get Bruce on.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.640]   I'd love to get Bruce on.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.440]   That would be fantastic.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.480]   I can get Bruce on.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.040]   Bruce de presses me, too.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.200]   Yeah, he's probably one of the guys
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.160]   that really knows more than anybody.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.160]   Jonathan's a trend from Berkman who wrote the book,
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.840]   I think the future of the internet and how to stop it
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.560]   is brilliant on this topic and has concrete suggestions
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.280]   for what we should do.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:58.920]   Good.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.920]   I'd like to--
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.920]   And I would love for us to kind of compile,
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.200]   like the list of things one should consider
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.400]   before moving your stuff into the cloud.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.240]   What does it mean?
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.160]   When you move your stuff into the cloud, what does that mean?
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.360]   So things like people need a subpoena
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.800]   versus a search warrant to get to your data
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.480]   or what can go wrong, what you should know in terms of--
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.560]   I mean, because we do advocate for moving to the cloud.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.680]   But it would be good for us to have a list of things
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.880]   you should know.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880]   And Jeanna, before you do so.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.480]   I mean, we talked about before that I think you pointed out.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.400]   I was on the plane coming back from Austin
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.160]   with Charlie O'Donnell, who's an investor in back-upify.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.320]   And he was saying that the real strategy isn't back-uping
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.720]   backing up at all.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.840]   It is fluidity.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.480]   It is not being prison to anything.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.040]   Yes.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.400]   And then he goes back to our discussion earlier
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.560]   on the show about identity.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.640]   Well, and also getting away from a monoculture,
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.120]   which this is where I really fear
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.400]   is that we are moving to our monoculture, where everything
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.120]   is stored at Google.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.280]   Right.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.920]   And of course, everybody knows a monoculture is a bad idea.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.520]   All your eggs are in one basket is a bad idea.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.360]   Whether that's your data or your identity
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.360]   or your tracks of what you've done,
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.800]   you want fluidity with it.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.360]   And having it on a five-inch disk at home
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.600]   is not necessarily the best part.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.100]   No.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.080]   That's a really interesting topic.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.480]   We're also going to talk in just a bit about the ramping up
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:28.320]   of local municipalities trying to get this gigabit Google.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.720]   Because the deadline for nominations is March 26.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.520]   It is less than a week away.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.880]   And so the campaign is on.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.760]   Whether it's Topeka, Troy, or My Little Town of Petaluma,
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.000]   everybody wants to get this gigabit.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.560]   And only five cities are going to get it.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.120]   We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.840]   But first, our tip, our tool, and our number of the week
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.120]   starting with Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:53.480]   Yes.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.880]   My tip this week is for Google Calendar users
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:59.600]   who often schedule meetings with other people who also
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.280]   have Google calendars.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.640]   In Google Calendar Labs--
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:07.120]   if you click on the little labs beaker at the top--
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.960]   there's a new labs feature called Smart Rescheduler.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.800]   And if you enable it on your calendar,
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.400]   if you have to reschedule an event,
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.680]   it will recommend the best times where all the people who
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.440]   are attending your event are free based on their calendar.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.120]   So it's an easy way to see who's free
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.680]   and what time would work best for all the attendees.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.920]   So really good for Google Calendar users who often
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.080]   schedule things with other calendar users.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:32.960]   I love, though.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.120]   OK, so I'm looking at this.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.400]   And I would love to know how it works, what it does.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.040]   I would love to know anything.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.280]   There's nothing.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:41.760]   There's nothing.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.720]   There's nothing I can click.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.320]   It just says, helps you reschedule an event
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.560]   by analyzing everybody's schedule,
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.480]   evaluating conflicts, obtaining conference rooms,
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.800]   and proposing the best meeting times.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.040]   It's like magic.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:50.600]   It's like magic.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.640]   That's all you have to know.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.280]   When you just click on that enable--
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.320]   OK, I've enabled it.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.560]   And then you ask, I'm going to scroll all the way down
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.080]   and click Save.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.400]   Oh, yeah, I have to turn it on.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.440]   I always forget to do that.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.480]   Now it's in here.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.120]   There it is, smart rescheduler.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.400]   And it's just over on the right-hand side.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.200]   Yep, and you just click on an event.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:08.400]   Yep.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.480]   To find something that the people have invited me to, right?
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.520]   Current Geek Weekly, find a new time.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.560]   Loading calendars.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.680]   Look at that.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:18.480]   Yeah, so it checks out--
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.200]   That's pretty slick.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:19.760]   --the calendar.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.240]   And it gives you a suggestion.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.240]   It's a couple of steps.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.080]   But kind of a new--
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:25.680]   I need you to learn--
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.480]   I love my life.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:31.120]   Now forget what I said about monoculture.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.880]   I send myself over to the Google.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.920]   I give you my--
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.280]   That's always the trade-off, right?
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.440]   The risk-- the convenience versus risk.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.920]   The convenience of auto-elitmatically checking
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.680]   your friend's schedules.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.680]   Does it-- it must go into my friend's schedules then?
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.480]   Well, they have to have shared their calendars with you.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.400]   OK.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.000]   Which you'll do in an enterprise account.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:52.400]   Sure.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:52.760]   Right.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.480]   In an enterprise situation, absolutely.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.760]   There's a lot of labs features there
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.640]   in the Google Calendar labs.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.200]   It's very cool.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:58.560]   I love the labs.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.960]   Similar to Gmail labs.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.480]   Right.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.600]   Gina, would you plug your wonderful, wonderful piece
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.240]   about all these great Google tricks?
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.680]   Oh, yes, please.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.760]   Oh, sure.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.800]   I wrote a-- the current issue of Maximum PC Magazine--
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.240]   I think it's the April issue--
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.960]   the cover story is Google--
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.080]   is the Power Users Guide to Google Apps.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.800]   And it's like eight pages, 48 tips.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.400]   I mean, I learned a lot of stuff researching this article
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.320]   that I didn't realize that certain Google Apps could do.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.040]   It covers all apps from Maps to Picasa to Picasa Web Albums
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.000]   to Gmail.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.240]   Anyway, it is now online.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.640]   So you don't have to buy the magazine,
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.240]   but you should buy the magazine.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.480]   Just in case you don't want to kill trees,
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.160]   it's online now.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:38.240]   And we bookmarked it in the front feed.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:38.740]   OK.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.680]   It's at maxmanpc.com.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.680]   This is a great magazine.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.360]   You should get this magazine.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.520]   Yeah, it is a pretty great magazine.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.040]   And the layout's really cool.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.600]   And I got pictures of my grandpa-in-law
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.960]   and screenshots of Picasa.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.460]   Oh.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.120]   Police drag.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:53.620]   Yeah.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.200]   It was right around the time that he passed.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.360]   I was happy that Ettorz didn't cut those.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:15:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.200]   So it was a lot of fun.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.120]   It was a lot of fun to write that article.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.120]   And I got my little wave plug in there.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.960]   And it's-- yeah, calendar.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.360]   It's funny when I click the link, it linked it to dig.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.560]   OK, here we go.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.000]   The Power Users Guide to Google Apps.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   There you go.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:16.500]   Wonderful.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.840]   And there's lots of tips in there.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.920]   And I'll mention the few that kind of surprise me
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.200]   in upcoming episodes as my tip.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.620]   I've got a font of tips now.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:26.220]   I'm never going to be without a tip.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.740]   This is going to last me for like six months.
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.540]   Wow.
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:33.580]   All right, Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.580]   One guy suggested that my number of the week
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.260]   should be the number of times that you've
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.900]   stolen my number of the week.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.500]   That number growing all the time.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.940]   That did have three choices this week, one of which
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.540]   was the data about the YouTube deal.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.260]   But I have another one.
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.020]   Danny Sullivan has a--
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.140]   You're kidding.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.660]   So I chose your number again.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:52.180]   I think--
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.020]   I put three up there.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:53.680]   It's fine.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.200]   You're learning.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.760]   Danny Sullivan has a very good stat
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.960]   rant up at Search Engine Land, which he answers this hit-wise
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.600]   story that came out last week that I've talked about that
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.720]   said that Facebook was becoming bigger than Google and Twitter
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.760]   and sending to publishers.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.840]   And Danny digs in quite well.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.120]   The number was 3.64% of--
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.600]   that Facebook is 3.64% of the source to news and media sites.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.520]   Google News 1.27% and Twitter 0.14%.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.480]   A couple of problems with this.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.800]   Number one is Twitter, you cannot count as Twitter.com.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.080]   Most of Twitter, of course, is over other apps and so on.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.040]   And it makes an impossible to count the power of Twitter.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:40.480]   I look at Bitly as a proxy, but it's only a partial proxy.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:42.280]   I'm sure I follow more links from Twitter
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.320]   than any other source.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:44.600]   Absolutely.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.280]   But then Danny dug in further.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.640]   And the numbers came out this way
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:53.880]   that Google Sites as a whole caused 20% of the links
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.200]   clicks to news publisher sites.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.240]   Take that, Mr. Murdoch.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.800]   Yahoo, 18%, MSN, 8%, and Facebook 3.64%.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.360]   So Facebook is nothing to sneeze at,
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.120]   but Google hadn't caught a cold yet.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.720]   Facebook, for the first time this week,
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.480]   had more visitors than Google, right?
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.060]   Wasn't that-- in the US, wasn't that an interesting
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:16.720]   statistic, too?
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.640]   That was a new stack, yeah.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.160]   Kind of weird.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.240]   But again, Google isn't really a site to visit.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.440]   They don't visit Google.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.400]   No.
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.480]   No.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:27.040]   But still, more traffic to the Facebook page
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.960]   than the Google page is still a victim.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:30.960]   That's weird.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.480]   That's weird.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.720]   That doesn't sound possible.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.720]   It seems weird.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.640]   It's wrong.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.240]   It's wrong.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:41.720]   So my tool is a tool for your Android folks.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.000]   I'm not giving up on buzz.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.600]   I'm not.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.240]   I just won't.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.640]   Google released-- oh, let's not show somebody's phone number here.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.040]   Let me go back to the front page.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.360]   I do that all the time.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.280]   Google released a new widget.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.360]   Oh, I love this widget.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.040]   You can download.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.520]   If you do need to use, I think, Android 1.6 or later.
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.440]   But if you go to the Android Marketplace
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.000]   and you search for Google Buzz, you
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   will find the new Buzz widget.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.880]   I commented on Buzz that it would be really nice if Google's
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.280]   API was advanced enough that there were some really good third-party
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.120]   developers writing Buzz applications.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.840]   But they don't yet really give you the tools
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.480]   you need to write Buzz applications.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.560]   So we're going to have to let Google do the widgets
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.360]   for the time being.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.400]   But this is really nice.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.720]   I put it right on my front page because, again, I'm trying
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.240]   to get people to use Google Buzz.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.200]   It automatically does the location.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.520]   I can add a picture.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.120]   I can add multiple pictures to it.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.440]   And then I can tweet out with it.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.800]   You can tweet out to--
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:38.480]   Did I say tweet?
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.120]   Oh, you said tweet.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:40.880]   Some of it.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.760]   Bitch.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.920]   I can buzz out with it.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.160]   Damn.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.480]   Damn.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.600]   So there you go.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.400]   There's the problem in a nutshell.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.320]   Yeah, it is.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.880]   I used it a few times yesterday.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.800]   You also have the option to do public and private.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.120]   That basically does everything you can do on the web interface.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.160]   And what's nice is that a mobile interface does not give you
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.120]   all of these capabilities.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.880]   So you really do need a standalone application
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.960]   or a widget of some kind to make this work.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.640]   If you click the Buzz icon on the widget,
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.760]   it'll take you to a browser with Buzz.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:18.640]   And this little multi-picture will allow you to pick a photo or two
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.000]   from your gallery.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.480]   So a really nice way to buzz.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.080]   And if more people would please use Buzz,
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.520]   I would be very gratified.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.440]   Great.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.360]   But nobody's using it.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.800]   So it's over for Buzz.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:31.360]   A lot of good conversations have on Buzz.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:34.680]   I love the-- see, to me, threaded conversations are so great.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.400]   I don't understand.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:40.000]   I had the same thing happen to me when I left Twitter for Jiku.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.720]   And nobody followed me.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.800]   Then I left Twitter for Park.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.680]   Nobody followed me.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.280]   I left Twitter for Friend Feed.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.120]   And nobody followed me.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.160]   Now I've left Twitter for Buzz.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.000]   And nobody's following me.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.120]   Next thing, yes, you're going to leave everybody for your bunker.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.120]   Come, go into the bunker.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.120]   You're going to follow the--
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.760]   Screw y'all.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:01.280]   So I brought my member of the city council, Petaluma City
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.480]   Council in.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.760]   Her name is Tiffany Renee.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.680]   She's a wonderful person.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.760]   Hi, Tiffany.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.280]   Hello, Liam.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.680]   Thank you for coming in.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.000]   Tiffany, before she became a member of the city council,
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.200]   actually still probably is since they pay you $5 a meeting,
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.040]   was a web designer.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:17.800]   I'm still a web designer.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.520]   Still have to do that, don't you?
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.640]   The hacking is actually crippling my ability
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.440]   to be a web designer.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.480]   Is it really?
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.520]   Last year was really tough.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.120]   No kidding.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.160]   No kidding.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.720]   Oh, so I guess I wasn't wrong.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.360]   So one of the things Petaluma has been doing,
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:35.840]   like a lot of other communities, is lobbying hard to get
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.280]   Google to put that gigabit internet service in here.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.520]   So what is it town?
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.320]   What do you do?
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.880]   How do you get people to--
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:46.760]   what do you need to do, I guess?
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.080]   It actually started as a really grassroots process.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.040]   We had a couple of people bring it up to us,
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.880]   and I'd heard about it and mentioned it to a few people.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.880]   And it just has gotten a lot of traction.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.840]   We have a new member of the technology and telecommunications
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.760]   committee that has kind of really led that chart.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:03.960]   That's nice.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.800]   And is the community understand?
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.600]   I think that there are members of the community
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.600]   who really get it.
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:14.640]   And others that may not understand it
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.600]   or just haven't been connected yet to know what it means to us.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.880]   One of the things you've done, and I
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.720]   think many municipalities who've done this,
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:23.240]   is create a Facebook page.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.720]   We were late in the game on that.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.560]   We actually just started that on Monday,
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.560]   and it actually took off like a rocket once we got it up.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.240]   Yeah, you got a lot.
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.520]   We're a little behind on that compared to the other cities,
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.440]   but it's growing by the minute.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.680]   It's kind of like campaigning for the Olympics.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.040]   It's kind of a long shot.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.080]   It is. I think you need some gimmicks.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:42.560]   Like what?
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.360]   I just asked the chat room.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.080]   Here's my first bid.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:46.520]   OK.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.800]   I think you need to get every school child in Petaluma
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.400]   in a school bus and drive down to the campus.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.920]   There you go, and beg, and please--
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.000]   And sing the Google song or something.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.400]   Is there a Google song?
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.320]   Big one up.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.360]   Make up a Google song and sing it.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.960]   I love you, Google.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.560]   Oh, yes we do.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.480]   Yeah, who can refuse singing school children?
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.240]   Exactly.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.240]   Can we do that, Tiffany?
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:11.520]   Nearby enough, you can beat Topeka.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.080]   Is Topeka the front runner?
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.600]   You should be ashamed of yourself.
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.160]   I hope Topeka is not the front runner.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.480]   Twig and one of the other wonderful things there.
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.000]   You're in Cyberville.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.320]   You must win.
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.440]   You must gather the twang together.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.040]   We're the head to Sonoma Wine Country,
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.840]   and we're within the Bay Area.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.360]   Google could drive up here.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.560]   They wouldn't have to fly.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:30.560]   That's true.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.640]   They could drive up.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.720]   I think there's a lot of reasons why it would be great for Google
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.720]   to choose us.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:42.600]   And it would be like a vacation for the folks from Google
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.640]   to do it here as well.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.040]   San Jose Mercury News writes, "Gaga for Google.
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.840]   Communities compete for high speed internet.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.320]   They're swimming Google teenies in Sarasota, Florida,
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.120]   vowing to Googleize the names of their firstborn children
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:55.440]   in Duluth.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.280]   Topeka--
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280]   See, I think you've got to do something.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.600]   I think you've got to bribe the Googlers.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.240]   What products is Petaluma known for besides slugs?
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.240]   We're known for slugs?
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.200]   I went to-- I judged a slug bake off years ago.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:09.700]   What?
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:10.200]   Where's this guy?
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.920]   I thought it was there.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.000]   Are you thinking Santa Cruz?
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.240]   I think you're thinking Santa Cruz.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:14.960]   Sorry about that.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.280]   I didn't mean to--
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.360]   Good Lord.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.040]   What is Petaluma known for?
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.880]   We're known for butter and eggs and wrestling.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:23.760]   And twit.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:24.260]   And twit.
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:25.280]   And absolutely twit.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.280]   And twit.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.440]   I think this is the pitch, right, Tiffany?
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.280]   School children cook the largest omelette.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.200]   Oh, there you go.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.160]   At Google and then Leo wrestles in it.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.920]   Topeka has renamed itself Google, Kansas.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:44.800]   Troy is bringing out 100 Uncle Sam's help the FedEx.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:45.320]   Oh, no.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.440]   We're much, much more than this.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.280]   The city of Palo Alto, which is really
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.840]   is just down the road from Google, says,
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.240]   the whole country is going googoo over Google.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.880]   If I were Google, I'd look very hard at Palo Alto.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.880]   We've got a lot of Facebook employees living here.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.320]   That's not good.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.080]   That's not what Google wants to do is empower Facebook employees.
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:08.760]   One of the things I think that the other cities are missing
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.360]   that we do have is Leo and twit.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.600]   And no Facebook employees live here.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.480]   Or Yahoo employees, right, Tiffany?
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.160]   I don't think so.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.200]   No.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.280]   And if they do, we'll ship them out.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.040]   We'll banish them.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.600]   If there are any Facebook employees who live in Petaluma,
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.120]   you're gone.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:28.800]   How about that?
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.400]   That's what Google's looking for.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.480]   You said that, not me.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.400]   Oh, I know.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.320]   How about Apple employees?
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.200]   We'll tar and feather them.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.360]   In butter and eggs.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.200]   In butter and eggs.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.720]   We'll make an omelet out of them.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.840]   It'll be an apple omelet.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.160]   It is interesting how much competition.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.440]   What does it mean, do you think economically for a community
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.320]   if they get this fiber for communities?
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.280]   I think it's huge.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:57.600]   The ability for our schools to get the bandwidth is key,
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.960]   I think, to their success.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.320]   Make a big difference in schools, yeah.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.640]   It would make a huge difference for them.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:06.960]   I think for Petaluma, we have a large number of creatives
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.760]   that live here, people that work from home, people
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.520]   that commute to the Bay Area.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.720]   And I think that's one of the target demographics
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.440]   that Google is looking for, are people
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.840]   that are willing to step up and demand that kind of bandwidth
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.600]   use it.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.240]   But in Highlands, Ranch, Colorado,
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.720]   boosters were planning to get residents
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:25.280]   to form a human We Love Google sign at the local football
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:25.680]   stadium.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.120]   You can talk and talk, Tiffany.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.840]   But where's our We Love Google sign?
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.280]   Will they buy it if they--
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.280]   Ah.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.920]   And I think that women's will buy it if they lay it.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.720]   If you lay it, we will come.
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.480]   No, that's bad.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.960]   That's not going to work.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.520]   That's not going to work.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.560]   A blogger in upstate New York lobbying for Buffalo
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:47.680]   says, at least take Buffalo out of the dark ages
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.760]   and bring our internet power up to the rest of the world.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.920]   Boca Raton says, hey, we're the birthplace
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.440]   of the IBM Personal Computer.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.920]   Holland, Michigan, the public works folks
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.400]   created a superhero pushing--
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.960]   It's just like the Olympics.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.960]   You've got to step up here and make some kind of vow.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.080]   What can I do, Jeff?
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:10.800]   What could I vow?
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.400]   I'll shave your head.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.000]   There's an old--
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.040]   I'll shave my head if Google--
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.920]   walk, geez, I'll walk down--
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:16.880]   I'll tell you what.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.040]   I'll dress up in a giant chicken outfit.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.360]   And what should I do, Tiffany?
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:24.040]   Walk down the street, the main street of a pet alumina.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:25.240]   Maybe go to Google.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.160]   Oh, you got to go to Google.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160]   Go to Google.
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.640]   What would Google-- what would-- OK.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:32.000]   So help me--
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.640]   Tattoo the Google logo to yourself?
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.120]   I will tattoo Google on my forehead
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:39.800]   so that every Twit broadcast for the rest of eternity--
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.560]   now maybe that's going too far.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:42.360]   That's a little too far.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.160]   I mean, I think shaving the G in the back your head
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.240]   could be pretty cool.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.360]   OK, OK, I'll shave a G in I'll dye it, multicolors.
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:49.880]   Yeah, you need the multicolors.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.360]   You kind of need the Google balls, the multicolor balls.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.160]   Deal.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.840]   The chicken outfit is--
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.000]   so is that about the eggs?
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   What's the chicken outfit?
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.680]   Yeah, but yeah, this used to be a big butter and eggs
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:00.200]   capital.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.760]   It's a woody Allen joke in there somewhere.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.680]   There really is.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.200]   We don't--
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:03.680]   So basically--
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.680]   We need the eggs.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.680]   We did that one before.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:10.360]   You could vow to beach your crowd surfing record
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.840]   at the Google plex.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.600]   I will crowd surf my--
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:14.520]   I know.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.360]   I will crowd surf my way from Petaluma to Mountain View.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:20.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.040]   So this is just a big ad campaign for Google, right?
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.040]   This is what this means.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.040]   Yeah, look who's getting the benefit.
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.320]   You know, they're not doing good for a community.
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.960]   They're actually just getting communities
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.200]   to do free advertising for them.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.400]   In Sarasota, Florida, citizens of Recryssen
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.720]   to Waterbound Park as Google Island,
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.120]   a local restaurateur is serving Google teenies.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.120]   You got to move way past this.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.960]   I think you got to go to the Google plex.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.640]   That's your advantage for everybody else.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:49.560]   And you speak Google.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:55.040]   Yeah, what if I just had a lone person with my staff,
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:59.520]   my backpack, and a sign, just-- what should the sign say?
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.240]   Well, I've got it.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.720]   You'll camp out on the lawn of the Google plex
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.320]   and broadcast from there until they give you--
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.280]   Oh, that's not a bad idea.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.160]   Should I do that, Tiffany?
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:08.720]   What do you think?
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.160]   I don't know.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.600]   I think the gimmicks are great, but I don't think
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.720]   that they're really reality.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.920]   And I think Petaluma's got the reality.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:15.920]   We should push.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.520]   We have a telecom committee.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.000]   We have a technology and telecom committee.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:19.500]   We did.
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.760]   I used to serve on it.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:24.080]   We're really committed to the innovations.
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.280]   And I don't necessarily see that with some of the other cities
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.200]   that are doing the gimmicks.
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.280]   So I think they're fun, and they're great to get--
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:33.160]   But it doesn't tell Google what it needs to know.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.160]   Exactly.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.360]   And I do think that our application will be very strong.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.400]   Our city's very committed to the process.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.360]   They've been spending quite a bit of time at City Hall
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.360]   working on it.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.040]   And in our technology and telecommunications committee
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.840]   has really reached out to the community,
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.720]   and the community has responded in big ways.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:53.320]   So what Petaluma and all these communities are asking people
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:30:03.320]   to do is go to a ridiculous URL, which is google.com/appserve/fiber
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:06.920]   rfi-- oh, that's easy to remember.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.040]   We should make a bit lately.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.160]   Yeah, we did it shortly.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.440]   We did it shortly, and that.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.720]   Should I-- wait a minute.
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.040]   Let me fix that.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.360]   I can do that.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.400]   That much I can do.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:21.480]   Let me give it a bitly link for this one and go on here.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.840]   Make it slash Petaluma though.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, because we don't want anybody else to use it.
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.720]   We should use the Google Shortener.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:30.000]   Oh, should we use a Google-- how do you get to the Google?
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.720]   Is GOO.GL?
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.600]   Is that it?
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:36.160]   Yeah, I think I have the bookmarklet here somewhere.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.680]   Google URL Shortener.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.520]   OK.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.040]   Tiffany, this is what happens on the show.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:44.400]   Yeah, this is the rat hole the show goes down.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.360]   You should also go to facebook.com/google.com/google.com.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.040]   Petaluma, that's where we are right now.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.200]   That's easy.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.680]   But I want the world to vote for us.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.800]   All right, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.680]   Go to google.com/google.com/google.com.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.800]   You don't even have to be a Facebook user.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.120]   And if it's some other town, go ahead.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.360]   You can go there and use the link that'll
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.000]   take you to that silly Google fiber for communities.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.360]   Their goal is to install this, I think,
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.800]   into five different towns ranging in size from $50,000 to $500,000.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.320]   So we just make the cut, we're a little over 50.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.480]   We do, and actually, there's other communities,
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.680]   Santa Rosa, which is just north of here,
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.800]   and actually our smart train system,
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:28.040]   the railway that comes through Sonoma County,
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.600]   they're also interested in applying as well.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:34.720]   And Google may look at all three of our applications
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.240]   and see those as a really powerful mix.
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:37.880]   Together.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.160]   That's a good idea.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.840]   And make a concerted effort for all of Sonoma County,
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.040]   which is mostly the hub through the 101,
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:51.680]   where the smart train runs from Petaluma to Santa Rosa.
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.640]   So there's some exciting propositions,
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:57.640]   I think, out there for Google in terms of what we are proposing
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:00.400]   as a city, and then also the other communities in the county.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.360]   You know, the truth is this Facebook page is pretty cute.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.080]   If you want to just kind of know what Petaluma's all about,
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.800]   there's a lot of great little posts on here.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.760]   And there is a lot of interest for this, actually.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:12.280]   We've gotten some kids, some of our youth
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:14.480]   that are up there posting, what kinds of things
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:15.440]   that they would do with it.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:16.880]   And I think that's important.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.720]   That's part of the information that Google's looking for
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.880]   is what people will do with it, what the interests are.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:29.080]   And, you know, heaven forbid we don't get the award,
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:29.760]   the application.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:30.760]   Then I'm moving to it.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.760]   We know what our community is looking for
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:33.400]   so that we can--
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.400]   That's true too.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:34.960]   --feel it our infrastructure needs.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.040]   That's a good point.
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:36.760]   Very good point.
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.080]   I like that.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.160]   Thank you, Tiffany, for pulling it.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.600]   You're going to like Topeka.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.000]   I'm not moving to Topeka.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.240]   I have a lot of bunkers there.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.360]   I--
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.600]   Yeah, after saying, oh, yeah, we're all
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.960]   too reliant on the monoculture and infrastructure,
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:51.720]   I'm saying.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.920]   But I'd be glad to give up all of my different connections
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.480]   for one Google connection.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.840]   Yeah, just think of that.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:00.160]   Google, you could say that the whole Twitch network runs
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.200]   on Google fiber.
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.600]   How about that?
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:04.000]   How about that?
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.280]   I'd be glad to do that.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:10.440]   Anyway, I did make a bit.ly, bit.ly/googlepetaluma.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:11.920]   You could also go there.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.600]   And you have till March 26 to vote for your community,
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.240]   whatever community it is.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.440]   And we'll be very interested.
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:18.920]   I think the next time we're on the show,
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:20.480]   we'll probably be talking about, I don't know how they're
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:20.960]   going to do this.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:25.400]   And announce nominees and then make you dance.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.320]   Dance Petaluma Dance!
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.320]   If you want Google, make a Yo Shave is here.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.600]   Yes.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.040]   I will.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.720]   I'll shave my head with a G.
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.560]   And I'll tie it in color.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:39.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.560]   Remember your iPhone?
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.400]   I will.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.400]   Oh.
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.640]   Gladly, I will take my iPhone and smash it with a sledgehammer.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:46.640]   Wow.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:51.560]   And vow only to use the Nexus 1 forever.
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.320]   Or until the iPhone 4 comes out.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:55.560]   I think you've got to make a YouTube video with a hammer
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:56.880]   poised over it.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.280]   Oh, that's good.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.560]   That's good.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.560]   Or I can have it twice over the Nexus 1.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.200]   That's a great idea.
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.080]   That's a great idea.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:05.560]   See?
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:05.920]   Look creatively.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.440]   They would do this fiber.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.600]   Tiffany, thank you for coming in.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.600]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.520]   Tiffany Renee is a member of the City Council of Petaluma
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.200]   and a good friend.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.360]   And it's so nice to see you.
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.240]   And enjoy spring.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:19.320]   Happy spring everyone.
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:22.080]   And whatever community you're in,
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.120]   I think getting Google fiber would be a big deal.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.960]   But where would you get more publicity Google than right
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.600]   here?
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.040]   Really.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.920]   That's not that you're selling your solar in a video,
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.800]   but I'd sell myself for that.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.080]   Give me a bit of fiber.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.680]   And I'll sell my soul.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:41.600]   What a hand will do for bandwidth.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.600]   Thank God.
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:46.160]   Gina Tripani is the author of the complete guide
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:48.800]   to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:52.480]   And now in paper form, amazing.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.240]   Her blog, of course, is smarterware.org.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.600]   You can catch your writing in Maximum PC Magazine this month
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.440]   in many other great places.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.800]   And it's always great to see you, Gina.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:01.640]   Thank you.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.280]   Thanks for having me.
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:02.800]   Fun show today.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:03.760]   It's a part of the show.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.640]   Thank you for-- I see you've divested yourself
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:07.120]   with the blanket.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:07.680]   I did.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.280]   It's a little warm here in San Diego today.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:11.440]   But this blanket-- I'm wrapped up in this blanket
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.320]   pretty much nightly, although it's pretty fuzzy.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.280]   I'm still trying to--
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.920]   Are the red fuzzballs still plaguing you?
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:20.040]   The red fuzzballs are creating some tension in my house.
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.480]   I don't know if they're a problem here for fuzzballs.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.080]   So I'm going to wash it with a towel.
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:26.360]   That's the next tactic.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.000]   So maybe the little physics little friction.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.480]   Is that how you get rid of fuzzballs?
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.720]   I have no Martha Stewart, but I'm going to try that.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.240]   I'll report back next week to tell you how that went.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:40.240]   Jeff Jarvis is the man in charge at buzzmachine.com.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.720]   I'm going to get your picture up here.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:42.720]   Jeff, I have to pick you up.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:43.800]   Hey, you're confusing us again.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.240]   I'm confusing you again.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.920]   If you could do it, I could do it.
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.200]   What would Google do?
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.280]   That's the name of the book.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.560]   And everybody should go out and buy it quickly as possible.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:54.880]   Thank you, Jeff, for being here.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.280]   Thank you.
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.160]   Really appreciate it.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:56.520]   And of course--
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.800]   Thank you again for a great fun time in Austin, Leo.
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.120]   We had so much fun in Austin.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.400]   What a great time that was.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.320]   Even if we were--
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.320]   It was a great time to give us together.
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:05.680]   We were snugly free.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.040]   And I am wearing my-- there we go.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.280]   We're putting on our Google Snuggles.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.280]   Hey, guys.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:09.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:15.640]   We're braving the red fuzzball menace to beg Google, please.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.160]   Bring fiber to Petaloma.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.200]   I beg of you.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.360]   What a nice little town.
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:21.440]   There's a cute little town.
