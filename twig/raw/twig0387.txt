[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google! Stacey Egan-Botham is here. Jeff has the week off.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   No politics, I'm sorry. We're in Nukem the Maker guy is here also. We're gonna talk about CES.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Stacey found so many interesting weird, cool, and useless gadgets in CES. We've got a long list.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   What's happening to Hangouts? Where is Google Voice going? And Waymo!
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   It's made it Waymo less expensive to buy Lidar.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Yeah, that doesn't really work, does it?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   This week in Google's Next.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   From the Google verse, I have to give you disclaimer every single week, because I still get emails.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   You know, you spent the whole first segment of this week at Google on Facebook.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Yeah. It's not just Google, despite the name. It's the internet, what's going on in the world with Jeff Jarvis here.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's often about journalism, because, hey, that's changing too.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It's really the show, if anything, is about how the world is changing thanks to technology.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Jeff is not here. He's traveling. So we've got Aaron Newcomb filling in. It's great to see you, Aaron.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Hey, good to see you, Leo.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Regular appearance on this network on Floss Weekly on the new screensavers all about Android.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   He's a maker, runs the Benetia Maker Space.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Good friend of the network is great to see you. I don't know. Have you met Stacey Higginbotham?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Oh, yeah. Yeah, we've been on before, I think, a couple of times, maybe.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Yeah. Stacey's here.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I get excited when Aaron's on.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah. Stacey's here from the IoT podcast, IoTpodcast.com.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And Stacey on IoT, she's an IoT guru, a journalist going way back and just back from CES.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   How was it?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It was awesome. And I'm going to apologize to everybody because I have a cold.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So I might be less coherent than usual, but still excited.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Just as enthusiastic. I'm happy to see.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   A lot of people came back. We were just talking to Paul Theron on Windows Weekly.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And he's so grumpy about CES. And everybody gets sick.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You get you did. I noticed you have a cold.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So I was so okay.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I don't get grumpy about a lot of things because I'm pretty darn cheerful.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   This was not a CES where you saw lots of new things.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I didn't walk through going, "Holy cow, my world is rock. This is amazing."
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But I did see a maturation in IoT.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I saw a lot of really interesting hardware start-ups that are actually pulling together
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   some really important pieces.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And I also saw Qualcomm has this amazing glance technology that is doing computer vision.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Like that, itty-bitty on a chip.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And it consumes sub two milliwatts of power, which means you can have computer vision on a chip.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You can have computer vision on a sensor.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's pretty game changing. It's not real yet, though.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That was kind of part of the CES vaporware, except Qualcomm usually does try to bring these things out.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   They're giving it to their partners to experiment with it.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And as a note for people who care about computer vision, this is only going to do limited models.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So it's only going to be able to tell the difference between a few things.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So it's not like Facebook style. It will recognize your individual face, but it would recognize people versus trees and dogs.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So...
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   The Qualcomm story is actually kind of interesting.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   They've gone through several cycles.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   In fact, they were a real hot stock for a while because they made what the CDMA chips that all the phone companies were using.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Well, Verizon.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Well, Verizon. One of the other...
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   ...inspirate.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   But it seems as if, you know, through acquisitions and through kind of a little bit of pivoting, they've now become like a chip maker to rival Intel.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So that's been going on, I think, as the mobile evolution revolution happened.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   People were like, "Oh, look, Qualcomm is the Intel of the mobile phone."
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And they were. And part of it was because they had their applications processors, the brains, melted to the radio.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   So it was cheaper. So you had this massive Qualcomm silicon package and you were like, "Yeah, yeah."
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But then they were originally a radio company.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And they were.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And then they just adapted ARM architecture to make them a multi-purpose chip, a system on a chip.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And that's what really propelled them.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   They saw that we were going to do that we could shove more computing into a small phone.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And they were like, "Hey, how can we do this with maximum efficiencies and lowest costs for smartphone people?"
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   They also did a smart thing.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   When it wasn't clear who was going to be the next generation, they chose LTE over YMAX.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And that turned out to be a very good choice. And they've become the LTE radio provider.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   They actually bought a YMAX company, Flareon, and they got the patents associated with YMAX,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   but they were like, "That's probably not going to be it." And then all in on LTE.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So they actually did a little hedge.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   What I didn't know is that they own Atheros, which is probably the number one Wi-Fi chip maker as well.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Three years ago, that was like an IoT buy.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And then they also, so you see them, like I always follow Qualcomm because they usually,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   right before something gets super hot, is when they make their investments.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So they actually bought AMD's graphics division back in the day before everyone was like,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   "Hey, I want to watch videos on my phone."
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   They did Atheros. They just did. What did they just do? They did some drone deals.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And now they're going to be bought by NXP.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   No, they're buying NXP. Who's buying whom?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   They own some merger.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's a merger.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Qualcomm and NXP merger, how that's interesting.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   They own Surf, which is the big GPS chip company.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   They really, if you look at what they own and their portfolio and what they're doing,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   and now with this 835 chip, which they also talked about at CES,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   which is not merely a server chip, but like a super chip,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   the first 10 nanometer FinFET technology,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   they're actually at the point where they're eclipsing Intel.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   No?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Okay, so there are more companies because they've built everything on the ARM architecture,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   which isn't a bad plan.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   There's a lot of other ARM manufacturers, though.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Exactly. There's a whole other ecosystem at play here.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So Intel was the only x86, so there was no competition.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   But even Intel wants to make ARM now.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I know, they do.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   But like, Cavium has a server chip for a server,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   a server chip for servers.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   I'm an ARM-based server chip,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Applied Micro has one.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Okay. So they're not the only player in the ARM space.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   But they're definitely the largest and most credible.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   They have a deal in China to make servers.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And they're making, and again, they're making systems on a chip,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   which is a more, you know, so Apple makes ARM processors.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   They don't make them, but they create their own ARM-based processors for their iPhone and iPod.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Samsung is a big ARM manufacturer.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The X-NOS chip is based on ARM.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Yep.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   But ARM is hot.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I mean, Microsoft announced Windows on ARM a couple of weeks ago.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   That was big.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   A lot of people in Apple land are convinced that Apple eventually will move off x86,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   the Intel architecture, and move everything to ARM.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Of course, not just the iOS stuff, but the Mac OS stuff as well.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Aaron, you must be following all this, too,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   because as a maker, you're playing with chips all the time.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Right. And a lot of the boards that I use use all winter.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   They're another player in the ARM space.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And you can develop an ARM sock fairly easily.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   The standards are out there.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And ARM is getting faster and faster all the time.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   So, you know, there's reports out about, you know, all the new phones.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   It's like, wow, when is ARM going to, you know, move past Intel in terms of performance?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It's not quite desktop.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   It goes.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Right.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   It's not desktop class, but there's a lot of processing power there.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And there's things that you can do with it.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And all of the libraries have been written compiled on ARM now.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   So, when you're using an ARM system, it feels just like you were using, you know,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   any other system, a BSD or Linux or, for that matter, a Windows.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So, yeah, all of the ARM is huge in the maker community.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And because the systems don't need to be as big, they're smaller, they're for hobbyists,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   they're easier and cheaper to produce.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   For all of those reasons, ARM is just really becoming, and it's different, you know?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   It's different.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   It's a different sort of architecture.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So, it doesn't necessarily have to compete with Intel.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Right.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Because--
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Low power.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So, both in terms of power usage and in terms of abilities, but that's changing a little
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   bit as it gets faster and faster and smarter and smarter.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.980]   And ultimately, IoT is driving us towards this distributed computing model where no
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.980]   one computer needs to be that fast, right?
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.980]   Right.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.980]   Well, I was going to say, ARM doesn't think about--I mean, okay, they think about processing.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.980]   But you see this even with Intel when they're talking about things, processing power is not
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.980]   the game it used to be.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:48.980]   Now you're looking at, you know, performance per watt, you're looking at battery life if
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.980]   you're not talking about servers.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:56.980]   So, I think, again, now, if you're actually thinking about investment or, like, the future,
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.980]   an important thing to think about is a lot of ARM 1.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.980]   ARM is licensing its technology.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.980]   So, it's not a one-to-one to Intel.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.980]   Yeah, ARM doesn't make chips.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.980]   ARM is an architecture, not a manufacturer.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.980]   They're fabulous.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.980]   They're fabulous.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.980]   Fabulous.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.980]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:20.980]   But, too, a lot of these embedded chips, they sell for, like, five bucks or less.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.980]   Right.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.980]   And Intel chips are, like, what, 130, 200?
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.980]   They come in an armored truck with the seat of it coming into it.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   Intel comes from that mindset where you have one big thing, one big expensive computer.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.980]   ARM comes from the idea of having lots of mini-mites everywhere, right?
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.580]   So, we used to go to CES every year.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:50.980]   We'd always be in the South Hall by the home automation alliance, the Zigbee, the Z-Wave,
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.980]   all of these people.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.980]   I visited those boots.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.980]   Oh, remember the Zigbee Pavilion?
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:02.980]   And it was always, every year I'd go, and it was like the land that time forgot.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.980]   There was just very little progress made over a period of 10, 15 years.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:13.980]   Are we finally making that some headway here with home automation?
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.980]   Things look cleaner and prettier.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:27.380]   So, there, I saw over a dozen companies with full on smart home automation suites for sale.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.780]   And they range from service providers, like Deutsche Telekom has one.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.780]   I can't think of it.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.980]   It starts with a Q-Coivio, Q-Coivio.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.580]   Anyway, Comcast actually was there for the first time showing off Xfinity Home, so this
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.140]   was their first booth.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:49.340]   And then you had a lot of very viable Chinese companies coming in, like Zmondo had a very
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.540]   pretty well-designed products that I'm actually going to get copies of.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.740]   I'm going to get versions of so I can review them because I was actually really impressed
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.020]   at what they were showing.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:09.500]   And so, that feels maybe not progressed, but it feels usable for normal people.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.120]   It doesn't feel like a bunch of people and programmers and CDI guys hanging around those
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.120]   booths.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.420]   They felt like real people could be there.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.820]   Where it always was hobbled was by the tower of Babel of all these different protocols,
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.620]   none of which talked to anything else.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.500]   And then we went through the hub era, which was smart.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.500]   We're still in the hub era.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.700]   We're still in the hub era where people like smart things and others would create a hub
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.180]   that spoke many languages and the idea was, well, we can control it all.
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:43.460]   But it's always been too complicated for consumers, too fragmented to invest.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.260]   I mean, you would be very reluctant to invest heavily.
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.780]   All that gets you had to.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:52.220]   If you went Crestron, well, you're all Crestron now, or you go Zigbee.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.140]   Well, you're all Zigbee now.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.340]   And so, Apple came along with HomeKit.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.540]   Google's got its home play, although I don't know what to call it.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.700]   Those are all too early.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.140]   It's too early.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.700]   I talked to people three to five years till standards don't matter, till the protocol
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.700]   wars don't matter.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.700]   And I was like, well, what do I do?
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.700]   Do I buy my light bulbs today?
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.700]   And they're like, sure you do.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.180]   They said three to five years ago, they said that.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.180]   No one is.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.940]   So what Zigbee got together with the thread group?
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.700]   These are two wireless protocols that run, both run on 802. Oh, I'm going to screw it
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.940]   up 15.4, I think.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.580]   The Zigbee radio basically thread runs on that too.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.580]   They created dot dot.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.940]   So now we've got to be thinking dot dot is the application layer that goes over it and
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.140]   talks to things.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.140]   It's called dot dot.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.940]   Yes, dot dot.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.940]   Just dot dot.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.660]   The goal is eventually it's like a doctor do little kind of animal.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.060]   I got a dot dot here.
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.620]   It goes two ways at once.
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:56.380]   So that's in that'll compete with Intel's backing something called Iotivity.
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.380]   Oh, God.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.140]   I know they're awesome.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.940]   All the good names are taken.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.940]   They are.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.940]   Iotivity.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.060]   So last year it was all joined in Iotivity.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.620]   And Iotivity eight all joined.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.820]   So now that's part of Iotivity.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:19.220]   So now your two standards wars are going to be Iotivity dot dot.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.100]   And I'm going to say we've from Google.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   Okay.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.100]   Yeah, hopefully.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.100]   Hopefully.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.500]   Why do you like we've Aaron?
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.980]   Why would you like we've to be a player?
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.300]   Because I guess I trust Google to manage it.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.300]   I don't think they have a huge stake in it.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.420]   Their stake is different than everybody else's.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.540]   They're not necessarily trying to sell devices.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.980]   Yeah, if anybody were going to unite, it would be Google because they don't they're not
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.700]   in a hardware business, particularly there in the right the communications business,
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.700]   I guess, right?
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.700]   Right.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:58.060]   And yeah, intelligence, business or data business, you know, and so so for that reason
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:04.620]   and also because, you know, in order to get these devices to work, you code that is fast,
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:10.300]   is simple and Google's really good at doing fast, simple code.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.180]   I mean, that's their bread.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.180]   They have to do that.
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.340]   That's how your searches on Google show up so quickly.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.580]   And that's how you can ask Google home to do something and it responds, you know, almost
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.580]   instantaneously.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.140]   It is kind of amazing.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.140]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.540]   And so if anybody can make that happen, I think, you know, I'd like Google to, you know, I
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.060]   wanted Google to win with things like Google+, and, you know, things like, there's a whole
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.140]   string of things I've wanted to do.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.140]   I think that's over.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.340]   Yeah, all of those things, right?
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.580]   I think that one's over.
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.420]   I hate to tell you, Aaron, bad news.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.860]   That's the downside, right?
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.980]   Is there's things like, you can go back and there's a whole history of Google buzz and
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.900]   all these things that were cool, but Google kind of fell down on it.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.260]   And so I'm hoping they don't this time, but if it becomes a standard and other people
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.140]   start using it, then that's what happened with Android, right?
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.940]   And say, what does Google need to do to make a threat and weave succeed?
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.140]   How big is weave?
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:05.620]   That was one of, I don't know how much memory you need to have, like, to run it because
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.860]   in IoT, you need something that runs on a super small footprint.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.580]   That's where Iotivity is weak right now.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:15.820]   Google's Brillo is too big, but I don't know where weave is.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.820]   And I know.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.820]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.820]   Brillo is Android things now, right?
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.820]   Did that change that?
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:21.820]   Oh, sorry.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:22.820]   Yes.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.820]   Yes.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.740]   The only reason I know is because we talked about this on the new screensavers before the
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.740]   break.
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.740]   Right.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.660]   So yeah, so they just redid that.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.700]   And in fact, you can download that and run it on a Raspberry Pi.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.980]   But again, that's full stack Linux, right?
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.820]   I'm running on a Raspberry Pi.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.220]   It's not microcontroller firmware like you would want to run in these devices.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:50.140]   You can see why this is a so annoying and complicated to consumers that they just could
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.700]   throw up their hands and say, I'm not going to.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.020]   This is why it hasn't caught on.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.740]   And B, you could see why journalists are having a hard time covering it.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.020]   It's a, I mean, this is your beat, Stacy.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.020]   You picked this.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.020]   Are you nuts?
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.020]   I love it.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.020]   Okay.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.700]   I used to, I used to cover semi conductor manufacturing.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.700]   Okay.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.700]   So this is very similar.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.420]   I'm like, I used to write about low K die electics, you guys.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.660]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.660]   All right.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.060]   So let's talk about actual things then.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.500]   Yeah, let's talk about fun devices.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.620]   You saw, I mean, one of the things from a distance, it was clear that Amazon voice services
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.820]   really was one of the big winners at CES.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.660]   They were everywhere, weren't they?
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.660]   Dozens of devices.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.660]   Yes.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.060]   She who shall not be named was everywhere.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.580]   She was in these, even in, in echo like devices.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.020]   So we saw Lenovo's prettier, better speaker.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.620]   It just looked like an echo with nice fabric around it.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.620]   Is it a better speaker?
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.620]   Why not?
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.620]   It has better.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.820]   So the big complaint against echo is it's kind of not enough base.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.300]   This has boom, boom.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.900]   And it's 20 bucks less.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.060]   And it is 20 bucks less.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.140]   But Amazon doesn't care because they, they make money.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.860]   They're kind of an interesting googly kind of position in all of this.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:12.700]   They make money if you use it because most of the time people buy doll houses and they
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.700]   finance the whole.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.700]   Okay.
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.700]   Can we just talk about that?
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.700]   Okay.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.700]   Just for a brief second.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.700]   All right.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.700]   Everybody knows this story by now.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.700]   I'm not sure what you're looking for.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:29.180]   But a station in San Diego did a story about a six year old who inadvertently or maybe
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:35.980]   even advertently bought a dollhouse using her parents Amazon Echo and apparently they
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.300]   listened back to the recordings because as you know, echo saves the recordings.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.740]   And she just said, Oh, let's play in the good.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:46.580]   And then apparently four pounds of sugar cookies in the dollhouse arrived two days later.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:52.380]   So they did the story and then the anchor said, gee, I wish I could say echo by me,
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:59.900]   a dollhouse and people according to the news all over San Diego, their echoes suddenly
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.300]   ordered dollhouses.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   That's got to be apocryphal, right?
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.140]   Is that what you're about to say, Stacy?
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.620]   Well, the first part, I can see how that happens, but you have to confirm a purchase
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.220]   like see how a kid playing would be like, yeah, yeah, whatever, you know, and you have to
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.220]   give it a pin.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.100]   Well, no, you don't.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.900]   So when you said I do, so when you set up your echo, you are automatically opted into
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.060]   buying stuff, but you do have to confirm it.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.500]   So that's step one to avoid this.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   But the pin is not there by default.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   Right.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.700]   Two, you can set a passcode.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.260]   And I highly recommend you guys do, even though it is the least secure thing to give
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.100]   of what because she asks you what's your passcode and then you're like, it's, you know, one,
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.460]   two, three, four.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.060]   And then your kid who's sitting right there now knows the passcode.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.980]   So I'm kind of like, is this secure?
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.540]   I suspect that's what happened.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.540]   I am.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.700]   I have heard conflicting stories.
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.340]   I've asked my audience if the pin is on by default or not.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.780]   I just not.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.940]   Here's what my guess is.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.740]   It was not earlier on.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.700]   Oh, it is now, but I believe it is now.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:09.980]   And I know, I don't remember ever putting a pin on my stuff, but it does have a pin.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.460]   So I think they changed at some point is what happened.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.380]   Okay, because I was in the, I was in that initial December and once you buy one and set
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.340]   it up, you're stuck forever.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.340]   Not stuck.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:29.140]   So, so I've seen actually online terms of service that say a pin is required.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.580]   I, I'm not sure.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.940]   So is anybody, here's the thing.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.060]   I'll ask the chat room.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:40.860]   Has anybody bought installed a, an Amazon Echo or a dot in the last, you know, month?
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.700]   And what did, does it have a pin or not?
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.660]   These people are saying, no, they're saying it's not changed.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.140]   Um, they just looked at the registration page.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.140]   So, okay.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.620]   So what did your chat rooms excited about?
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.620]   Risk five.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.300]   I'm going to talk to them later.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   All right.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.300]   Sorry.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.580]   I don't even, you mean R.I.S.C reduced destruction set computing?
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.580]   Yes.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.020]   It's an open source computing project.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.380]   And there's a fifth, the fifth generation.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.380]   All right.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.780]   So no, no, yes.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.780]   See, yes.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:10.780]   It's possible.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:16.820]   It is possible that, that, that people all over San Diego, the, the news anchor ordered
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.420]   at dollhouse.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.820]   It is possible because if you don't have the pin and you could, but okay.
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:27.100]   But you still say, are you sure you want to buy this or do you want to buy this?
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.100]   Yes.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.100]   Yes.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.300]   So that's, that was my thing.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.620]   I'm like, God news.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.700]   We're so credulous and stupid sometimes.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:37.700]   Okay.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:43.100]   But, and we've, but see, we've known this because our, our audience are early adopters.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.540]   They all, many of them have echoes.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.900]   And we've had this problem for a year.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.900]   At least.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.900]   Yes.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.900]   That we can't say the word.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.060]   So we've known about this for a while, but I think it's probably it was an overblown story.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.940]   No, nonetheless, everybody loves it.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.940]   It's a cute story.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.700]   So, all right.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.700]   Let's take a break.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.140]   I want to talk about more hardware.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.060]   We can talk about risk five if that's what floats your boat.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.060]   Yep.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.740]   We could tell anything you're in a mood to.
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.700]   I, you know, this is our first chance to talk IOT at CES.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.900]   You're the experts, Stacy.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.140]   So, and it's, it's actually nice.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.380]   I'm going through my things.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.020]   It's nice that we have Aaron here because of course, as a maker, he's deals with a lot
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.500]   with these chipsets and with his technologies all the time.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.620]   So, and you've built quite a few IOT handmade IOT devices right Aaron.
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.780]   From scratch, we showed those off on the new screen savers as well.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.220]   I'm working right now actually on a, on a simple relay.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.060]   I call it a simple Internet of Things switch, which has a small microcontroller on it in
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.060]   a relay.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:45.180]   And you can program it easily and, you know, stick it in your, stick it in your wall behind
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.180]   your, your thing.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.460]   And you can program it yourself to do whatever you want to do.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.980]   Now of course, you know, it's not going to be for an average Joe user, but at least it
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.660]   gives you an option to do something different or to conform to whatever API you want to
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.660]   conform to.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:08.140]   I feel like that even with all the progress we've made in the consumerification of IOT,
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.020]   really anybody who's trying to integrate all this, everybody's got one or two things
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.500]   on integrated, you know, things.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.940]   But the people who are integrating this stuff are more like Aaron, where they're, well,
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.860]   I've built a little device here that I've plugged in.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:25.700]   I mean, it is not yet a consumer easy to use technology, even with the hubs.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.460]   I think we still have a way to go.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.460]   Yep.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.340]   Let's talk about robotics because one of the things that was announced and shown for the
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.060]   very first time at CES was Curry.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.860]   Did you get to see a little curry, the real live robot pal?
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.860]   Isn't it cute?
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.860]   It's so cute.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.940]   It's not coming out to like November.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.940]   I know.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.940]   I know.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.260]   But I, you know, and we're trying to get them to bring one up here.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.020]   This is our new sponsor.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.020]   The story is interesting.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.260]   Oh, sorry.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.980]   I will come to the studio to play with.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.620]   I know you will.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.700]   And you know, you should bring your daughter because it's exactly your daughter's size.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.700]   The kids love Curry.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.420]   Curry is just a couple of feet high.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.700]   He, it's a he, I asked them.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.900]   The company that makes it Mayfield Robox has been doing this stealth for about three
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.060]   or four years now.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.260]   They completely sneakily created this robot.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.340]   But I found out that it, they're owned by Bosch, the big German industrial company.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.980]   So there's some big bucks behind Curry.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.820]   This is not, you know, somebody in their garage.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.540]   And they've done something really interesting.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.580]   In fact, this was a trend I think it's C.E.S. because they've made Curry.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.740]   It's not humanoid.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.620]   You wouldn't confuse it with a human, but it's appealing.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.620]   It's cute.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.620]   It's got eyes.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.620]   It blinks.
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.500]   It's got, it's just, it's, it's like your little robot pal.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.960]   Curry learns your home's floor plan where the stairs are, which room belongs to who.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.700]   It learns the rhythm of your household.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.420]   It can wake you automatically, it wake you in time for work, greet you when you come home
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.420]   at night.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:57.020]   And don't worry, Curry is not, Curry is not going to talk to you.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.820]   Curry just beeps and boops, which makes, I think is part of the, part of the charm of
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.820]   Curry.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.860]   Here's what Curry, Curry sounds like.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.900]   Here's, that's the, and then there's, this is yes.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.900]   And that's no.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.900]   Yes.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:10.900]   No.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.900]   It also blinks.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:18.180]   This, I think that was inspired instead of having it, giving it a voice.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.660]   It's friendly.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.380]   So it connects to your Curry app.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.700]   You can, it does listen.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.300]   One of the things Curry does is kind of cool.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.540]   If it detects an unusually loud noise, it will go check it out.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:36.740]   And Curry has cameras and he'll send you on the app, he'll send you pictures and sound
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.140]   of what's going on, which is really awesome.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.660]   You can also use Curry to like, is the dog in the couch go look Curry and Curry, when you're
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.740]   not home, Curry will check for you.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.460]   It'll check if there's somebody at the door.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.740]   You can listen to songs, audiobooks, podcasts.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:59.220]   You can say, Curry, go into the kids room and read it a story, read the kid story.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.900]   She'll connect to any entertainment hub you have in your home.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.340]   I really love it.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:08.780]   Adorable Curry wants to be your friend and you can pre-order it right now.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.020]   Curry will be $699.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:18.700]   But if you, you can do a refundable pre-order of $100, pay $599 on shipping.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.340]   So you're not, you're not, you're not on the hook until the Curry ships.
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:27.420]   As you said, Stacy, later this year, find out more about Curry at the website.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.180]   Hey, Curry.com.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.220]   Hey, Curry.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.460]   Let me do that with what I just did again, Carsten, because this is kind of cool.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.380]   We're going to look into Curry's brain.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:45.460]   Hey, this is the cap touch sensor, capacitive touch sensors, let it respond to the human
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.460]   touch attack.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.460]   Smart.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:53.380]   So if you touch Curry on his head, I'm sorry, he'll look up at you and chirp in a nice way
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.180]   saying, he'll say, hi, I think it's smart to do that.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.100]   Because I think what happens is like with a pet, we anthropomorphize and we give Curry
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.860]   more personality if it doesn't have as much to begin with.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.300]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.860]   It's got HD camera, video and stills.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.020]   The array, you can nod.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:16.420]   It's got what they call gestural mechanics with head and eye movements that look fluid
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   and natural.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.420]   I just can't wait.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.700]   Yeah, we'll get one up here and you can play with it.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.660]   It's got array mics, a little heartlight like E.T. that can light up.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.580]   So I mean, I just, they've been really thinking about this.
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.580]   Nice speakers.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.580]   Sounds good.
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.340]   Did you see Curry when you were at the?
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.340]   I did.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.340]   Really cute.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.340]   Hey, so here's the deal.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.340]   Hey, Curry.com, H-E-Y K-U-R-I.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.540]   That's how you spoke, Curry.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   K-U-R-I.com.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.700]   Check out Curry.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.060]   Pre-order, $100 down.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.340]   It's refundable, by the way.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.540]   When it's time for charging, he, I keep wanting to say she goes right to his little charging
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.620]   pad and takes a power nap.
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.700]   So he's always ready to go.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.780]   Your little robot pal who's fun to be with.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.540]   Hey, Curry, H-E-Y K-U-R-I.com.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:10.380]   I really, when they called and said, you know, we'd like to do some ads because we were really
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.060]   excited about this and we want to kind of get the word out.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.060]   I said, "Are you kidding?
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.060]   This is awesome."
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.420]   So, I want my, it is awesome.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:23.740]   I want my robots to have arms because until my robot can, you know, do laundry or put dishes
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.740]   away from like-
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.740]   I know.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.780]   Did you see the laundry machine, the folding machine that they had?
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:30.900]   I went and looked for it.
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.180]   I didn't see it, but you know, two or three of the smart homes had pepper and I don't
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.820]   know if you've seen pepper.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.820]   What's pepper?
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.500]   She's, she is from, it's the French robotics company.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.740]   It starts with an A.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:45.740]   Aldebaran.
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.740]   Yes, Aldra.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.740]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.100]   It sounds like a Star Wars planet.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.100]   Aldebaran.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:56.340]   So, pepper was everywhere demoing inside people's smart home setups.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:01.300]   And I was so excited because I thought pepper was going to like do things, but she was just
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.140]   to attract like, she was like the equivalent of a bootstrape.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:09.340]   And this is why, yeah, a robot, this is why I think that Curry's smart not to have arms
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.820]   and a big voice and stuff because it promises more that can deliver, right?
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.820]   Right.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.300]   This just does, you know, this doesn't do anything.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.780]   It looks like it should do something, but all I can do is, you know-
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.260]   Come on, non-side.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.260]   It does things, but yeah, it's not as cool as you would think.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.260]   Not anything useful.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.500]   It doesn't mix you a drink.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   That would be useful.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   All right.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:35.180]   So, I think that as we start these things off in the early days, it would be better not
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.420]   to do, not to imply you could do so much.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.660]   Here's some more video of Curry from the IEEE Spectre.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.380]   Wait, no, that's a- That's an expensive- Oh, I'm sorry, pepper not curry.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.940]   That's an expensive toy, if you ask me.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.220]   Well, even their smaller one.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.740]   And when you guys were talking about Curry, I didn't want to bring it up during the ad,
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:01.980]   but you know, the same company also makes the now and NAO robot as well.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.620]   It's been out for a while, but I still think even that one, which is about the size of the
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.820]   Curry, I think it's like five, $6,000 or something.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.820]   Wow.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.580]   But it does have arms and legs.
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:17.980]   And in fact, I saw the now- I went to Cirque du Soleil in San Francisco.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:23.180]   And as part of their pre-show, there was these robots up on stage and they were doing
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.180]   all sorts of stuff.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.180]   And I said, that's a now.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.940]   I'd tell my wife, and my wife didn't care, but I was like, hey, that's a now.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.740]   They just put like silver paint on it and stuff.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.820]   And we had one of the reps for them come out and do a demonstration at our makerspace.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.380]   They are pretty cool, but they're cool.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.820]   They don't really, like you said, they don't fold the laundry.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.020]   They don't provide healthcare.
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.820]   They don't, you know, anything that you might want a robot to do.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.980]   So I think we've still got a long way to go to get to that point.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.980]   I think these are just-
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.700]   Now is greeting people in a Hilton hotel.
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.700]   It's their demo.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.060]   Okay, it might be a Hyatt.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.140]   It's a Hilton or Hyatt.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.500]   It's a deal with IBM.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.460]   So now stands up on the desk as in Czechs.
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.460]   Hello.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.460]   You can check you in at his house here.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.460]   I am now.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.460]   Welcome to the hotel.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.460]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.660]   So in the Westworld is ain't yet, right?
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.140]   I'm okay with that though.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.220]   Yes, I agree.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.580]   You saw what happened in Westworld.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.580]   I'm not.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.460]   It's, you know, don't give now a gun.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.620]   Let's just say that.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.420]   So see, yes, I'm going to do categories.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:34.780]   There were lots of things for wellness and a lot of things for breathing into stuff and
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.780]   detecting.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.780]   So mint detects if you have bad breath.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:43.860]   You breathe into this like thing and you go, and it's like, whoa, back off.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.420]   Or so that's one.
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.620]   They're selling this, by the way.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.620]   They do.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.260]   This is introducing mint by measuring the organic compounds in your mouth released by
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.260]   various bacteria.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.900]   It can monitor your oral health.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.940]   See, that's more interesting than just saying you have bad breath.
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.500]   It could say you got the beginnings of ginger vitis or something.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.700]   I mean, that would be more useful, right?
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.940]   Or you're sort of, yeah.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.740]   Or well, if you do something about it.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.060]   I'd like, I would be fine.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.420]   Just be like, God, don't talk to anybody, Stacy.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.260]   Go brush your teeth.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.300]   Maybe, maybe with the like ginger vitis stuff, the insurance company will buy it.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.300]   I don't know.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:28.860]   So there was also a company called level now, L-E-V-L now.com, and they checked for, I think
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.780]   it's the acetone in yours.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.740]   Oh, that's for ketosis.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.380]   It's for ketosis, yes.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.300]   So it's detecting if you're burning enough.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.580]   This is not a thing for burning fat.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.940]   This is a community association management.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:41.940]   I do.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.580]   No, it's missing an E. So L-E-V-L now.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.140]   Oh, you see the internet, we're running out of vowels.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.140]   That's the path.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.660]   I could use that though for my diabetes.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.140]   That would be good.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.140]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:01.260]   Well, because ketoacidosis is actually a very dangerous condition that you can get
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.980]   into with diabetes.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.940]   But this would, oh, so yeah, so it's for weight loss.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.580]   So it's to help you go into ketosis, safe ketosis for weight loss.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.580]   Interesting.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.700]   Which is there, because there are lots of kids with epilepsy, there actually is a diet
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.180]   for migraine people, people who suffer for migraines.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:28.020]   And that if you're on a super low ketosis diet, I don't know what the right ketogenic
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.020]   diet I think is what it is.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.020]   Ketogenic, that's right.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.020]   Yes.
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.580]   So this could be useful there.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.140]   So this looks really good.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.020]   I'm going to sign up right now for this.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.020]   Oh, dear.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.020]   Oh, dear.
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.580]   Oh, dear.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.300]   This one is also good.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.300]   Or let me say interesting.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.900]   It's called, what is it called?
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.220]   Life, L-I-E-F therapeutics.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.060]   And the website is getleaf, L-I-E-F dot com.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.060]   Is it I scan an avian boy going to come to my house?
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.820]   No, that would be.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.820]   That would be life.
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.060]   Sorry, I missed the bill.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.420]   That would be life.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:00.420]   Life therapeutics.
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.420]   Hi.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.060]   I would buy that.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.340]   This is leaf as in relief.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.340]   I saw the ad for this.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.180]   It's a biosensing patch.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.180]   Yes.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:15.060]   And you know, I will say with all of these, there's a fine line between wellness and actual
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.060]   therapeutics, right?
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:20.540]   And there has to be, because the FDA gets involved as soon as it makes health recommendations
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.940]   or becomes a therapeutic device.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.380]   And you know, this could be so much snake oil, but this was interesting because it looked
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.300]   at your, you wear it as a patch right underneath your chest.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:37.060]   And it detects when you're stressed and you're supposed to do biofeedback.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:41.820]   And it's supposed to help improve people who are depressed or anxious.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.180]   It's supposed to start training you.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.940]   It's actually can be used with CBT, which is a cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:55.180]   It's a treatment that I know, because I have a member of my family who uses CBT to control
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.580]   mental illness.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:02.340]   And so it's the idea is to give you tools to control your mood, your, your anxiety,
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.860]   so that you can without medication kind of get an even keel.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.940]   So having some, like a, something to say, hey, your anxiety level is going up because you
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.100]   don't always notice it would be very helpful.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.100]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.100]   So that was that.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.220]   And then there were like nine breast pumps there and, you know, I'm sorry.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.220]   I'm a man.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.220]   I'm going to giggle.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.220]   I apologize.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.220]   That shouldn't giggle.
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.220]   There's nothing.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.220]   As a woman.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.820]   I nurse my daughter.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:33.900]   Let me just tell you, breast pumps are the most archaic medieval things out there.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:39.260]   I remember, I remember doing this with Jennifer when Abby was born and it was painful.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.780]   It was in a, and I'm watching this happen.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.100]   And I'm thinking that does not, that was invented by a man.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.100]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.100]   Yes.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.100]   You feel like a cow.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.100]   A cow.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.660]   So it's probably derived from the same devices used on cows.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.660]   Probably.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.660]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.580]   It's, it's a similar, I mean, it's a similar process.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:03.100]   So, but my favorite was this company.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.260]   It's called Willow.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.260]   And what these are.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.980]   Are you expecting Stacy?
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.860]   Is there a reason you have this?
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.940]   No, I just, like I said, I nurse my daughter for 18 months.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.940]   So you're interested.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.100]   The whole time I was like technology.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:21.060]   Well, for the, for one thing, this looks a lot less like the kind of thing you milk
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:28.340]   a cow with and much more, well, like a, like a bra, like something that would fit you comfortably.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.780]   It fits in your brain.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.940]   So this is probably TMI for your P is like many of people in your audience, but I'm just
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.900]   going to tell you, when you breast, when you pump, you like have to take off your
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.740]   clothes, you're like, there's apparatuses.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.740]   There's tubes.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.900]   There's like giant pump.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.940]   That's like this big, you guys.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.500]   This is literally a shell and noisy.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.500]   It's like.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.140]   And then there's the engine in the back.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.140]   It's.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.060]   So you can't do it in the office and be discreet.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.620]   This is not a discreet process.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.460]   But this one, if it's in your bra, you could.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.220]   If it's in your bra, it's quiet.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.220]   It's, it's, yes, I was like, it may be.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.220]   Oh, this is great.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.220]   I wanted to go out and get pregnant and try it.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.220]   I was like, yes.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.220]   Wow.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.220]   Look at that.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.100]   Oh, this is going to be huge.
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.620]   Isn't this funny how we've suffered for so long with really primitive technology?
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.260]   That hasn't probably changed in a hundred years.
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:26.740]   And this, of course, has its ties into your smartphone.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.860]   So you can, it has a milk tracking app.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.380]   I'm not making that up.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.380]   So I was.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.700]   I'm glad they mentioned this.
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.300]   Willow is for women.
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.300]   Okay.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:41.060]   You know, I, I'm not going to go there.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.740]   But I'm guessing it was made by a woman.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.500]   And that's the, you know, the one thing you immediately think when you look at this, the
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.060]   predecessors is no woman designed this.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.780]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.780]   And it'll be out.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.300]   So they're targeting, I believe the June timeframe for this.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.420]   And FDA approval.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.420]   And FDA approval.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.420]   They already have it.
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.780]   Yeah, they have it.
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:06.460]   The key for this will be to, for widespread folks will be getting insurance to cover it.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:12.580]   So, but the more, the more people who buy it, the more likely insurance is to cover it.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.820]   Is it expensive?
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.780]   It costs about as much as a normal breast pump is the aim.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.780]   So that's right.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.460]   Well, I think we rented, we didn't buy because they are expensive.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.100]   I think we rented one and you're not going to use it for more than a year.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.420]   So I think we could use it for as long as you learn.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.420]   You could use it.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.420]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.420]   And that's roughly a year.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.860]   I mean, you didn't nurse till she was seven.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.100]   I nurse for 18 months.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.340]   Okay, you're in a half.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.340]   Fine.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.340]   That's roughly a year.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.340]   All right.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.940]   Yeah, she's not that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.340]   I was like, there's a whole movement of women who do.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.700]   I know there is.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.340]   And it's a mold fashion enough that it shocks me when a four year old comes up and says,
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.180]   I'd like to eat now, mommy, mommy.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:00.900]   So I have one for Erin, I saw these guys again and I love them.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.260]   So this is what's the next thing.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.260]   They make a nine dollar board.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:12.100]   So the chip, they actually introduced a more powerful $16 board that I think has, I think
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.180]   it may be Wi-Fi integrated on it.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.700]   Yeah, I'll have to double check.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.940]   The first one had Wi-Fi.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.660]   This is what it looks like right here.
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.540]   That's the original chip.
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.180]   We've had the chip folks on.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.900]   In fact, we had them on when they invented it.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.420]   They went on Kickstarter and they brought it when they came out.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:34.380]   Oh, I remember that thing right here, this thing, that is the great chip.
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:39.060]   And that is a six dollar chip that is the brains behind the chip board, like the new
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.060]   more powerful board.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.940]   Sorry, that's the chip pro as well.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.820]   This is rapid.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:49.780]   Kind of like the American Raspberry Pi, Erin or?
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.780]   Yeah, yeah, to some extent.
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:57.020]   I got the pocket chip, which is cool because you get a terminal and a Linux command and
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.380]   you can actually reprogram the games on it.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.380]   Right.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.380]   The pocket chip was really cool.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.940]   I mean, I think that really helped them out when they launched this a few years ago.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:10.940]   But yeah, it runs Linux and we're going to talk about a similar product later on, but
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:16.060]   it runs Linux, you can connect to peripherals, you can hook up other things.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:20.420]   And you know, with the original model being nine dollars and it's Wi-Fi enabled, you
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.100]   know, there's a lot you can do with it.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.620]   Now it doesn't come.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.540]   It's kind of hard to hook up like an HDMI display and things like that.
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:31.900]   So, you know, there's some, you got to kind of pick where you think the Raspberry Pi is
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.100]   really good at.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.460]   It's really a full computer ready to go out the door.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.460]   You can hook up an HDMI display and go.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.500]   But it's not six dollars.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.500]   Well, the, I mean, the five dollars is five dollars.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.500]   Yeah.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   So I zero is five.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.500]   Wow.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.500]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.700]   So I thought that was pretty cool.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:54.980]   All right, you want crazy smart home stuff or should I stop bringing stuff to you?
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.780]   No, continue on.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.780]   I'm having fun.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.780]   This is all cool stuff.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:41:59.780]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.780]   Okay.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.380]   I have to make fun of it because it was ridiculous.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.140]   Look up the Moen.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.140]   Let's see.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.340]   I don't know where you're going to find it.
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.820]   It's the Moen faucetless shower.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:15.220]   It's a, it's a $1,300 shower, just Moen and CES and you'll find the visuals for it,
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.460]   I'm sure.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:23.980]   So what Moen did, Moen makes these beautiful faucets and yeah, faucets.
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:24.980]   I have Moen.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.540]   Everybody has Moen, right?
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.540]   In their house, right?
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.540]   It's one of the big names.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.540]   It's lovely.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.420]   So they replaced the, the turning on.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.140]   Is that the one that you have where you tap your faucet?
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.740]   So, oh, that's, I do that.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.180]   So that's capacitive touch and that's a delta faucet.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.660]   Moen does have a capacitive touch faucet too.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:44.660]   Okay.
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:49.060]   But this is a app to go with your shower.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.860]   Oh, I don't need an app in this shower.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:57.620]   The button, it's, they replaced the faucet with a button pad that has four buttons on
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.820]   it and a little screen.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.220]   There it is.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.820]   And it gives you a customized shower.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.540]   So everyone was making fun of the IoT here.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.540]   This is the you.
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.540]   Yes.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:07.540]   Okay.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.540]   Is that what it's called?
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.540]   Just the letter you.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.540]   Shower.
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.540]   Like never before.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:14.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:15.540]   This is the you video.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.780]   It's you for you and your shower.
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.300]   It's you only wetter.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.300]   So this goes in the shower is waterproof.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.300]   Yes.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.300]   Your phone.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   Your phone, wait, I don't understand.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.300]   Is your phone, your phone is outside the shower.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   Your phone is outside the shower.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.620]   Oh, it's got colors.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.220]   You can pause your shower.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:49.140]   This seems like maybe it's going a little far.
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.980]   This is this is a perfect example of put a chip in it philosophy.
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.980]   Just wait a year.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:56.980]   Just wait a year.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.300]   Shower gets hacked.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.700]   I can see high end, you know, or mid range to high end hotels putting this in, you know,
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.580]   their luxury suite stuff.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.580]   Something like that.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:10.860]   By the way, here's some good news with the connection to the show to the cloud and all
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.380]   showers should be connected to the cloud.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:17.820]   A future updates to you by mowing shower set up as automatic, automatic firmware updates
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.260]   for your shower, folks.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.020]   That's what you've been missing.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.020]   Oh, holy.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:28.740]   So I did ask if I could tell the echo, Hey, run me 110 degrees of shower and they said,
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.700]   no, that's not there.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.260]   See, that's perfect that I would want.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.260]   That's a lot of cool.
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.580]   So essentially it could do that, but right now what they've done is basically, and they've
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.740]   taken it away.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.980]   There is no more faucet.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.020]   There's no knob.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.580]   It's all those buttons.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.580]   You're right.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.580]   You're Aaron, you nailed it.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.620]   Some high end hotel will have this, you know, the Aria in Vegas or something.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.620]   Right.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.620]   Exactly.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.620]   The wind to go with their echoes.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.860]   I agree with you though, Stacey.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.180]   You gave them a very good idea.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.500]   Echo turn on my shower 109 degrees, please.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.000]   Mm hmm.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.700]   I have no idea how hot my showers are, but with this, I look.
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.140]   Well, I think it's a little hot.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.620]   I think you, I think that's scalding hot.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.260]   Not, it wouldn't hurt you, but it would be very hot.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.260]   Okay.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:21.060]   Well, I, I want you're more of a hundred, seven hundred eight kind of person.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.060]   Got it.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.060]   I like that.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.060]   All right.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.140]   But that's what that's the beauty of it.
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:31.100]   You could actually say no, because Lisa likes much hotter shower than I do.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:37.960]   And so she, you know, very, very gently turns the, the heat down before I get in, which
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.560]   is very nice of her, you know, because what, because she has it really high.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:46.360]   We have a, we have a lever that goes hot to cold.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.000]   And but I just know where it is on the wall.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.840]   Like, oh, it's three, it's about three o'clock.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.400]   If it's a three o'clock, then it's the right temperature.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   Right.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.560]   And usually they take a little bit to heat up, like unless you've got an instant hot water
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.560]   heater.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:04.020]   And it's cool to be able to say Lisa's is 110, mine's 107.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.020]   That would be really cool.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.020]   All right.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.020]   Wait a year.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.020]   And I bet Moen has that for you.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.020]   And you can install this thing in your shower.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.020]   I would actually buy that.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.020]   Okay.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.020]   Yep.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:15.020]   If, but it has to, I have to be able to tell it to echo.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.700]   That's why these voice things are so important because the hub is everything.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:23.020]   The ability to communicate with these things in a natural way is everything.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.020]   Right.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.860]   I think what else?
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.960]   And it's the auto learning mechanism too that will eventually come.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.960]   Right.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.960]   Right.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:32.960]   It should, I don't even have to learn it.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.320]   I just tell it what I want.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.320]   It figures it out.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.160]   We're, we're going to go there eventually.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.160]   All right.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.360]   Other things that I thought were cool.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.800]   This is so fun Stacy.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   Thank you for bringing this.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   This is awesome.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.800]   This is great.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   I'm like, I'm running out of stuff, but this is the view of C. Yes, we didn't see.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   I like it.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   Smarter.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   Smarter companies.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   So they make the eye kettle, which actually was in the news because I think it was hacked.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.980]   I'll just, I'll just be right up there.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.220]   They did have that.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.220]   They fixed it.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.220]   What happens if your kettle gets hacked?
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.220]   Somebody.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.220]   It did.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.740]   Ruse coffee without your knowledge.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.260]   I was going to say they burn the water.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.860]   I don't remember the hack.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.460]   Everything's been hacked.
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:13.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.460]   But that's the bigger.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.940]   By the way, I just want to say this, the bigger problem with IoT hacking is not that
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.940]   you're going to, somebody's going to turn on your coffee pot remotely, but that they're
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:25.700]   going to use it as a gateway into your network and then be able to plant stuff onto your
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:32.040]   network because this device is on your Wi-Fi and can be used if it's, if it's got a security
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.800]   flaws to get into your network.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.080]   We can talk about those devices I saw too.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.440]   Oh, good.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.880]   So Smarter launched a fridge cam.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:42.880]   Everybody, woo.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.880]   No, no, no.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.480]   I'm excited about fridge cams.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.960]   So this is like $149.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.520]   How much could be going on in the fridge that you'd really want to see?
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.940]   This is so you can check to see if you're out of milk or do I need to pick up this or
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.540]   did my teenage son eat the last of the cereal?
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:03.820]   That is the ultimate first world problem.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.460]   It is, but you know what?
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.820]   First world has a lot of money and they want to know what's in their fridge.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.740]   I just can't, I don't want to get up.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.300]   Just tell me what's in the fridge.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:19.060]   Well, if you tie it to Alexa, then you could, I'm seeing an echo.
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:24.640]   You could say echo, did Henry drink all the milk and echo would say, I see you're down
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.920]   to a quarter of a gallon Leo and echo, could you order me some more milk?
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.160]   It'll be on your doorstep tomorrow morning.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   That would be cool.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.160]   Well, this is, that's what I was thinking.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:38.640]   And this is kind of like, I mean, imagine, you know, Amazon's convenience store thing
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   that they're doing, right?
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.200]   I mean, this is kind of like your own personal Amazon convenience store.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   Could you take this out?
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   Right.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.200]   Figures it out.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.200]   It orders it for you.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:51.460]   It says, expiry dates, expiration dates, recipes, notifications.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.940]   And somebody can point out, you don't, it's handy not when you're home, but when you're
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.580]   at work and you want to know, do I have enough eggs?
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.860]   Andy, when you're at the grocery store and you're like, Oh, crap.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:02.540]   Do I need to pick up this?
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.540]   Yep.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.300]   I've thought for a long time about building a barcode scanner system attached to the fridge
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.260]   so that every time you put something in, you know, when you buy it, you scan it, put
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.260]   it in.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.900]   And then when you take it out, you scan it or whatever and it tracks this stuff.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.520]   It's very similar to this, but it's kind of hard to do.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.280]   It's hard to catch all the corner cases.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.600]   So is there a light on this fridge?
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   You can't because John.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:27.980]   So it's when you open it because other thing to know is Wi-Fi and your fridge is basically
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.480]   a giant Faraday cage.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.480]   All right.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.240]   So when you open it because it doesn't change while it's not open.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.240]   That was coming in.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.240]   Then you have real problems.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:43.400]   I suddenly realized, Oh yeah, the only time the fridge contest changes when the doors
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   open.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.400]   It's a hundred pounds.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.840]   You can preorder it now.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:48.840]   Yes.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:52.000]   So Aaron, I have something for you with your barcode scanner.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.280]   It is the Gini can G E and I can.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:01.800]   So the idea here is it was going to be a trash can, but then that didn't work.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:06.560]   So they are just created a camera that you stick near your waistband, waist bin and you
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.920]   can it's got a barcode scanner.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:13.160]   So you can scan the products as you toss the package or recycle it.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:17.040]   And I think you can also talk to it to put things on a shopping.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.840]   I think I entered the wrong thing because I have a Kegel fitness device for you.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.280]   Oh, that's the Vibri.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   Someone did ask about that.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.280]   We can talk about that.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.680]   Gini can is G E N I G A N.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.680]   Okay.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.320]   The Vigini is it's a vibrator that they basically turned into like a Kegel exercise.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.920]   Oh, I got it.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   Okay.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:44.320]   So Gini can makes your trash can smart.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.880]   And it's plugged into Amazon dash replenishment.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:52.320]   So when you throw stuff away, it automatically orders it.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.520]   Okay.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.520]   Let's talk trash.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.520]   All right.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.280]   Grocery lists are such a pain.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.000]   They're impossible to maintain and they lack detail.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Talk about.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.240]   That is create that is really creating a problem that does not exist.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   Okay.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.240]   All right.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:13.560]   So it scans what I throw in the trash can.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.200]   And you can talk to it and say buy more milk.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.200]   If you want.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.200]   Grocery lists are.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.200]   All right.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   Let's see it.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   Okay.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   Gini can add.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   Oh, you don't have to like you can just throw it in.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.560]   Say you want to add ketchup to your shopping list.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.080]   I feel like you might have to do a little bit more.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.280]   Why not at it while you're there?
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.080]   Okay.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.080]   Okay.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.200]   So she held it up to the.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:45.000]   The things hanging on a lip on your trash can and before she throws it in, she puts the
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.440]   barcode in front of it goes, but I think and now it's on your list.
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.440]   Right.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.520]   And then you can also talk to it and reorder stuff.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.880]   Oh, you can.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:54.880]   I think it.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.880]   Yes.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.880]   Voice recognition.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:57.880]   So okay.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.800]   We've come a long way if this works because I remember I had a grocery list thing five
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.640]   years ago where you talk to something like that.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.840]   It was terrible.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.480]   Do you remember it?
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.440]   I have I tested the haiku.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   It had some challenges.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.000]   So maybe this is better.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.600]   We have gotten better for certain.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.700]   So imagine this.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.360]   So dash replenishment, right?
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.360]   That's pretty cool.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:25.800]   Or you just send your barcode in order to Instacart.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.200]   Like it's just happening.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.520]   Look at you don't even have to and then boom, it's there.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.360]   You probably want to tell them, hey, wait till I have 10 items or something, right?
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.360]   Well, yes.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.560]   Maybe maybe you do it up until like I would check my Instacart order before I sent it
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:44.080]   on because, you know, sometimes you use stuff and you're like, I will never buy that credit.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.320]   I just found the killer feature.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.520]   It'll even text your teenager when the can is full.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.440]   Oh, there you go.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.000]   It tells your kid to empty the trash.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.680]   That's awesome.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.680]   Sold.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.320]   125 bucks for the genie can.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.680]   That's not bad.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   No.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:09.240]   I mean, that's well within crazy early adopter device spending range.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.520]   I love it that it ties into the Amazon bash.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.520]   See?
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.520]   All right.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   Let's see.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.520]   Should I buy this?
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.160]   It was what do you think?
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.360]   Should I?
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.120]   You don't want to be afraid of.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.320]   In fact, I know this would happen like the first day.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.160]   It would get thrown out with the trash.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.200]   Well, you don't have to stick it right on the trash can.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.920]   You could stick it near the trash can if you were worried about that.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.160]   But it wouldn't know where the trash is full if you did that.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.320]   That is true.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   Sorry.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   I know.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.320]   I know.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.560]   If you just wanted to text your teenager, there's some sensors you could just put up.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.440]   Hey, Darren, would you build me one of those?
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.440]   Sure, sure.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.440]   No problem.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.440]   In about 10 minutes.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.160]   A trash can sensor.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.720]   I'm telling you, you could make some money on that.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   Maybe?
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.720]   I could just, I just see this.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.360]   I know this is how this would go.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.720]   Hey, honey, where the genie can go?
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.080]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.280]   Maybe we threw it out.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.960]   I'm kind of emptied with the trash.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   What else?
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.960]   I laugh because I've been there.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.760]   I threw away my reding ring.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.680]   So that's a little Freudian.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.160]   No, it was accidental.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.640]   Oh, that's what you're.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.640]   No, it really.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.400]   You're just like it was an expensive ring.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.280]   No, yeah, no, I'm sure it was accidental.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:31.000]   But I'll tell you, if a guy loses his wedding ring, then it's Freudian.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.680]   No wife would ever let a guy get away with that.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.680]   Sure, honey.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.600]   Yeah, you misplaced your wedding ring.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   Yeah, sure.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:40.600]   While you were in Vegas.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:41.600]   While you were in Vegas.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.160]   Well, yeah, it does depend on the setting.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.720]   All right.
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:51.600]   One more and then, and then honey, where'd your Virginia go?
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.000]   I lost it.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   All right.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.520]   This is just cool tech.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.960]   This falls under cool technology.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.760]   I didn't see a lot other than the Qualcomm glance thing and then of this company, which
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.480]   is called Ultra Haptics.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:11.320]   And basically they are doing pushed air to create haptic feedback to create like a gesture-based
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.840]   controller is probably the best way to talk about it.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.400]   So there are demos where things like an ATM machine that you didn't have to touch.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.920]   You just stuck your hand over it and then you could enter your code.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.120]   I think they had some gambling aspects.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:31.320]   Now, we've seen, of course, this kind of thing with light.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.480]   What is the name of that launch thing that you could buy for a Macintosh?
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   Leap.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:38.480]   Leap.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   Leap.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   That's it.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.560]   So there are demos actually how to leap motion detecting your gesture and what they were doing
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.560]   is haptic feedback.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.160]   So I think I said detecting gesture.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.160]   Oh, so it's not so good.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:53.000]   So you knew if you pressed it, if you just your pressed a button, if that makes sense,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.720]   this was, you'd feel it.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.680]   So this works with the leap.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.120]   So yes, and there are demos that was working with a leap.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.720]   They could work with other camera systems.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.720]   So I thought it was-
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   What does it try it?
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:04.720]   What does it feel like?
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.960]   It feels like, oh, what does it feel like?
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.160]   It feels like someone blowing on your head like a lot of things.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.960]   Oh, a bowling alley.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:16.720]   Yeah, a bowling alley hand dryer.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.880]   Imagine it's like finer bits of that air and then you can change the presser and the
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.120]   finer kind of segments.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.160]   Does that make sense at all?
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.160]   What?
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:34.960]   So it doesn't feel like what it's supposed to be, but it's giving you feedback of some
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.960]   kind.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.400]   It's not like it's simulating an actual feeling that you would have.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.360]   No, it's a totally different feeling.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:45.400]   Oh, place a fine mesh over the bowling alley thing and control each flow of air through
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.400]   each mesh.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.400]   And so then you can-
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.400]   That's kind of cool.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.760]   I thought it was really actually pretty compelling.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.560]   So here's the thing.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.560]   Here's the thing.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:59.840]   If we combine ultra haptics with leap motion with the Moen faucet, smart faucet, nobody
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:03.760]   would ever have to touch a public restroom faucet again.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:04.760]   Yes.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.760]   Exactly.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:06.760]   See?
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.760]   Yes.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:08.760]   Or garbage.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.760]   Or garbage.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:14.160]   Or like an ATM pad or your, I mean, like think elevator buttons.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.160]   Oh.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:21.080]   Yeah, there's a lot of surfaces like that that get pretty grungy as you'll find out if you
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:26.200]   have kids my age that are doing science projects for school.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.720]   It seems like there's always a germ one.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.680]   Somebody's doing germs and they swab all these things.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.680]   You go, "Oh, that's so gross."
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.680]   Vico did that.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   So funny, Michael did that.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.440]   It was a little weird when I came into the kitchen and there were all these pet treatishes
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.920]   between the dishes and the caterer and they all grow and stuff.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:43.920]   Totally.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.120]   See what that one went, came from, "I don't want to know."
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.600]   Your toothbrush.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   Ah!
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   Hey.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.600]   All right.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:54.440]   Thank you for that IoT tour.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.040]   Is that it or you?
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.440]   I don't want to cut you off.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.560]   No, I mean, you know, it's C.S.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.160]   There's like a trillions of devices.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.160]   I'll say two things.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.200]   Air quality sensing, very, very hot.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.200]   Many devices there.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:09.200]   Yes.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   And then sleep is still.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.800]   Because they're being made in China where you can't breathe here.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.800]   Yes.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.800]   Yes.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.200]   And, oh, and I did need a lot of things that will take your job.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   Not my job.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.360]   Not your job, Leo.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.440]   Nobody could take my job.
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.440]   I don't know.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.440]   Curry might get up here and...
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.440]   Hey, Curry.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.440]   So, Lee...
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.440]   He'll tell me about what's going on in Google.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.440]   That's really...
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.440]   And it'll say...
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.960]   Oh, that's true.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   Of course, Curry would stick to Google.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   So some people might be happy.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.600]   Let's take a break.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.600]   Come back with more.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.760]   There's a lot of stories and I know we wanted to talk about the Google.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:49.440]   Hangouts, API, sad story there.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.440]   Changes at Google.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.640]   Google Tango.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.840]   Lots to talk about.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.920]   But first a word from a sponsor that's been...
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.440]   Oh, we haven't seen these guys in a while.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   We're glad they're welcome.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.440]   I'm back.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.440]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:08.280]   I think you know I've been a fan of LegalZoom forever.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:13.240]   LegalZoom helped me get this business started and helped me do the paperwork and all the
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.760]   stuff I needed to do to incorporate.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.360]   Start of a New Year is a great opportunity to hit the reset button for a fresh start
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.960]   for you, your business, your family, whether it's taking control of your family's future
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.760]   within a state plan or getting your dream business up and running.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.720]   Don't let the legal questions that you might have hold you back.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:36.200]   LegalZoom was created over 15 years ago to provide you with the tools, the confidence,
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:41.800]   the know-how to wrap up your legal needs without the expense of going to a white shoe
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:42.800]   law firm.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.320]   It's not a law firm.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.920]   LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.080]   So no hourly fees.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:51.440]   Instead you get legal advice at flat rates from the network of attorneys in 48 states.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.640]   They will help you with the right estate plan.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.160]   They will help you answer questions you have for running your business.
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.080]   And of course LegalZoom can get you all the paperwork you need, get it all done fast
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.680]   at a much lower cost.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:11.720]   I'm telling you as a regular LegalZoom user for my will, for my corporation, I am a fan
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.440]   and I have been for years.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.480]   Make 2017 the year you get your life in order.

[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   We love them.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.800]   I've been using them for years since 2005.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.160]   I've been a LegalZoom customer.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.760]   We're talking about Google this week in Google with Stacey Higgin, bottom of StaceyOnIOT.com
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.120]   back from CES.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.800]   Aaron Nukeman and I are just sitting watching.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.920]   Enjoying all the cool gadgets and stuff.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920]   That's awesome.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.920]   Yeah, really fun stuff.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.120]   I'm going to let you all talk now.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.320]   Do you go to CES every year or is this...
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.320]   Oh, I've been for three years now.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.320]   Okay.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320]   So this is...
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.320]   I had to pick it up when Kevin stopped.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.960]   So this is kind of new for you.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.000]   I asked Paul Theron who hasn't been there in five or six years.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.040]   As I said, as it changes, it's exactly the same.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.520]   So I have it because I haven't been in a few years.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.240]   We used to go to CES every year and do big...
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.880]   We'd had a big booth there and everything covered.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.800]   But the problem is we had a couple of just boring CES's in a row and I thought, "Why am
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.280]   I spending all this money to cover iPhone cases?
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.960]   I'm not that interested."
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:31.520]   But this seemed like a year with some very interesting stuff.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.520]   I think you just have to search it out.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.640]   I mean, people say that same thing about South By.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.640]   They're like, "Oh, it's so corporate now."
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640]   Right.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.480]   But I'm like, "They're always cool people doing crazy stuff pretty much everywhere."
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.720]   So I don't know.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.560]   Maybe I just find those people because I'm...
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:52.240]   You're just so positive and cool and great.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   I'm just a curmudgeon.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.440]   You should have seen me Thursday afternoon at CES.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.640]   I was like, "I'm done."
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.520]   I don't care about your Bluetooth thing.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.840]   Were there any rides and self-driving cars there for you?
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.160]   You know, I didn't do that.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.880]   The car section was huge.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.880]   Oh, I forgot about a really cool thing.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.880]   Can I tell you?
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.000]   Because it has huge, great applications for real people.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   Of course.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   Plot.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   P-L-O-T-T.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   It is a...
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   Don't tell us.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.320]   Okay, Aaron, let's play a little game.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.160]   What do you think plot does?
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.640]   I think it is a...
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.640]   Don't look at the screen.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.640]   I'm not looking.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.640]   I'm not looking.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.640]   I don't think that's actually helpful.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.640]   Without that kind of dog.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.640]   It's a...
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.640]   Oh, that's...
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.640]   It's a...
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:47.640]   It's a garden monitoring system that monitors water and soil composure.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.640]   Oh.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.800]   Oh, so the product is actually called Cubit.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   The company looks...
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.800]   No, no, no, no.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800]   That's a clue.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.800]   Don't say any more.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.800]   Cubit.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.800]   See, that goes with what I was thinking.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.640]   Because I thought it was a way to measure yourself for your cemetery plot.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.800]   And that goes right in there with a Cubit.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.160]   So what is plot really?
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.400]   It is...
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.400]   So it's...
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.400]   I'm gonna...
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.400]   Okay.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.920]   It's hard to say because it is more than just a tape measure.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.720]   I wasn't too far off, actually, wasn't it?
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.720]   It were.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.760]   So the idea behind this is it looks...
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.800]   It's got the form factor of a tape measure.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.920]   It uses lasers to detect distance like straight lines, right?
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.600]   But underneath you can't see there's a wheel and it uses that...
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.680]   It uses the wheel to do like irregular surfaces so you could roll it up if you were like measuring
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.680]   a sleeve.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:43.080]   So the device itself is about like creating accurate measurements.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:48.760]   What's cool is the software, basically it plots out where you need to put things.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.000]   So if you wanted to do like the wall of frames, this is a great example, actually.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.720]   You don't have to figure out the math of like, I want to put this here.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.040]   Just say, I want to center this in this room.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:05.600]   You take the measurements with the plot and then you roll it up the wall and it starts
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.320]   beeping when it's in the center.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.400]   Or if you want it, you know, wherever you want it.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400]   And then it also...
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.720]   Well, how do it know?
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.440]   You take a picture and it maps it.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.440]   Oh.
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.440]   This is really interesting.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.440]   Wow.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.440]   I thought this was freaking awesome.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440]   Wow.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.640]   And I don't even want to do a frame wall.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:30.840]   But like, paying these shelves behind me, they're free-formed shelves and you know, something
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.320]   like that would have been great to make sure A, it was level, B, they were in the right
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.160]   spot on the wall.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.680]   Because you can tell it where like you want to put your nails in the picture.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.680]   Oh, this is really cool.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.360]   Yeah, it is.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.640]   I mean, you would use it once every five years.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.160]   I guess if you're a contractor, you'd use it more often.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.480]   I think it was only like, I think it was like a hundred bucks or something.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.480]   Okay, so it's just as, you know, twice as expensive as a really good tape measure.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.280]   And it does the math for you.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.520]   Like, I cannot overestimate how important it is that it does the math for you.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.520]   Right.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.520]   I don't know.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.520]   I had pictures all the time.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.680]   Because you could use a laser level, for example, but you still don't know the spacing
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.080]   and wear nail things.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.880]   It's doing this in almost in three dimensions.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.480]   Oh, that's really cool.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.480]   It's pretty cool.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.480]   And you could use it for furniture placement too.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:25.520]   Or bathtub, please.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.240]   So I've seen there are apps that will, you take a picture of a room and it kind of makes
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.920]   a 3D model of it roughly accurately.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.760]   You could do measurements by taking pictures.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.960]   But I guess having the wheel makes it more accurate.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.040]   Yeah, do you see him?
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.040]   You just measured that bathtub.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.800]   And it was like, "How's it going to go?"
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   That's kind of cool.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.240]   I can see a pro getting a lot of use at this.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.320]   Or an interior designer or et cetera, et cetera.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:59.120]   What they need is to be able to do that and then upload everything into a 3D design tool
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.600]   so that you can walk into an empty space, take all your measurements.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.240]   I mean, that's basically what you do anyway, right?
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.960]   But this would automate the process.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.080]   So all your measurements and all that stuff that you want to do just gets uploaded to
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.080]   whatever tool it is.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.080]   And then you can say, "Hey, well, I want to evenly spaced.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.680]   I want to set it on the wall.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.600]   I want to up a day."
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.920]   I think that's hard to do that stuff.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.120]   You could email it to the container store and then they would plan out your perfect closet
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.840]   and then see.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.520]   Think about if you're a business like that.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   Home Depot.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   Oh.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.000]   They could send you a plot and just say, "Hey, measure it."
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Oh my God.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.600]   You send them your plot things and your Pinterest page and boom, it just comes to you now.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600]   All the things you want.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.240]   Now we're cooking with gas.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:41.200]   I wonder if they'll have a problem with the name though.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:48.240]   I mean, there's already a qubit out there, which is another microcontroller product.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.240]   I know the owner.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.840]   In fact, I think you had them on at some point.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.160]   I wonder if there's a lot of qubits out there.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:02.160]   There's probably not enough, not enough to worry about, but interesting.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.960]   And there's also qubit with cues.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.760]   Oh, yeah, the qubit.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.320]   I'm like, I don't remember.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.920]   There's a board game, I think, right, called qubit.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   Okay.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.480]   I think this is such a generic trademark now.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.720]   We don't have to worry about it.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.720]   Don't have to worry about it.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.720]   Nope.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.200]   I think it was an ancient unit of measurement, isn't it?
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.200]   It is.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.760]   The qubit, Jonah.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.680]   Remember Jonah, the Cosby routine?
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.680]   God.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.680]   Yes, Jonah.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.600]   What's a qubit?
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.600]   You don't remember that?
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   Noah.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600]   Noah.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.600]   Yeah, Jonah.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:34.600]   Noah.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   Oh, okay.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.600]   Jonah was the whale.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   Noah was the ark.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   Got it.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   Yep.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:47.840]   I would play it, but it's not really done to play Cosby routines anymore on the year.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.240]   No.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.160]   Um, finally, I used for tango.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:56.040]   Speaking of, I guess this is kind of related, Google tango.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:02.960]   Um, a partnership between, uh, Guede Go and the Detroit Institute of Arts.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.720]   When you go to the museum, you can ask for one of those Lenovo, uh, Lenovo, uh, fab
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.840]   two pros, which is a kind of the first tango phone.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.560]   And you take it and you can see on the video with the guys doing, he's looking at a mummy
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:21.400]   and then using the augmented reality on the phone to see the skeleton inside.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.760]   That is really cool.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:28.360]   So this is, I've been asking all along, well, I don't, I'm not sure I understand what you
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.480]   would use tango for.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.000]   This is probably one of the best uses of it in museums.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.080]   Yeah, and it seems like Google is really hot on developing this.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.400]   I mean, I know just cause I'm in the job market.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:46.480]   I've noticed that they're hiring several tango, you know, several people for tango, um, on
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.480]   their website.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.520]   So, um, yeah, I mean, they got to do something, right?
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.760]   I mean, the, the hardware is pretty much static at this point or, or very low incremental
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.560]   changes between hardware platforms.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:01.720]   So you got to develop the software, you got to develop or, or add something like the sensors
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.680]   to get people interested, I think at this point.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.560]   Kind of a weird, uh, story.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:12.840]   And I immediately went to my Google voice page, which because of a fi user, I had to kind
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.240]   of negotiate around to get to it.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:22.160]   A number of people pointed out to the droid life blog that there, when they went to their
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.640]   Google voice page, see, I'm going to it now and I'm getting redirected to fi.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.320]   And then I go down here and I hit click Google voice, but I'm not getting it.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.320]   No, not yet.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.320]   But they're getting it.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.320]   They're getting, you have the new Google voices here try now.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.520]   But what is the new Google voice when they tried it to pay just refresh and they got
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:51.200]   didn't get anything up newer, but Google has it has in fact confirmed that it's working
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.040]   on updates to Google voice.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:59.320]   How will you, uh, cause I, I use Google voice from the day they bought Grand Central.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.680]   That's where they got Google voice and love it.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:05.560]   And that's still the phone number I use as my main phone number.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.760]   And I've been deathly afraid that with the advent of fi and the, the deprecation of Google
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.720]   voice that it was just going to disappear.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.160]   But it sounds like Google might have plans for Google voice.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.600]   They would not tell tech crunch when, but they said they are working on updates to Google
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.600]   voice.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.800]   Yeah, that's actually really good news.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.480]   I mean, I also have been a Google voice subscribers since the beginning.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.720]   And, uh, you know, we, I use it for my, my cell phone, primary number, I use it for my
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.200]   home phone, primary number.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.480]   Um, so I never have to worry about moving or changing numbers or anything like that.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.600]   And I'll always like, ah, this is like dying to be integrated.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.600]   They finally integrated it with Hangouts.
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.240]   Several years ago, right?
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.800]   Of course now there's problems with Hangouts, but, um, you know, they finally integrated
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.360]   it with Hangouts and it's just, it's just one of those things that's just dying to be
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:59.280]   more integrated into the, the rest of the Google, uh, ecosphere, if you will.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.440]   So I can't wait to see what they're doing with it.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.880]   I just hope that they do it right and that it's something that's going to be useful.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:10.400]   Um, because that we've all been disappointed by these little, these Google rumors in the
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.120]   past.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:17.200]   Lots of people who were listeners to this show and the chat room to say, yeah, I, I would
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.480]   be devastated to lose Google voice.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.840]   And I've been worried about that especially.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.040]   See, if you get a iPhone, are you a fire user, Aaron?
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.040]   I am not.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.040]   I mean, it could be.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.040]   That was one thing that almost stopped me from doing it, but I have the pixel.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.200]   I actually had a Nexus six and I got five.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.000]   Actually I think I got five in the Nexus, uh, yeah, the Nexus six.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.920]   And, um, uh, the first thing they say is, okay, you have two choices.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.480]   You can either port your Google voice number over to make it your fine number, or you can
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.680]   say buy, buy your Google voice number.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.520]   So that, that actually held off for a while, because I knew that that was what was going
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520]   to happen.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.520]   All right.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:59.120]   And I ported it over to Google five, but so far, all the voice capabilities are still
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.120]   there.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.200]   As you saw, you go to your five page at the very bottom and click voice and you can get
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:07.320]   to your Google voice page and still do all the things Google voice does.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:12.280]   But I just felt like this is the beginning of the end crossing my fingers.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.280]   Cross in my fingers.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:14.280]   I would be sad.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.400]   I too have a Google voice number that I've had for a long time and it's my public number.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.880]   It's the number I give everybody.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.120]   Because I thought, oh, the last number I'll ever need and I'll just have it forward to
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:31.080]   whatever phone I'm using at any given moment, which is exactly what I do.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.880]   You're not a Google fight user either, Stacy.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.880]   I am not.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:36.880]   I think Jeff is.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.880]   Jeff is.
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.880]   Yes.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.880]   He talks about a lot.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.880]   It's great for traveling.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.640]   Uh, and then very sad news, I guess, and this is another one of those Google things that,
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.800]   uh, you know, they get, they're all hot and excited about it.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.840]   And then they lose interest over a couple of years.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.680]   Uh, you remember that Google Hangouts had all these wild, crazy things you could do
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:02.720]   in the Google Hangouts video calls, conference calls, uh, everything for put a mustache on
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.480]   to play ping pong.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:10.320]   Uh, Google has announced that they're going to shut down the Hangouts API, which will prevent
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:17.640]   new apps from being built and turn off all existing apps on April 25th.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:21.000]   So bye bye.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.120]   I read something interesting that makes a lot of sense to me because I've, we've complained
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:31.440]   bitterly about Google's very confused messaging over messages.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:37.660]   It's, it's, it's SMS apps, you know, Aloe isn't, can't be an SMS app, but Facebook's
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:40.520]   messenger can on Android devices.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:46.200]   Um, all Android phones come, you typically come with Google's SMS app messages and an
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:51.800]   SS, MSS SMS map called messages from the manufacturer like Samsung or LG.
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:59.560]   So I have like four or five candidates for SMS messaging, including Hangouts.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.560]   So what is Aloe?
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.560]   What is Hangouts?
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.560]   What is their intent?
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.880]   What are, which of these should I use?
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.120]   It's very messed up.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.640]   And what I read, and I think it was probably on a Reddit thread talking about this Hangouts
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.680]   API is it's probably for antitrust reasons.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.800]   Google's reluctant, that, which makes sense, right?
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.480]   That if they were to say, no, no, this is the messaging app.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.960]   Everybody uses Android should use this messaging app that that would be an antitrust problem.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.320]   Don't know, but that, that, that, I couldn't other you would.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.240]   It has to be some external force.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.280]   Surely Google knows what a hash they've done of this.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.280]   You had a whole show.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.280]   Apple has their own messaging thing.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.440]   They control their physical hardware to a greater extent than Google.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.440]   That's a very good point.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.640]   Apple does have one messaging app.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.920]   It does SMS and data messaging.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.080]   It's not cross platform.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.880]   You have to use, well, it's cross platform to the extent that it interoperates with the
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:55.880]   SMS network.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.880]   Right.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.900]   But it's, but you can't get Apple messages on Android.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.900]   So you're right.
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:02.240]   So maybe, never mind.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.440]   Because Apple's not being sued.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.960]   But Apple doesn't, isn't like the king of search and all kinds of crazy productivity apps
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:09.960]   either.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960]   So I don't know.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.000]   Anti-trust is going to be hard to determine as we come on.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.440]   Yeah, what's going to happen going forward?
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.440]   We don't know.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:24.080]   We, we are in such, it's really, I've been talking about this a lot with friends and,
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.440]   and family off the air.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.520]   It's just unknown what's going to happen in 10 days.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   What the world's going to be.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.600]   Tara, incognita.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:37.080]   I said, yeah, this morning in the chat room, I said, I, I really wonder what a year from
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.800]   now, what our top news stories will be.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:48.440]   You know, what we'll be talking about in a, on January, uh, 10th or January 11th, 2018.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.960]   Could just be like this.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.800]   Probably there'll be some Google technology that they're deprecating.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.040]   I'm like, there's deadly silence as we're all like, we can't even imagine.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.040]   We can't.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.320]   And, and, and some of us don't want to imagine.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.320]   Well, I don't want to go there.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.720]   I'm only for it to be good.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.720]   I don't know.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.760]   I'm just waiting to see what happens.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:13.440]   Uh, project are another one of those Google, uh, projects.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:18.280]   Everybody was excited about this was the Motorola R and D project, the modular camera
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.400]   that Google kept when they sold Motorola.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.520]   And of course, uh, it's gone.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.640]   Good story on Android Central of how.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.200]   Our came and went.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.480]   I loved this project.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.480]   I was so sad.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.480]   I did.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480]   Yep.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480]   I did.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.480]   No, Leo, you hated it.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.480]   You said it was stupid.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:37.480]   I was.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.800]   Cause look at this phone.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.760]   This is why look at that phone.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   Do you want that phone?
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.200]   Is that the phone you want?
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:49.800]   And remember, so our idea was you have modules, the whole phone's made up of modules and you,
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.240]   you build the phone of your dreams.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.560]   If you really want a great camera, you put that in.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.480]   If it's not as important to you as a big battery, you put that in.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.460]   Uh, but you know these wouldn't fit together tightly to be all janky and wobbly and feel
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:05.280]   like, you know, when I remember those number games where you had to slide the numbers around
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.080]   and get them in order to feel like that.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.080]   So is this a venture beat story or is this a Android authority story?
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.560]   Cause the long epic stories.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.560]   Oh, you're right.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.560]   It's a venture beat.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   Thank you.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.560]   Let's give the credit to venture beat.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.560]   I'm just like they did the reporting.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:23.600]   So yeah, this is I get bit by this all the time where we're a blog will come along and
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:29.680]   say and rehash the story and get all the all the credit and the links.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.680]   So let's do the venture beat story.
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:36.680]   Let's give credit to Harrison Weber who did a lot of good reporting on this.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:40.920]   So yay reporters, reporters, what we do without you.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.680]   You are the grist to our mill.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.680]   I don't know.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.520]   I think that, you know, I think this was a good idea when they, when they came up with
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.800]   it, right?
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:53.120]   Because phones were, were iterating quickly.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.320]   And so you buy a phone and then, you know, the next month, the new phone would come out
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.280]   and have twice as much memory and all of these features and hardware features.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.960]   That you didn't have.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.160]   And so I go back to what I said before.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.640]   I mean, the phones aren't iterating like they used to.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.040]   And so it takes away a lot of the need, I think, to have a phone like this where you
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.520]   can switch things out.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.680]   Granted, customization is, you know, maybe important, but I think a lot of the impetus
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.040]   for this was, you know, that just phones are changing.
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.160]   You want the latest Wi-Fi technology.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:25.440]   You could get the module and replace the one that you had with something better, like
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.240]   you said, a better camera or something like that.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:33.280]   I just don't think that, I think that the speed of the way things are iterating is slowed
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.640]   down to the point that there's just no need for, there wouldn't be a demand for it.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.640]   It's a good point.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:47.160]   And one of the problems that Motorola had with it is, well, it's a nice idea, Dennis
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.840]   Woodside, the CEO at the time, Motorola, it's a nice idea.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.520]   But real people don't want to assemble their own smartphone.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.120]   They just want to go to the store and get one.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.560]   Yeah, and I think he's probably right.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.360]   But we would have liked it, right?
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.640]   Yeah, this reminds me, like, when you said that, I was like, oh, that's exactly why
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.640]   I used to build my own PCs, because then you'd swap stuff out.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.640]   And then I were like, when people were, like, back in the day, those are NPCs, right?
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.440]   Why would you do that, man?
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.440]   What do you agree?
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.440]   That's weird.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.160]   What's a PC?
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.520]   I think they knew what PCs were.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.440]   I could be wrong.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:29.880]   Really, I guess what Motorola is doing with those snap-on backs for the Motorola Z is kind
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.880]   of that.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.840]   And those are neat.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.080]   Yeah, and they don't have the phone.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.080]   I don't either.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.880]   I actually have been really tempted because the Z play has a really good battery life.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.640]   And it'd be kind of fun to have those decks.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.240]   They've promised to do, like, one a month for a while.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.240]   Like, you know, there'll probably be a lot of them.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:55.520]   Anyway, Project Ara, another one, bites the dust.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.520]   That was not the song.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.480]   I don't know what you were singing.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.480]   I was just, I don't know what you were singing.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.600]   You want to talk about Waymo?
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.600]   Waymo, which is a better name.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:16.160]   I like the name because it Waymo better name for the Google self-driving car project.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.200]   Yes, which is now its own company.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.200]   In Alphabet.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:26.560]   And they're going to start test driving a minivan later this month.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.160]   That doesn't look at all, geeky.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:35.240]   Yeah, it's pretty ugly compared to the other one that just came out the Fairchild.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:38.120]   But the Fairchild is not real.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.120]   Fair day.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   That's a concept card.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.320]   Fair days in an imaginary card.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.600]   Did you see that one at all?
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.280]   You didn't do any car stuff to just do, see?
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:50.000]   I didn't, there's only so many miles I can walk in a day or two days.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   I don't know.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   I don't know.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.760]   I mean, they're not selling it yet, but they've done drive-offs.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.400]   What do you call that?
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.080]   They've driven it against other, even the Tesla.
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.960]   And they claim that it outperforms the Tesla.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.960]   They're claiming there's not a Tesla.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.960]   Highly controlled environment, of course.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.920]   But I mean, they did show off a real car.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.560]   And they have 64,000 orders at $5,000 a pop.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.920]   The thing is, as a Tesla owner, I think Stacey probably would agree with me.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.000]   The fundamental thing that Tesla did isn't that hard.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.880]   It's a golf cart with a shell on it, a big computer system.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:39.960]   Making 100,000 of them is hard in a reasonable price that's reliable, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:45.400]   So making one or two of these, electric motors are really simple.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.560]   You could pop them into all, I mean, there's so many customization shops you can pop.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.880]   They'll turn your old car electric.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.880]   Right.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:57.280]   But I think now that they've opened the gig, now that the Gigafactory is in production,
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.480]   Tesla's really going to have a lock on this just because they can make the batteries
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:02.480]   cheaper.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.880]   I mean, they've integrated the whole process.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:10.360]   Well, and they also want to sell it, don't they want to sell the batteries from the
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.320]   Gigafactory to other companies?
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.280]   Tesla's always been like, we'll share this.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.360]   Yeah, which is nice.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.920]   Anyway, we'll see the fair day future.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.040]   A number of people said, well, we'll believe it when we see it.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.040]   It's beautiful.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.040]   I don't know.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.040]   I mean, they showed off some pretty cool stuff.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.880]   I like the valet parking feature they showed, which I don't think is going to be available.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.320]   But you get out of your car and you say, go park yourself.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.320]   Excuse me.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.240]   And it just goes off and finds a parking space in the parking lot.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.600]   And they actually demoed it live demo.
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.880]   Tesla can do that too.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.320]   You can get out and Tesla go around the block and find a part of this.
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:53.520]   Well, in theory, you can't do it with stock software now, but they've shown that doing
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.520]   it.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.880]   Of course, the sum of the features, the reverse of that, isn't it?
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.680]   Some feature comes out of your garage and comes to you.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.840]   So they showed off both of those features in a live demo, which could have been rigged
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:04.840]   or whatever.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.840]   But I thought it was pretty cool.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.840]   Oh, that's true.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.840]   That means they have some pretty good software.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:14.200]   And the LiDAR that they have built in pops up out of the hood, basically.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:20.040]   But remember that when they try to do that self parking thing at CES, it failed.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:21.040]   Which one?
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.040]   Tesla or?
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.040]   Faraday Future.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:28.520]   Well, no, the demo that I saw at work, it did go in the spot that they wanted to, but
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.640]   that's because it found a better spot.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.760]   It was kind of interesting.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.560]   So I would recommend people to go watch it.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:40.160]   I thought they did a pretty good job in the demo of explaining some of the features.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:44.040]   I don't doubt that they're way off in terms of timeline with when they can actually produce
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:50.680]   a car that is on the market that can do this, but their test vehicles seem to work fairly
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.680]   well.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.680]   Because I thought the same thing.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:59.640]   Lots of poo poo-ing about the Faraday before they had this demo, but they seem to actually
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.640]   have proven a lot of the concepts that they've been talking about.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.080]   I only heard about this failed one.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.800]   And I guess subsequently they did it again or something.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.600]   Because this thing, as I remember, just stopped.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.160]   And that was that.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.720]   It might have on the first attempt.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.640]   I watched it after the fact.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.040]   Hang on, I got to take off my phone off the clock.
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:24.680]   No, I'm just a highly competitive Tesla owner.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.280]   I already bought my electric car.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.280]   Don't make another one.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.280]   Stop it.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.280]   Yeah, well, there's no doubt.
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.040]   I mean, I think Faraday is going to be hard pressed to catch up with Tesla.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.440]   And there need to be more.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.000]   And you're right, Stacey.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.640]   Elon's always said, "Let a thousand flowers bloom.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.640]   Let's...
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.640]   We'll show you how we did it."
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.640]   So when...
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.640]   I can't wait for my Model 3.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.440]   Did you order a Model 3?
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.440]   I did.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.040]   You luck out.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.360]   So who gets the Model 3?
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.720]   You or your husband?
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.160]   I'm going to take it because I injured my Tesla again.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.160]   That car is just too big for me.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160]   Yikes.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.160]   I am a small car person.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.160]   So.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.320]   Actually, the way this is going, it might be your daughter that gets it.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.320]   No, no.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.320]   It's going to be out in 2018.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:08.320]   It'll be out in 2018.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.480]   It'll be, "I'm going to get my car this year next."
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:12.480]   Okay.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.520]   Speaking of self-driving cars, we'll talk about Waymo first.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:20.120]   And now I'll mention the fact that Apple's Chris Latner, who is...
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.120]   I'm doing it now.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.120]   So I'll go ahead and finish.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.120]   Yes.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:29.400]   Who was a legend because he created LLVM when he was a grad student at the University of
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.400]   Illinois.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.600]   In 2000, was hired by Apple three years later, went on to create Swift and Clang.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.360]   And now, she was leaving Apple on Tuesday morning, Tuesday afternoon.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.360]   We got the press release.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:44.440]   He's going to Tesla's VP of autopilot software.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.440]   But he's not the only guy who left Apple.
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.000]   There's a footnote to this.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.800]   The guy who designed the MacBooks or helped design the MacBooks is also going to Tesla
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.320]   to work on hardware.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:57.240]   So Tesla continues to poach from Apple.
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:00.600]   Now, let's talk about Waymo.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:05.040]   So I think the big news here was that it's got its own suite of sensors and it's bought...
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.320]   It brought the cost of LiDAR down by 20%.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.320]   90%.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:10.320]   90%.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:12.320]   Wow.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.520]   That's a lot because you need to have LiDAR.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.720]   That's the laser thing that sits on top of the cars and is like, "Here's what the world
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.640]   around you looks like."
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.320]   The Tesla does not have LiDAR.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.680]   It has radar and ultra...
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.680]   What is it?
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.360]   Ultra sound or supersonic or something?
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:29.360]   Ultra sonic.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.040]   Ultra sonic and cameras.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.040]   And cameras.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.560]   But it does a good job with that.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.040]   LiDAR is even better though, right?
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.480]   LiDAR builds a 3D model of the world around the car.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.960]   I have no idea which is better.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   The Bell down...
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.080]   LiDAR is better but it's more expensive.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.640]   That's why this price thing is so important.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.040]   It was $75,000 on the original Google self-driving car.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.240]   It's now $7500.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.560]   That is a significant drop.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.520]   As you said, 90% drop.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.280]   And I think the big disruptions we're going to see happening in tech.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280]   I feel like...
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.480]   And I even saw this at CES.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:08.600]   A lot of the technology and things we want is invented.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.600]   The big challenge is going to be things like price.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:17.480]   So I saw a robotic arm there for $10,000 with computer vision.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.560]   And that is so disruptive because they're normally like 50,000 or more.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:25.280]   So this was just a typical manufacturing arm.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.360]   Cheap as anything.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.760]   I could build a manufacturing plant.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.480]   I don't know what I'd make.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.880]   Wow, that's amazing.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.800]   So these are the kind of things like...
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.560]   I feel like when we're looking for the next big thing in tech, we actually should probably
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.800]   be looking for the next big thing in economics.
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:40.800]   Right.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.800]   Which is way less exciting.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.800]   Right.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.800]   Exciting.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.800]   Who was it?
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.800]   Neil Stevenson said the future is here already.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.600]   It's just not evenly distributed.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.600]   Right.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.600]   Was that him?
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.600]   Somebody, not Neil Stevenson.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.600]   Somebody said that.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.600]   Somebody.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.600]   Sounds like it could be, though.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.600]   It looks like he would say...
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:55.600]   Heinlein?
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.600]   Was it Heinlein?
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.600]   No, that was the magic one.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.600]   That was...
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:03.080]   Let me just type the...
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.880]   Actually, I could probably ask a Google.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.720]   My money's on William Gibson, actually.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.720]   Who said the future is already here?
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.480]   It's just not evenly distributed.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.640]   See if she says I...
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.640]   According to Goodreads.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.880]   A quote by William Gibson.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.880]   The future.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.880]   Very good.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.240]   It's just not even.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.400]   And then who...
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:29.760]   Who said any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic?
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.760]   Heinlein.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.600]   Arthur C. Clark.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.600]   Ah!
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.600]   Oh!
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.600]   Same generation.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.600]   Dang it.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:37.840]   I'm not going to lie to you guys.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.120]   I would fail on your trivia team.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.920]   All right.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.920]   Don't you love Google?
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:43.920]   I do.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:48.120]   The fact that I can do that is amazing.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.320]   I will say, so that's where Google Home shines over the Echo.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.320]   That's right.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.040]   I saw that you were upset that there weren't enough things or on the show notes.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.760]   There's a thing about Google not having enough...
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.560]   Is it apps, participants, things that work with it?
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:06.200]   Well, remember, Echo is two years older.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.440]   I mean, Google Home came out on the Echo's second birthday.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.400]   Talked to me in two years.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.880]   Well, in like the...
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.720]   What was it called?
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.520]   The Echo.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:22.440]   It came out in December, that first initial version, December 2014, I think.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.280]   And it wasn't until March that you actually got a lot of the smart home capabilities.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.280]   Right.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.280]   Right.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.280]   So like...
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.280]   It takes time.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.280]   People have to add...
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:35.440]   You know, there were only four 500 skills in the first year of Echo.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.440]   And now there's 7,000.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.440]   I will say.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:44.120]   Talking to people who are working with both companies in the smart home space, the challenge...
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:50.040]   So what they say is the big difference is Amazon knows what it wants and how to...
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.680]   It knows how it wants things to work.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.880]   Google's still trying to figure that out, which makes it hard to actually implement some
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:58.160]   of these things for companies who are trying to work with it.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:04.040]   Yeah, you get the feeling Jeff Bezos has dialed in in a way that no one at Google has dialed
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.040]   in.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:09.680]   And the person at Google who says, "It used to be Larry and Sergey, I guess."
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.280]   And then it was Eric Schmidt.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:17.880]   I don't think Sundar Pichai is saying, "Is Google still responsible for Google Home?"
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:18.880]   Right?
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.880]   That's a Google company.
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:21.880]   I think isn't it Rick Osterlo?
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:22.880]   Because he's in charge of hardware.
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:24.880]   He's in charge of hardware.
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.880]   So I don't know who's in...
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.880]   No, that's not.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:28.880]   You need the visionary.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.120]   You need the Steve Jobs or the Jeff Bezos or the Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:32.360]   You need the one guy who says, "No, no.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.360]   This is a priority.
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.360]   This is what we're going to do."
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:35.360]   Or girl.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.360]   Or girl.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.400]   And you know what, Marissa Myers now available.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.220]   She is now...
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:49.240]   Once the deal closes for Yahoo, she'll be off the board as well as leaving his CEO.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:55.160]   What remains of Yahoo, the stake in Alibaba, will now be called Altaba.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.320]   Wait, what is...
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.320]   What?
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:00.920]   Where did that come from?
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:01.920]   They had another name too.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:03.920]   Let me see if I can find that.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:10.360]   That wasn't the only choice and another name that they were thinking about.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.200]   So it is only the investment group.
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.200]   It's not...
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:18.040]   It's just the Alibaba stake and the Yahoo, wherever...
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:22.280]   Yahoo, Japan and Alibaba.
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:24.680]   There was another name.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:25.680]   What was it?
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.200]   Before there was Altaba.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.720]   It was like, "Abba, Alibaba, Alibaba."
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.880]   Well, and maybe this means something in another language.
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.120]   Or doesn't mean something?
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.120]   I don't know.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:42.320]   Anyway, we don't have to mention it because there will be no news about Altaba that will
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.080]   be Jermaine's, I don't think.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.920]   So like I said, Marissa Myers available.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.720]   True.
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:54.320]   Dan Primak, who I adore and is the smartest person when it comes to private equity.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:58.240]   V.C. says that she'll be snapped up quickly by a V.C.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.240]   I think so.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:00.880]   You know, a good CEO.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.400]   Man, you need the visionary.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.080]   I'm telling you, I think you need the visionary.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:08.200]   Yeah, but you also need the...
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.720]   I was going to say the executioner.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:10.720]   Of course.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.720]   That doesn't actually fit the executioner as well.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.480]   That is actually what they do.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:15.480]   Exactly what they need.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:16.480]   You need the executionist.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.960]   In other words, you need someone that can execute on those plans and carry them out.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.720]   And I think that's where Google falls down.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.920]   They've got a lot of great ideas, right?
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.520]   But they don't follow them through.
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:28.120]   They don't figure out how to connect things together.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.320]   I don't think that that's...
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:35.040]   So when you say executionist, I think of a Tim Cook type, a COO, a guy who can make things
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.040]   happen.
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:41.520]   But to me, the executionist is a person who has enough vision to say, "This is what we're
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:45.040]   doing and this is how all of these pieces fit into it."
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:48.400]   And it's that second part of what you just said that Google falls down on.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.160]   They don't do it.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:54.000]   They throw a lot of spaghetti against the wall, but they never tie the strands together.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.840]   Or weave them together.
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.840]   As it were.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:02.840]   Oh, speaking of...
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:06.800]   Oh, I was going to say CEOs, did you see that John McFarland stepped down from...
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:07.800]   Sonos.
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:08.800]   Sonos.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:09.800]   What does that mean?
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.320]   He was one of the founders, founded it 14 or 15 years ago.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.320]   Really it's an unusual company.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.400]   They never took investment.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.400]   It was bootstrapped.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:20.360]   It's in Santa Barbara, not Silicon Valley.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.280]   They succeeded because they made a product people love.
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.800]   And actually the article I read about it said, "The real secret was you buy one and
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:32.240]   I know this was true for me and you like it so much you buy another every room ends
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.240]   up having it."
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:36.200]   So what happened with the echo too?
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:45.640]   So it sounds like reading the interviews, he had wanted to step down for a while.
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:49.600]   His wife was fighting breast cancer and whatnot.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.800]   He stayed on because of the challenge of the echo.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800]   But he admitted...
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.800]   I think it was in the New York Times actually.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:01.520]   He admitted that he didn't see the echo for what it was and the challenge it would be
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:02.920]   for its business.
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.880]   He just saw it as a crappy speaker.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.880]   And he was like, "Eh."
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.760]   And I think that realization is one of the reasons he's stepping down.
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.160]   He's like, "Oh, I don't got this anymore."
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.160]   That was my take too.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:19.680]   He doesn't have it anymore because he really is focused on his family and his wife.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.680]   Right.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:26.600]   And bully for him, they had a billion dollar year last year.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.600]   Wow.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:31.080]   I have six sonos in my house.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:32.400]   So yes, I like you Leo.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.400]   I'm like, "Oh."
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.080]   Echo and Sonos.
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:40.600]   But that's why you and I are both dying and supposed to happen this year.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:41.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:42.600]   I can't wait.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:43.600]   Then I'm done.
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.920]   My home has started enough.
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:46.920]   Then I'm done.
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.800]   No, if we're Google Home that did it, it didn't matter.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.800]   Whoever did it.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:55.480]   The be able to say, "Hey, play David Bowie on my living room Sonos.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:57.800]   I'm done."
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.120]   That is really the dream.
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.120]   Yep.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:04.760]   I would love it if I could say, "Listen to my audible book on my living room Sonos."
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.480]   And that's where Echo might have an advantage.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.120]   That would be really awesome too.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:12.160]   I really do that though with the Chromecast audio.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.880]   Now, granted, it doesn't work with Sonos.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:20.760]   But if you want that functionality, you could do it.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.760]   Could you plug in an extra host?
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.360]   No, you have to make it for Sonos anyway.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.680]   You have to make a back end.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:32.920]   I guess, how would Echo control Chromecast?
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.280]   Is there a Chromecast interface?
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.800]   No, I mean, with Google Home, you can do it.
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.040]   Or with Google Home, I could do it.
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.680]   Oh, yes, that was one of those things they sold of it, didn't they?
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:44.120]   Cast this to my living room TV.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.720]   You can say exactly what you just said.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:49.080]   It never quite worked though.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.680]   I have a problem with all of these casting things.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.680]   It works for me.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:57.520]   Like all the time, like you see the living room and you pick it and it just goes and it starts
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.920]   and everything works.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:35:59.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.480]   Do you have the new one?
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.240]   Because I think they improved some of the networking feature, like the Wi-Fi and radio
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.240]   stuff on the new one.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.240]   I think I have one too.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.240]   I don't know.
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:09.240]   I have to go and the old one.
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:12.240]   And it typically works just about every time.
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.600]   The old one's real iffy for me.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:19.480]   I'm with Leo and the old one is just kind of like my husband even liked it for a while.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:21.320]   And then he's like, you know what, don't buy me the upgrade.
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.320]   I don't want to.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.880]   It drives me crazy because I can see it.
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.960]   And the device can see it.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.960]   And I say cast to the living room TV and it goes okay.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.880]   And then it spins.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.280]   And then the TV goes like this.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.440]   And then the spin.
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.000]   And it just never ends.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.240]   It's like it's like.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.680]   I do get that occasionally.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:43.680]   Everyone said a while.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:45.920]   Well, we've talked before.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.280]   You haven't been here, but on this show, but I have the worst.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:50.760]   I have the worst, most Wi-Fi hostel environment.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:51.760]   I don't know why.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:54.160]   Are you still blasting it with the Orbeez?
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.200]   Yes, that works.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.880]   But you know what I ended up doing is disconnecting every other, you know, I mean, like I really
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.000]   narrowed it down just, you know, just this.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.360]   And it works.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:08.240]   And my mom, I gave my arrows to my mom and it's working perfectly.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:09.240]   She loves it.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.480]   It's a huge cause she couldn't.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:16.400]   She has a, you know, she mostly in the house, but she has a studio out back where she paints
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:21.440]   and weaves and she stopped going out there because she couldn't use her iPad out there.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.960]   So I put, you know, the Euro in the, on the router, the Euro in the front room, the Euro
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:30.560]   in the kitchen and then the Euro in the studio and then the Euro upstairs and it all works
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:34.120]   perfectly now smoothly and flawlessly.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.680]   It's, it's how it's, it's how I should, I don't understand what, but there's something
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:38.680]   about my house.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.960]   There's too much stuff in there, I think.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.320]   Too many, too many wireless devices.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.320]   RF interference.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.920]   It's, I have that in my mice.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.080]   I call it my server closet, but it's really now my hub closet.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.760]   So I feel you know, so jealous that you have a hub closet.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:56.200]   When you built the house, did you build the hub closet in Tetris?
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:58.680]   I built my house in 2012.
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:04.760]   So we put cat six cable through, we put ethernet, never room, no jacks, no telephone jacks.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.240]   And then I had a, I was hysterical.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.740]   That's hysterical.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:10.120]   You put no telephone jacks.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:14.560]   We have, and what's funny is there is an elevator shaft.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.080]   We didn't put the elevator in because we don't need it yet.
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:23.320]   But if we had, we would have had to put a telephone in the elevator to deal with like
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:27.360]   building code regulations because every elevator has to have a physical telephone.
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.560]   But AT&T actually doesn't want to install copper telephone jacks.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.320]   So it was like this big like, what are we going to do?
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.840]   Do you have an elevator now?
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.840]   No, I don't.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:38.840]   Just have a shaft.
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:39.840]   You got the shaft?
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:40.840]   I got the shaft.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:47.120]   One day, you know, one day when I break my foot again, I'm going to be like, dang it,
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.120]   now's the time.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.120]   Let's put in the elevator.
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.120]   But until then, my husband got, it sounds like a country song.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120]   It's very Austin.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.840]   My husband got the elevator and I got the shaft.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.840]   It's yours.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.840]   Take it.
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:01.840]   Run with it.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.840]   That should be your next show.
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:09.320]   Stacy gets the shaft.
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:12.640]   I just want a little shout out to Mike Masnick who we love.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.400]   He's been on our shows before.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:17.400]   He's the guy who blogs a tech dirt.
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.720]   And really, you know, Mike is an outspoken son of a gun.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:22.720]   And that's why we love him.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.320]   And he says, tells it like it is.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.760]   And he is now being sued.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:37.560]   There's a guy going around Shiva Ayadurai who claims he invented email in like 1978 or
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:44.600]   something, which of course is on the face of it kind of absurd because email has been
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:48.040]   around a lot longer.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.040]   This guy says, well, but maybe he, I don't know, maybe invented it independently.
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:53.120]   I don't know.
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:58.280]   But he's been, he's been going around and says he invented email when he was 14 years
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.320]   old working at a small medical college in New Jersey.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:05.880]   He created a messaging system for doctors, called it email and copyrighted it as such
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:08.680]   in 1978.
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:15.440]   Of course, there are many earlier ones and Mike, in fact, Ray Thomas and the guy who invented
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.440]   the ad sign invented that like 20 years earlier.
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:29.440]   Mike Masnick has called this guy a liar on tech dirt and so forth, 14 posts over two
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.600]   years.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:35.440]   So now Ayadurai is suing Mike and tech dirt for $15 million.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:42.880]   He's represented by the guy who shut down Gawker.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.760]   This makes me so angry.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:52.920]   And if some first amendment right company or even like the New York Times does not step
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:57.720]   up to help Mike, this strategy is the same thing that shut down Gawker and we can say
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.120]   what we'd like about it.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.040]   But this is going to shut people.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:05.720]   This is going to cause smaller publications to censor themselves.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:10.520]   You know the awesome if Peter Teal kind of gave Mike some money to defend himself.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.320]   Yeah, that's not going to happen.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.120]   No, I think it's not.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:17.720]   In fact, you know, who know, I mean, I don't know if Teal helped.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.720]   I think that's just a question.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:20.720]   Teal did.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.520]   No, Teal admitted that he helped Terry Baliyah.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:26.440]   I mean, that's Hulk Hogan's Sue Gawker using Charles Harder.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:31.160]   But there's no reason to assume that he's helping harder Sue Mike Masnick.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.960]   That's not the same thing.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:39.720]   He's got harder now has money because that case was won.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:44.800]   And also he's got a playbook now for going after media companies.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:50.240]   And you know, Mike, well, and to be fair, Mike, Mike Masnick wrote in November in a blog post,
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:53.560]   congratulations, Peter Teal about the settlement with Gawker.
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:58.080]   You've successfully censored true stories reported by the press.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.320]   And now it's now it's Mike's turn.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.240]   He says, Mike says, we're truly a small and independent media company.
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.560]   We do not have many resources.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:10.000]   We intend to fight this baseless suit because of the principles at stake.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.040]   But we have no illusions about the cost.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:17.120]   And I can tell you, you know, from my own experience, it's it cost could could easily
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:20.360]   exceed a million dollars.
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:23.480]   And if we win, it'll be distraction no matter what happens, it already has been, which may
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.400]   have been part of Iodirize intent.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.920]   It totally is.
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:29.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:31.800]   Yeah, that is a chilling effect.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:34.520]   You know, I didn't have any love for Gawker.
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:43.520]   And so I have to confess that I wasn't completely unhappy about the lawsuit.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.880]   But yeah, you got to defend First Amendment.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.800]   You got to defend the right for.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:53.560]   And Mike is a quintessential public interest reporter.
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:43:00.360]   He reports for the consumer against companies that have every interest in silencing him.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.360]   Yes.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.360]   Yes.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.600]   This is no, you know, Techter is no gossip blog.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:07.760]   This is a very, very important blog.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:11.680]   So Mike, if you're listening, whatever we can do to help, let me know.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:15.520]   And if you should decide to set up a legal defense fund, we'll be glad to not only.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.720]   I will send you money, Mike.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.600]   I'll tell people I'm sending you money.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:30.080]   Well, let's take a break and we can wrap this up with picks or tips or anything you're interested.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:31.840]   Man, we had a lot of picks from you, Stacey.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:34.640]   So if you wanted to take the week off, you could.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:37.040]   Oh, would you not want my picks?
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.880]   No, no, what?
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:39.880]   No.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.880]   Because I have some.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:41.880]   No, I want your picks.
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:46.360]   Oh, we didn't talk about the Washington Post story about the Best Buy Technician.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:47.360]   Okay.
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:50.040]   No, because this is highly relevant.
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:58.440]   If you are a technician and you see some child pornography on a hard drive and you report
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.920]   it to the FBI, well, that's one thing.
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:07.560]   If the FBI then starts to pay you, are you now working for the FBI?
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.360]   In which case, wouldn't you need a search warrant to look at the hard drive?
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.120]   That's the question at the heart of this story.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:20.200]   I feel like the question at the heart of the story is probably, can the FBI take evidence
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.920]   from paid informants?
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:26.440]   In this case, it's best buy, but imagine if they had paid informants at Amazon listening
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.560]   to your searches or paid informants working on the AI team at Nest that sees your camera.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.600]   Well, they always had paid informants.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.600]   Well, yes.
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:35.600]   That's not illegal.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:44.480]   However, at this point, they're in effect performing illegal searches on the FBI's behalf.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.480]   Right.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.280]   And that's where it's a problem.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:53.400]   It's one thing if you hire a guy who's mobbed up and say, wear a wire and we're going to
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:56.400]   give you $10,000 to wear that wire.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:57.400]   That's one thing.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.600]   I don't think that's illegal, but I'm not a lawyer.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.720]   Is that illegal?
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:02.200]   But this is different.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.240]   This is like a fishing expedition.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.240]   Look at every hard drive and see if you find anything illegal.
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.240]   If you do, we'll give you some money.
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:12.560]   But is that what's happening or are they just seeing something and reporting a crime?
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.560]   Well, that's the question.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.560]   I hate it.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.720]   At one point, where do you cross that line?
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.040]   And obviously, if you're getting paid, but the FBI, then you've crossed.
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:26.960]   It is completely legal for best by technicians to look at your hard drive because they're
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.360]   private company.
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:30.920]   You've authorized it.
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:34.440]   So that's not the law doesn't prohibit private searches.
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:40.360]   But as soon as a court could say, well, but because you're paying this guy, he is now
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.880]   working for you.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.560]   That's different than you need to warrant.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:50.040]   I think that's only I mean, like if you send your I don't have child pornography on my
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:52.520]   computer, but it.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:55.400]   Let's not do child pornography actually, because that's just reprehensible.
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:57.240]   Let's do something a little like.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:59.440]   Let's say you have torrents on your computer.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.320]   You've been downloading movies.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.840]   And so I've got my torrents.
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:05.120]   I'm sending them in.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.320]   I mean, that's something I would totally expect no one to mess with because it's a small
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320]   crime.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:18.040]   I mean, well, but if I do, I was consigning that over to someone who was paid by the US
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:24.200]   government, I would think very differently about it.
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.200]   It's an interesting thing.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:32.120]   I mean, if you're in the in your work, if you come across something so illegal like child
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:36.520]   pornography, I would think you'd have a duty to report it.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.520]   Don't you?
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.520]   Yes.
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:39.520]   I would.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.520]   I mean, I would report child pornography in a heartbeat.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:41.520]   Right.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.440]   I probably wouldn't report torrents.
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.920]   I probably wouldn't report.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:47.640]   That's your value judgment.
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:49.840]   But I don't think there's anything wrong.
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.360]   In fact, I think there's a duty.
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.280]   If you see something.
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:54.280]   Say something.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.280]   If you see something, say something.
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:00.600]   Isn't there, couldn't there be also the liability issue though?
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:03.160]   If you don't say something like in the case of torrents.
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.160]   Exactly.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:10.480]   So I would think that companies might have a policy that says, if you see this, and
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:13.360]   many of these lists of things, you are obligated to report it.
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:18.720]   Because if you don't, that company could be held liable in the future for not reporting
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.720]   that.
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:24.840]   So really it comes down to is there a relationship prior relationship between the FBI and the
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:25.840]   technician?
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:34.600]   And a judge is, by the way, in the case of an issue here, has agreed that the defense
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:38.200]   attorneys can bring that up and probe that relationship.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:41.000]   So a judge I think is saying, yeah, well, let's find out.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000]   There is some, perhaps there is something here.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.520]   The federal prosecutors argued in California that when a technician doing repairs, quote,
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:53.600]   "stumbles across images of child pornography," and the government wasn't aware of the search,
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:56.880]   the technician is clearly not performing the search with the intent of assisting law
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:57.960]   enforcement.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:02.560]   And therefore that is a legal search.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:03.560]   That's their position.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:06.360]   So intent and search got it.
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:07.360]   Any circumstance.
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:12.640]   Well, Best Buy Spokesman said on Monday, Best Buy and Geek Squad have no relationship
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.040]   with the FBI from time to time.
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.920]   Our repair agents discover material that may be child porn.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.760]   We have a legal and moral obligation to turn that material over to law enforcement.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:25.600]   We're proud of our policy and we share it with our customers before we begin any repair.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:28.800]   I think that's, that's Jermaine, right?
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.400]   They disclose that.
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.880]   Yes.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:36.480]   Any circumstances in which employee receive payment from the FBI is the result of extremely
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.920]   poor individual judges.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:40.440]   So they're saying, "Hey, that's the employees.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.440]   That's on the employee.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:42.880]   It's not something we tolerate."
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.960]   And it's certainly not part of our normal business behavior.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:49.000]   Court records did not detail how often or how much the technicians are paid other than
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.600]   $1, $500 payment to one supervisor.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:58.480]   But emails between Geek Squad technicians and FBI agents in Louisville indicate a long-running
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.480]   relationship.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:00.480]   So...
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.480]   See?
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:06.280]   And that, I mean, because if you're certain, I mean, you have access to my emails.
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:09.720]   You have, I mean, like, imagine they go to Google with something like that.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720]   It's being interesting.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.720]   Okay.
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:14.720]   Sorry.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:15.720]   I thought that was really an important story.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:16.720]   No, that's...
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:17.720]   It is.
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:18.720]   That's your prerogative.
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:19.720]   Ta-da.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:20.720]   It's her prerogative.
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.720]   Oh, oh.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:28.560]   But that does bring us to a break and more with our picks of the week coming up in just
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.560]   a bit.
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.560]   Okay.
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:32.720]   Unless you guys have something else.
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:33.720]   Last chance.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:34.720]   Nope.
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:35.720]   Nope.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:36.720]   I'm always...
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:40.080]   I'm always open to, especially on this show, for some reason.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.080]   I just...
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:47.120]   I always like to give you all a chance to bring up anything that I left out.
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:50.800]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:55.960]   I love Rocket Mortgage because I am a geek and I want to do everything online.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:58.360]   I don't know what it was like when you got your home loan stay.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:00.120]   So you had to get a construction loan.
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:01.120]   That's a...
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:02.120]   Oh, that's a nightmare.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.120]   Week.
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:04.120]   Or your refi.
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.000]   When we bought our house when Lisa and I bought our house almost, yeah, a little over three
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.760]   years ago, we thought, oh, you know, we've been through it before.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:15.120]   If it'll be a couple of weeks, we have a vacation coming up in a month.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:18.240]   It could possibly go that long.
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:25.160]   There we are on our cruise, faxing documents, getting Lisa's sister to find bank statements.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.240]   Nothing went on for six or seven weeks.
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.000]   That's crazy.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.040]   Rocket Mortgage takes the mortgage approval process into the 21st century.
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:33.040]   You know why?
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.520]   Because it's backed by quick and loans.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.320]   There's nobody better, the best mortgage lender in the country.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:44.600]   So when it's time to buy or time to refi, I want you to check out rocketmortgage@quickandloans.com/twig.
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:50.360]   Not only can you do the whole thing online, including submitting pay stubs and bank statements
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:54.440]   with a touch of a mouse or your finger because you can do it on your phone or your tablet
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:58.760]   right on the couch, but because it's all computerized, it'll turn around fast.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:04.320]   You can even have all these great calculators on the site where you can try different loans
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:05.320]   out.
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:07.080]   You can see what the payments are.
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:09.480]   It's totally informational, totally transparent.
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:12.880]   You know exactly what you're in for.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:16.760]   It's all about information, isn't it, for us in the geek community.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:21.000]   I want to do it online and I want it friction-free and I want information and you get it all
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.840]   from rocket mortgage.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:28.800]   And because you're doing it online, you can do it fast and get a response, get a loan in
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.800]   minutes.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.280]   That's tailored to your exact needs.
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:35.600]   Skip the bank, skip the waiting, go completely online.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.440]   Quickandloans.com/twig.
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:41.800]   Quickandloans.com/twig.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:47.560]   Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumeraccess.org number 30, 30.
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:54.120]   I know if I was selling a house and I had two equal buyers with offerings, equal amounts
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:57.960]   of money if one said, but I'm using rocket mortgage and the other one said, "Yeah, I
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:58.960]   got the bank down the street.
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:01.560]   I know who I'd pick."
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:02.400]   Pretty obvious.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.800]   Quickandloans.com/twig.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:05.800]   Rocket mortgage.
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:06.800]   Let's see.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:13.000]   Let's get Aaron Nukem's pick of the week to kick things off here.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000]   All right.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.560]   Could have unburied this thing.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.480]   Regular viewers of this week in Google will probably remember.
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:22.480]   I can't remember what episode it is.
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.160]   We'll have to get the chat room on that.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:30.520]   But I talked about a microcontroller probably a year and a half ago or so called Onion.
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:31.520]   And we did a little demo.
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:34.120]   I think I was in the studio for that one.
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.080]   And the LED lights.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.080]   Was that the radio?
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.080]   What was that?
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:41.160]   Now it's a little microcontroller called the Omega.
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:42.160]   Onion Omega.
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.800]   And I did a little demo of it as one of my picks.
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:50.480]   And as luck would have it, they've released a new version called the Onion Omega 2.
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:52.800]   And I happen to have it right here in my hot little hands.
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:55.000]   I got this ship to me a couple of days ago.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000]   So that's what it looks like.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.200]   You're just showing it very small little device.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:03.200]   And I think that people will be interested in checking this one out.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.200]   You know why?
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.840]   Because it's a Linux server.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:06.840]   Of course.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.840]   What?
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.840]   Yeah, it's a Linux server.
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.840]   It's a Linux server.
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:12.840]   $5.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:13.840]   So we talked about the $9.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:14.840]   Right?
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:18.400]   The $9 chip computer, which is this one.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.560]   And this is the-- let me get them side by side here.
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:27.520]   This is the $5 Onion Omega 2.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.520]   Quite similar, actually.
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:31.320]   They both have built-in Wi-Fi.
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:36.240]   The Onion Omega 2 doesn't really have display, so to speak.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:39.720]   But what they've done, which is really cool, is they've developed a lot of cloud-based
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:41.920]   and browser-based software.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:44.440]   So that when you hook this thing up, there it is right there.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:46.600]   You shot Flash By.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:50.360]   You actually get all the applications you need.
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:51.720]   You get a terminal.
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:54.840]   You get ways to control the GPIO.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:57.320]   You get all kinds of things right there in your browser.
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:03.360]   And you can just click on them and say, OK, make this GPIO pin a I-squared-C interface
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:06.360]   to talk to some other thing that I want to hook up to it, for example.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:08.360]   Can you get video at it?
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:10.840]   Sure, there's a way to get video out of it.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:14.560]   I've looked at the GPIO pins to see there's not really something built in.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:18.800]   There is an ethernet adapter you can get through the GPIO pins, physical ethernet.
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:19.960]   But there's not really a way.
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:21.120]   And that's not really what they're after.
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:25.480]   I think their biggest thing that they wanted to do with this device was to make it easy
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:29.480]   for makers to jump in and use it.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:33.280]   And video can be kind of a hassle if you don't have the right, you know, oh, I don't
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:35.720]   have HDMI, only a VGA or whatever.
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:36.720]   It can be kind of a hassle.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:38.800]   What they did was they created this interface.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:42.960]   In fact, they even have their own cloud service that allows you to control these things over
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:47.800]   the cloud just by logging in, registering your device, and then you can connect to it basically
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:51.440]   from anywhere and reboot it or change things, get access to it.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:54.760]   So they've made that part really, really easy for people to try.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:58.600]   It has this neat little dock, by the way, the original one did too.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:02.720]   It has this neat little dock if you want to get that, and then you just plug this right
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:09.720]   into there like that, and then you get access to a switch, a USB, and then you can start
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:10.720]   stacking.
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:14.520]   They have all these really cool modules that you can start stacking up kind of like an
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:17.640]   Arduino if you want to do other things.
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:18.640]   So I don't know.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:20.200]   I'd highly recommend people check it out.
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:22.840]   I think you can still buy it on their Indiegogo site.
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:23.840]   There's the stack right there.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.640]   Look at it, build it up.
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:28.920]   All sorts of things you can do with it.
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:35.600]   So it's yet another microcontroller.
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:36.600]   It's a real Linux box.
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:42.080]   I think it runs a version of OpenWRT, if I'm not mistaken, which is really cool.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:48.440]   OpenWRT runs on a lot of routers and access points and things like that, but it also runs
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:52.120]   a lot of applications, and it's a super slim version of Linux.
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:55.800]   It's still very powerful, but doesn't require a lot of space.
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:00.600]   The version that I have has 32 megs of storage built in, and that's enough to hold the OS
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.880]   and also enough room to do firmware updates and things like that over the air.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:06.360]   So really cool.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.040]   I'd highly recommend it.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:12.600]   I was really impressed with the first one when it came out, and the second one just adds
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:19.560]   power and space and an SD card if you want it for even more space and pretty cool little
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:20.560]   piece of technology.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:24.680]   So if you're into that kind of thing and you're making really small projects or something
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:28.320]   where you just need a little Linux server to run either inside or in the background or
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.680]   something like that, I highly recommend checking it out.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:31.680]   It's very, very cool.
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:34.120]   I wish I had time to do all this stuff.
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.320]   I would love to play with things like this.
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.320]   So cool.
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.320]   It really is.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:40.720]   It's really one amazing time we live in.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:41.720]   Wow.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:42.720]   Five bucks.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:43.720]   I don't even know how they do it.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:44.720]   Omega 2.
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:48.360]   It's the best fatty acid, and it's available at indiegogo.com.
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.200]   Yeah, I'm glad that's out.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.800]   We talked about it like way back.
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:54.760]   Did it launch in the summer?
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:55.760]   Maybe?
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:56.760]   Was it the summertime that it launched?
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.760]   Because we talked about it over the summer.
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:56:59.760]   On this show?
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:00.760]   Or on I/O?
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:04.400]   No, no, I had cast because it's like, why wouldn't you want that?
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.040]   A $5 Linux server?
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.000]   I think now it's got to the point where really what you should do is start with a project,
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.320]   start with something you want to accomplish, and then investigate because there are so
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:19.640]   many choices from the Raspberry Pi on down, investigate the best way to do it.
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:24.320]   I love seeing this proliferation of different ways of handling it.
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:27.240]   But I'm the guy who buys the thing and then tries to figure out what to do.
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:28.240]   That's a mistake.
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:31.880]   I do that too, but that's exactly what we tell people at the M were space.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:33.280]   They come in and they say, well, what do I do with it?
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:36.280]   I'm like, well, what do you want to do?
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:37.280]   What do you want to do?
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:41.960]   And then I'll tell you, and then also you're interested in actually making it happen.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:45.680]   If you're just like, I want to learn how to use a Raspberry Pi, well, okay, fine, you
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:46.680]   can do that.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:49.520]   But why don't you find a project and something you want to build?
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:53.440]   And then you can actually dig into exactly what you want to do with it, and it makes
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:54.960]   a big difference.
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:57.760]   They've got some examples on their website.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:01.600]   They have some examples of what they've done with it in terms of, you know, teaching,
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:02.600]   turning lights on and off.
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:06.640]   I mean, that's kind of the easy one, I guess, but they also have like, you know, streaming
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:12.400]   music or building robotics or, you know, creating digital art and things like that.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.440]   And once you start honing in on, oh, yeah, that looks cool.
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:17.320]   I want to do that.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:18.720]   Then the rest comes a lot easier.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:22.480]   Stacey, what do you, what do you have for us?
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:26.680]   Okay, guys, I have a buy this and don't buy that.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:28.120]   So oh, I love that.
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.280]   You should do that more often.
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:31.360]   This could be a whole regular thing.
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:32.360]   Buy this one.
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:33.600]   Don't buy that one.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:37.360]   So okay, guys, y'all are going to laugh at me.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.360]   I bought the cosmetics.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:40.360]   Wait a minute, don't tell me.
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:44.560]   Is that your wrestling belt that you won for being the champion?
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:45.560]   No.
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:46.560]   Okay.
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.400]   I have to back up so you can get the full visual here.
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:50.320]   All right, Lord, what are you?
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.320]   What?
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:52.320]   Ready?
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:54.320]   It's going to make a lot of noise.
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.440]   It is a see that giant glowing.
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:58.120]   It's a massager.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:58:59.840]   I saw this at CES.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:02.440]   And you have to have it.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:03.440]   Okay.
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.880]   This is the traumatic instant.
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:05.880]   Traumatic shot.
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:06.880]   There it is.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:08.840]   Plus neck and shoulder massager.
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:11.520]   Oh, it's only a hundred bucks.
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:13.000]   That's not bad.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:18.320]   So and you can like move it around your back and so totally buy this because it is like
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:19.320]   really great.
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.320]   See, it's like pushing me out.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:21.320]   That's how strong it is.
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:24.840]   And the fact that you because I had one of theirs where it was like, it's called the
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:25.840]   thumper.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.400]   And you had to like hold it.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:29.720]   My doctor was like, you're so tense all the time.
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:30.720]   You need this.
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:32.720]   So I was like, all right.
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:38.320]   You know what I do after I this is my little secret, but after every show on Wednesday,
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:41.240]   I go get a massage for my human.
[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:46.400]   So I get massages every two weeks from a human, but in the meantime, because my life
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.200]   is so stressful.
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.200]   Mommy.
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:51.800]   Mommy's wearing her special shawl now.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:53.600]   Don't bother me.
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:54.600]   It is amazing.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:55.600]   All right.
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:59.360]   So it does look a little bit weird, but okay.
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:03.280]   It totally looks like an alien is like with the because the there's a heating element.
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:04.280]   And that's what makes it glow.
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:05.280]   Oh, that's what that weird.
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:07.760]   Well, I thought that were LEDs in there.
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:10.120]   Yeah, they might be.
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:14.040]   So it you don't really need it to get warm, but why not?
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.640]   Let's let's do it.
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:16.640]   Yeah.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:18.960]   So I'm in love with this thing.
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:20.680]   So that's the T.R.U.
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:21.680]   M.E.D.I.C.
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:23.160]   It's $108 on Amazon.
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:27.960]   The traumatic Insta Shia Tzu plus neck and shoulder massager.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:28.960]   Yes.
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:29.960]   Yes.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.920]   The weight of your arms like keeps it on there.
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:32.920]   So you have to.
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:33.920]   Oh, that's why.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:34.920]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:35.920]   So you see this.
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:44.200]   Now I will say I it's some spots because I am a delicate female, perhaps.
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:46.200]   I don't know.
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:48.520]   It does hit my shoulder blades.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:51.600]   So there are a couple of my husband doesn't have this problem because he has more muscle,
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:54.440]   I think, over it his shoulder blades than I do.
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:01:03.680]   So if you are tinier or have not a lot of muscles, that may be an issue in certain spots, but
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:06.680]   it still has there's still places at work.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:07.680]   So there's that.
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:08.680]   Yeah.
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:09.680]   Here's what you don't buy.
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:10.680]   Do you fight over it?
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:11.880]   Do you like or do you have to?
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:12.880]   No, no, no.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:15.880]   It's my turn with the Insta Shia Tzu.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:18.480]   It's always my turn with the Insta Shia Tzu.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:25.400]   It does only run for 20 minutes before shutting down and they have to recharge it.
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:27.560]   Oh, no, you don't have to recharge.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:30.160]   No, that's to charge it.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:31.720]   It's actually is better.
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:33.640]   Yeah, because you want to walk around.
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:34.640]   Yeah.
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:36.680]   Don't go outside wearing it though.
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:38.480]   I know.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:42.080]   Okay, that's the Dubai.
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:43.080]   What's the Dubai?
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:45.080]   Don't buy this.
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:47.160]   This is it was so promising.
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:52.680]   It's the G E Z wave hinge pin open close sensor.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:57.400]   Oh, you I saw your Instagram or your picture of this at C.S.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:58.400]   Yes.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:01:59.400]   It was my nemesis.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:03.280]   So I tweeted about this because two weeks ago I saw this online and I was like, holy
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:05.680]   cow, it's like a hidden open close sensor.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:06.680]   I love this.
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:09.040]   I've been we've been I want this on my office door.
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:11.960]   When people come in my office, I want to be able to push a button and have the door closed
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:12.960]   behind them.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:17.160]   - Okay, this doesn't have a servo, so no.
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.360]   It wouldn't do that.
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:19.840]   - What does it do?
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:21.360]   - That's your project.
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:23.380]   So this is, this just tells you
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:24.360]   if the door is open and closed.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:25.200]   - Oh!
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:26.440]   - So then it can trigger things to have it.
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:29.320]   So I know, not as exciting.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.600]   - There are other things that do,
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:32.640]   I mean smart things makes a system that will do that.
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:33.780]   There's lots of companies are processing.
[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:34.620]   - Okay.
[02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:36.240]   The value here is that it's hidden.
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:38.320]   So it sits on a hinge pin--
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:39.160]   - Oh.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:41.460]   - And not that it's oh, fuck.
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:43.040]   - Why should you just go to the front side?
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:43.880]   - Why should you just go to the front side?
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:44.880]   - Let's buy this, this looks good.
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:45.800]   - No, don't buy it.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:47.640]   So it connected wonderfully to both
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:49.760]   smart things and to the Wink platform.
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:52.200]   So yay for the connectivity side of it.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.040]   The downside is it doesn't hang tightly in the hinge pin.
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:59.760]   So it's impossible to calibrate accurately.
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:01.960]   We spent 45 minutes trying to get it to calibrate
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:04.960]   and buy golly, it just moved.
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:06.480]   And then once it moved, it was like,
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.080]   now my opener shot, opener shot.
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.040]   - Oh, you don't know.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:10.960]   - Right.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.220]   - And it does, how much was it?
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:13.060]   How much is it or what is it?
[02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:14.560]   - It's only $40.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:15.400]   - 40,000.
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:18.820]   - I'm gonna refer to Amazon, but yes.
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:22.100]   - So if it were me, I would go down to the dollar store
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:24.060]   and get those little security things
[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:25.060]   you can put on your window.
[02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:26.060]   - Yeah.
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:27.460]   - And just hook that up to the door
[02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:28.620]   and then you can do all sorts of stuff with it.
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:29.580]   - That's not invisible.
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:30.420]   That's what it says.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:31.900]   - It's not invisible, but it could be.
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:34.100]   You could build that into a door frame.
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:35.780]   - You can build that into a door frame,
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:40.780]   but you are like six little of hackers more than I am.
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:43.320]   I'm willing to put some of it with software
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:45.320]   and maybe a little bit of wiring.
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:47.340]   But when we start talking about drilling
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:49.340]   into door frames with my dollar sensors,
[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:51.240]   then I'm like, "Pwst, yeah."
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:52.240]   - Yeah.
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:53.080]   - She just built this house.
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:54.080]   - Also my husband would never let me.
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:54.920]   - Yeah.
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:57.500]   - Now, what's your husband's name?
[02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:58.340]   - His name is Andrew.
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:01.140]   - Is Andrew into this or does he just look at you
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:05.040]   and just go and walk away?
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:06.100]   - He's into a few things.
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.320]   He loved the June oven.
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:08.880]   Oh my God, that man is like--
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:09.720]   - Really?
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:10.560]   - Yeah.
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:11.760]   - I love that thing so much.
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:12.880]   - They sent me a thing saying,
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:14.580]   "You've given us a deposit, we're ready to ship it,
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:18.280]   but we need the other $1,450."
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:19.600]   And I just haven't done it.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.600]   I think I'm just gonna not.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:23.800]   But your husband loves it.
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:25.200]   - He loves it.
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:27.960]   The price is the fact that we have two ovens already
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:30.400]   and the price is like, is so high.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:32.280]   - Doesn't stop him.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:33.120]   - It's hard.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:37.040]   He loves the Echo so much.
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:38.520]   - Okay, good.
[02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:40.880]   I hear from it anytime anything's broken.
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:43.840]   But yeah, for the most part, he's just a patient man.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:45.320]   - He just puts up with you.
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:46.160]   - He does.
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:47.360]   - That's so sweet.
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:48.440]   That's true.
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:50.000]   - I cook him dinner sometimes.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.200]   He's nice.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.320]   - He's a nice guy.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.400]   He's a lucky guy.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:56.560]   He gets it.
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:01.560]   I would love to have an automated home person in my house
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:04.840]   set this stuff up 'cause I sure am not doing it.
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:07.560]   - Oh, someone in your chat room just sent me
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.120]   the Lowe's Iris cladding.
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:11.640]   So this sensor actually works with Lowe's Iris.
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:13.280]   So I'm looking at it to see and make sure
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:14.480]   it's a different sense of it.
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:16.960]   - See, this goes right on the hinge, see?
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:20.280]   - Oh, I'm gonna check that out.
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:21.120]   - That's the way to go.
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:22.600]   - 'Cause I have an Iris sub.
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:23.440]   - Yeah.
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.000]   - It's Zigbee, baby.
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.840]   - Oh, Zigbee could work with other systems.
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:27.680]   Thank you.
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:28.920]   Thank you, nice person.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:29.760]   Who was that?
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:31.680]   - And it looks like it'd be very easy to install.
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:32.520]   I don't know, but again,
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:35.760]   you might have the same calibration issue, right?
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:40.320]   - So this is my job is to spend 45 minutes calibrating sensors
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:41.640]   and seeing if I can or not.
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:42.560]   So you don't have to.
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:43.560]   - Yeah.
[02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:46.000]   Yeah, and you can tell us buy or do not buy.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.360]   - So super fun.
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:49.920]   - Good job.
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:50.760]   Good job.
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:52.360]   My really quick, and I'll make it quick
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:53.920]   'cause it's not that interesting.
[02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:56.800]   I didn't realize as a Google Fi customer
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:59.040]   that there was a Easter egg on Google Fi,
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:02.760]   a world of thanks and it's gonna expire on January 16th.
[02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:04.520]   So you have only a few more days to do it.
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:09.000]   And it's your typical Google thing.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.200]   Four weeks, four wonderlands.
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:13.360]   You can have it snow on your head
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:17.720]   in a picture that you send people and all of that stuff.
[02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:20.520]   So, and it's kind of a cute,
[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:23.640]   you wander around and you click on things.
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:26.640]   Here I'll create a Street View snow globe.
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:31.640]   Okay, so let's do it of the old Twitch studio
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:35.600]   'cause I think that there's, I know there's Street View of that.
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:38.520]   And I'll do next.
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:41.320]   And it's gonna, I'm gonna, there's the studio.
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:44.240]   I'll pick the perfect angle, okay.
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:46.280]   Next and now it makes a snow globe.
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:52.280]   And I can have it either have a palm tree or let it snow.
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:54.200]   Let's do let it snow.
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:56.120]   And then I can share that and send it to people.
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:58.200]   It's now snowing.
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.560]   It's gonna be snowing.
[02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:01.160]   Oh, customize.
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.160]   No, yeah, let it snow, that's good.
[02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:05.360]   Okay, here we go.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:06.600]   And I can share this with friends.
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:10.360]   If you're a Google Fi customer, holiday.
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:14.000]   I'm sorry, Fi holiday.withgoogle.com.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.040]   And look, aw.
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.520]   Okay, I'm in, it's stupid.
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:20.280]   I know, it's dumb, but there's a whole bunch of other ones
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:25.280]   you can wander around ring bells, do things, play games.
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:28.240]   Oh, you can learn some languages too.
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:31.240]   What's the most respectful greeting in Thailand?
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:34.680]   Rolling your eyes clockwise, making a loud clicking sound,
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.800]   kissing cheeks three time or touching your palms
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:38.360]   and bowing.
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:39.200]   Go on with that one.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:41.040]   Yeah, touch your palms and bow.
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:42.600]   So you can learn a few things too.
[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:44.960]   This would be fun for your daughter.
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:47.960]   All right, everybody, we're out of time.
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:50.920]   We're out of recommendations.
[02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:53.600]   And we're out, most importantly, we're out of Stacey and Erin.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:54.440]   Thank you Erin.
[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:55.360]   Thank you Erin Nukem.
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:58.600]   Erin's a great guy, go to the Benisha Maker Space
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:01.240]   and build something if you're in the East Bay.
[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.840]   You could find him on Google Plus.
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:04.480]   He's the last guy there, Erin Nukem,
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.560]   or on Twitter, Erin Nukem.
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:09.120]   Don't confuse him with any other--
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:10.480]   I'm Erin Nukem everywhere.
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:13.480]   And don't forget, I've got the new book coming out
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.800]   in the spring, just put the finishing--
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:21.400]   And your Wi-Fi died right at the end there.
[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:23.720]   I was like, this is a table type connectivity problem.
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:26.480]   What is-- I remind me again, what is the book on?
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:28.160]   It's going to be-- it's Linux for makers.
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:29.880]   And it is about Linux for makers.
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:31.880]   That's got to be published by Maker Media.
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:34.240]   Look for it in bookstores everywhere.
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:37.400]   And we ought to interview you when it comes out.
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:38.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:39.160]   Absolutely.
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:41.560]   You can pre-order it now on Amazon.
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:44.280]   Linux for makers.
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:44.640]   Thank you.
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:45.480]   Erin.
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:47.200]   You bet.
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:49.480]   Stacey Iganbotham.
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:52.680]   She's running around the house, making it crazy.
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:54.440]   I hope you feel better.
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.320]   Oh, I will.
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:58.680]   The day quills going to start to wear off in about a minute.
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:01.280]   So we got to get Stacey off the air here.
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:02.160]   It's true.
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:02.920]   Stacey on IOT--
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.040]   I think the day will run out.
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:05.000]   No.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.320]   Stacey on IOT.com or IOTpodcast.com for the great podcast
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:12.600]   she does with Kevin Tofel.
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:14.880]   Give Kevin our regards.
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:17.960]   I hope we'll see you next Wednesday.
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:19.080]   I'll be here.

[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:26.360]   No, I said the wrong time.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:29.200]   That's why the numbers didn't all add up.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:30.640]   1 30 PM Pacific.
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.400]   You might want to make a note of that, Stacey.
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:36.120]   1 30 PM Pacific, 4 30 Eastern, 21 30 UTC.
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:37.760]   That's when we get together every Wednesday.
