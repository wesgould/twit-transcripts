[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Jeff is here. Stacey is here.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.240]   And is here. Here's some very good news. I've done the whole show and Jeff and I did not get in a
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.040]   battle. Not even when I suggested that Facebook can't fix itself. We'll also talk about Google's
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.280]   big search on live event coming up tomorrow and why nobody wants to cover that. The Gartner
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:33.200]   hype cycle, our Pixel 5 cameras. Not so hot. What's wrong with 5G and a whole lot more. It's a
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.800]   jam back show coming up next this week in Google. This week in Google comes to you from Twig's

[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Twig. That's a terrible name.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.360]   It's the first one it is. No, it's about us. It's about us. It's the recursive show.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.440]   So the Twig is really...
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.600]   Twig. Twig is all the way down. All the way down. That's Twig's. That's Jeff Jarvis. Wait a minute.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.960]   Wait a minute. I need my cue card. He is the Leonard Town Professor. And I spell that P-E-R-F,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.760]   by the way, Professor. Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.680]   of Journalism at the City University of New York. Pay attention to him, buzzmachine.com,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:47.200]   at Jeff Jarvis. And his middle name is Morl Panic. His color is pink. And you are very pink today.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.840]   You look like a nice, big cotton candy floss kind of thing. Got to get a camera. I got it or something.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.040]   Oh, don't worry about it. It's not... nobody's looking on TV. Although, I have to say, I watched
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.800]   that new show on Fox called Next. And you really... John Slattery looks... I feel like I'm watching
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:14.000]   the Jeff Jarvis show. It's really... It's really good. There's Ant Pruitt. Ant the man. Pruitt.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.440]   From Hands-off, Talkify Hands-On Wellness. It's good to see you. Thank you for giving me back,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.120]   my GoPro. Oh, man. Was that hard? It was a lot of fun. Yeah. I debated on holding it just a little
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.360]   longer. Just to ask for it anytime you need it. It's kind of the company. It'll be the company
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.400]   GoPro. A lot of fun. They told you what happened to my old GoPro 40 frames per second. I know.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.000]   My old GoPro, when I got the Tesla, they stuck it to the side of the car with a suction cup
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.080]   to get the video as you're driving down. It fell off and then a pickup truck behind me immediately
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.360]   drove over it and flattened it. And then Jerry told me, "I didn't know this." He said,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.120]   "I still have the pieces. You know, you could send it to them for trading value."
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.440]   Wow. I didn't know that. They take a... One of my favorite parts of your broadcast of the Apple
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.760]   thing was when you gasped, when you saw a phone stuck below a truck, going over rough terrain.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:20.960]   Oh my God. Yeah. They must have had 100 new iPhone 12s that they just gave to this filmmaker because
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:28.320]   they were dusting sand off. Yeah. I was like, "Oh my God. It's awful." But the video looked
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.840]   amazing. And it's worth it for Apple because it makes every putzer like me and go, "Oh, I can't
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.080]   wait till my video looks like that." And then we all weep into our beer when we realize, "Oh,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.960]   there's a little more to it than just having a phone." Just a little bit.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.720]   Oh, that's Stacey Hickenbach. I'm good to see you Stacey from the Great Pacific Northwest
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.160]   host of Stacey. Hello. IOT.com. Hello. Hello.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:03.680]   So, yeah. So, Apple did have an event yesterday. Did it make you say, "Oh, I'm not going to buy a
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.120]   Pixel 5. I'm going to get an iPhone." Well, the reviews about the Pixel 5 made me say,
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.640]   "I'm not going to buy a Pixel 5." You were saying that camera reviews are pretty negative.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.160]   Well, they just were negative. They were like, "Look, this phone, there's no room." What was end
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.200]   gadget had the most kind of, it covered everything. It was basically like, "This phone is fine." But
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.560]   the camera kind of doesn't compete with any of the others. So, why would you do this? It seems like
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.360]   Google's losing interest. Yeah, they said it's the first and the earlier cameras are just that
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.040]   they were disappointed they hadn't made your proof. No progress. No progress. Same sensor,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.440]   same background software. Yes, and gadget's sub-head was, "Yep, it's basically what we're expecting."
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.400]   And they matched my sense that Google just almost gave up. I don't think they give up,
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.440]   but I think that in a way, this is maybe what we wanted. Right, Jeff? We wanted them to go back
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.880]   to Nexus days, make it cheap, relatively inexpensive, pure Google phone. Didn't have to be the best
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.520]   thing in the world. It didn't have to be a flagship. This does not compete with the flagship phones.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.200]   What would you say the Android flagship is now? Samsung? Not necessarily the best Android.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:26.400]   I think OnePlus does a pretty good job with their version of Android. So, does Motorola, I think,
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.160]   is a pretty pure Android phone. That might be a better one to look at as a Motorola.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.560]   People like LG. I don't know how pure the Android is in LG. What do you use, Stacey?
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   I have the 3A, and I'm not upgrading. Yeah, there's no reason. Yeah.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.040]   The tiny iPhone 12 is a iPhone 12 mini. Yeah. That in the blue color.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.120]   My wife is so happy. She's been waiting for so long. I've been trying to get her to a phone for
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.120]   years. The phone she has is steam-powered and 20 years old now. She has a little iPhone, right?
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.640]   And she's just been insistent. I'm not getting a phone to the same size. I come on, saying,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.600]   "It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen." Of course, she's always right. And she's right.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.640]   So, she's finally going to order an iPhone mini 12 mini.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.000]   Okay. Now, I feel bad because I was very sexist. Stacey, you can punch me.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.200]   But I did kind of think, and I said it out loud, but I apologize immediately,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.000]   that maybe it was aimed at women who wanted a smaller phone. Perhaps I...
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.600]   I think, I mean, say, are there men? My husband is a man who wants the smaller phone.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.280]   Some guys want a smaller phone too. Yeah.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.320]   Look here. In general, we have smaller hands. Right, smaller hands and no pockets.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.000]   Or our pockets are small. I mean, you can stick any size phone in a purse, but you know.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.280]   Well, and that's what Rosemary Orchard said on Macbreak Weekly yesterday. She said, "Well,
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.280]   I don't have pockets, so I'm going to put them in my clutch, so it doesn't really matter. I'm going
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:58.240]   to get the biggest phone." Yeah. See, so really, it's kind of... What Kevin created this category of
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.800]   way back in the day of, "Are you a one-handed or a two-handed phone user?" Yeah.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.120]   And maybe that... I'm definitely a one-handed phone user. Right. So, yeah, see, I don't really care.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.480]   Ant, what do you think? Yeah, you got giant hands. You got... I have giant hands, but I
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.240]   had some apparent britches that I guess you can call them skinny jeans or whatever,
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:25.200]   that I wore just recently. And you know, I have the Pixel 4 XL, and trying to use those pockets
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.880]   was a bit of a pain in the butt with this large phone. So, maybe it's not necessarily for the
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.320]   ladies, but it's definitely a smaller phone for the smaller pockets. It's been seven years, Ant,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:44.000]   since the New York Times put out this quiz. How y'all use and you guys talk.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.120]   And I want you... Britches on it? Is britches on it? Britches on it?
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.240]   Possibly. I really want you to take this... I didn't realize I said britches.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.760]   You did. I love it. I love it. I'm not complaining. But in a way, I'm celebrating...
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   I think regalisms are fantastic. I was very shocked. I took this test the other day. Somehow,
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.480]   it's coming back up again and people are talking about it. I took this test the other day,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:18.160]   and it said, "You're from Providence, Boston, or Worcester." I left there in 1971, but they nailed it.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.600]   Lisa took it. She said, "You're from rural California, Stockton, Fresno."
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.840]   Nailed it. So, I want you to take this answer.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.280]   Where is it again? What's it called?
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:35.440]   It's just if you Google New York Times and how you guys talk, or I did dialect test and found it.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.800]   How would you address a group, Ant? Let me just do the first one, because this is the title.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.680]   It's only 25 questions. How would you address a group of two or more people? You all use,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.920]   you lot, you guys, youans, yins, you, other, or y'all.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.760]   See, I'd said, "You guys."
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.280]   No.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.720]   What would you say, Stacey?
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.560]   Y'all.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.120]   Y'all.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.240]   Oh, because you're from Texas.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.720]   Oh, she is.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.280]   I was like, "Really? You all never heard me say this?"
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:10.160]   What's interesting is standard English, standard American English, does not have a collective
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.280]   noun like y'all. Actually, James McWhorter talks about this in his books.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.840]   You all, so we don't have French has it. Most languages have it. We don't have a collective.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:30.720]   That's why you guys, or you guys, or y'all, I think y'all is pretty good, actually.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.160]   I'm a weirdo because I don't put the apostrophe in it.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.000]   It's just y'all.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.760]   Y'all.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.720]   No, you need the apostrophe.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.600]   Y'all.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.360]   I just have to say, take this test out and tell us where you come from.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.400]   Sure.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.520]   Because I bet you, I was shocked.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.960]   They would probably say Idaho.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.360]   That's where they say, "Britches," of course.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:00.240]   So I went to four elementary schools and three states and four high schools and three states.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   So I'm hoping that I can fuse it.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.920]   You might be, but I was stunned.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.080]   It says, "You're either from Providence, Boston, or Worcester."
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.560]   It's like, "What? How did you know?"
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.160]   It's like Henry Higgins or something.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.360]   Anyway, back to technology, where were we?
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.640]   The iPhone.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.040]   Sorry.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.720]   I have to say, and this one I'm going to defer to you, Stacey.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.400]   I am a...
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.920]   Wait, but I'm just finished with the quiz.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.640]   You can't ask me.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.560]   We got it.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.600]   We got a pause.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.160]   It's the law.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.280]   It takes a little while.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.480]   Go ahead, if you want.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.000]   I'll tell you what.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.520]   I'll set this up and then we'll go to you.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.560]   Because you...
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.080]   I'm on 24 or 25.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.600]   You're more of an expert on 5G.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.160]   You're a 5G.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.240]   I have been very skeptical about 5G, as saying, as many have heard.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.760]   I think it's a marketing term.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.400]   Some people say, "Well, it's like LTE. It took a while."
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:01.040]   But eventually, we all got some sort of high speed 4G LTE connection and really did live up to its hype.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.400]   I'm wondering if it's more like LTE or more like...
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:12.160]   Maybe you remember this YMAX, which was a highly hyped technology sprint jumped on it and turned
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.520]   out to be a complete flop. YMAX was going to transform rural internet.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.000]   It was going to bring high speed to everywhere.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.360]   I mean, it was...
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.240]   Those were the days.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.320]   It was a technical disaster.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.080]   I don't think 5G is a technical disaster.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.600]   I think the problem is there's three 5G's in the world.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.880]   There's what T-Mobile's been rolling out and Verizon just announced yesterday.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.720]   They're going to roll it out big time, too.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.480]   The low band 5G, which is roughly 600 megahertz,
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.200]   that goes through walls. It's like a regular cell phone signal.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.680]   It's good, but it's not anything special.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.320]   It's not the low latency and the high speed of what we think of as 5G.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.640]   Then on the other end of the scale, there's millimeter wave 5G, which only goes 800 feet.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.280]   So you have to put in four times more towers.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.320]   It bounces off of everything, including raindrops.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.920]   So the conditions really will vary with it.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.640]   It can be incredibly fast up to four gigabits,
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.200]   but that's really going to be limited.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.480]   In fact, most of the initial Verizon rollouts were inside of buildings for businesses.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.160]   They are now...
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.800]   Well, they also...
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.440]   Go ahead.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.800]   They were also for residential.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.600]   They're doing it so they don't have to play fiber.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.560]   And that's better than fiber, if it's 4G.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.040]   And I also would point out, because there's a lot of hype now,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:40.640]   nonstop advertising, I would point out that you'll always see ideal conditions.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.080]   Among other things, not merely ideal weather conditions and ideal distance from the cell tower,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.000]   it's also how many people are using it.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.320]   And at least for now, no one's using it.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.040]   Now that everybody's going to get started having 5G phones,
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.160]   you may find that those ideal conditions degrade very rapidly.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.120]   LTE was super fast as long as no one else was using that cell tower.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.480]   So it's going to depend a lot on how much provisioning they provide to each cell tower.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.880]   The reason this came up for me is the Apple event yesterday.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.640]   Here's a super cut from YouTube.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.240]   Somebody took all of the 5Js and edited them together.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.960]   Today, we're bringing 5G to iPhone.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.480]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.520]   5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.680]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.680]   That's variety of C, I'll see you.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.400]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.300]   5G also wide now.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.100]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.800]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.500]   6G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.640]   pass out the volume.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   I found 12 with 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 4G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.000]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.540]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:15:05.240]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.740]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.200]   Stay safe and have a great day.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.920]   So there were a few 5G's.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   You should find me one more time.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.120]   That's hilarious.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   That's just great.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.560]   It was bugging the hell out of me.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.360]   By the way, it was a while.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   You had to do that.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.300]   I should give them, and I just closed it, but it was a YouTube--
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.780]   let me see if I can quickly get the history and reopen it.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.940]   You're right, because that's a lot of work.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.660]   And I actually--
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.220]   What was that?
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.620]   I asked-- I said on the show, somebody's
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.500]   got to do a YouTube supercut of 5G,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.980]   and it didn't take too long.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.380]   So thank you, whoever did that.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.660]   Let me give you credit.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.900]   I'll go to his page.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.740]   The truth about 5G, and it is uploaded-- no, that's not it.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.540]   No, that's not it.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.760]   That's not the supercut.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.120]   Oh, no.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:51.620]   What's the matter?
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.540]   Where do you come from, Stacey?
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.560]   Oh, no.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.420]   I was like, you did such a great job vamping
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.360]   that I finished the quiz and now bored.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:15:59.920]   Mine is wrong.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.920]   It's wrong.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.520]   It's wrong.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.960]   So wrong.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   Mine is as I came from.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.760]   Irving, which-- OK, that's at least a text with the other two--
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.880]   But the other two cities that are most like me are in Arizona.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.040]   Tempe and Chandler.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.740]   Not here, you know, a southern girl.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.180]   So I am Irving--
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.180]   Irving, Texas.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.020]   --back in Rouge, at Brownsville.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.020]   I've been in Texas like twice in my life.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.020]   Oh, they've really got you.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.140]   We're a Texan.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.540]   We have such a way.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.380]   I think part of it is, if you say the words,
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.180]   there's a couple of--
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.140]   There's some giveaways.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.140]   I said bubbler, and that's a giveaway for a water fountain.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.060]   That's a dead giveaway you had to come from.
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.620]   Well, I didn't get a question about water fountain.
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.540]   No, they're not all the same.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.100]   No, it was in there.
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.940]   They rotate.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.940]   No, no, no.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.500]   They're 25 questions, but they rotate.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.300]   There's different ones.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.220]   Oh, I did not get that.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.220]   I did get that.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.900]   What do you call it?
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.180]   A water fountain.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.640]   It's a water fountain.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.540]   It's water fountain.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.460]   But when it's raining and the sun is shining,
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.020]   that's one of their--
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.740]   Yeah, I have no word for that.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.340]   What is the word for that?
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.220]   Well, sure as a devil beaten his wife, that was offensive.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.720]   So that's what my dad calls it.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.940]   You're kidding.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.440]   No.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:11.940]   No, really?
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.500]   But we call it a sun shower.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.700]   But my dad, for a long time, I was like, what the--
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.180]   Def waiting his wife, Gann.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.140]   That's when it was raining, but the sun comes out.
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.620]   They were used to run.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.660]   When that would happen, my family would say,
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.020]   OK, the devil is beating his wife.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.700]   And you know, because if you go outside and run around
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.180]   the house three times, put your ear down to the ground,
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.500]   you'll hear it.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.940]   Not making this up.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.860]   I was-- that's-- my dad would tell you the same thing, Ann.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.780]   Wow.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.820]   Wow.
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.620]   I never heard of that at all.
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.460]   So this is a cultural moment for me.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.180]   By the way, Leven Hare, L-A-V-I-N-H-E-R-R,
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.500]   did the supercut.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.100]   And the comment that he leaves is 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.500]   5G, 5G.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.180]   That's a description, yeah.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.060]   So thank you, Leven.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.540]   I appreciate it.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.040]   11.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.620]   Good work.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.420]   Good work.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.420]   Get a life, Leven.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.420]   Good work.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.940]   55 seconds out of the one hour event devoted to the word 5G.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.540]   And a lot of Verizon 5G.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.220]   I really felt like a Verizon ad.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:31.380]   It feels a little bit marketing to me.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.380]   But Stacy--
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.540]   A little bit?
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.500]   OK.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.300]   I mean, is it-- maybe I'm just--
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.460]   what did Jeff say in response to that?
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.340]   Like, what did you say, Jeff?
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:50.860]   You said you made fun of me for not buying into the 5G hype.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.100]   Oh, that was--
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.180]   it was-- who needs a color television?
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.100]   It's what you said.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.220]   Who needs a color television?
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:57.980]   Who needs a color television?
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.100]   Black and white is just fun.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:18:59.580]   And by the way--
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.740]   I can tell Lucy's Lucy.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.940]   My dad said that for my whole childhood.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.140]   You can still see it.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.780]   The more than I said, I have to confess that even as a young
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.140]   fart, I said HDTV.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.260]   I don't think it's going to take off too expensive.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.140]   But let us be clear.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.500]   There are technologies that really don't work.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.300]   3D TVs.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.460]   Can you buy one anymore?
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.580]   No.
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.740]   I'm wondering if VR is really just a hype and not going to launch.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.420]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.260]   I've been a sacrifice by number this week.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.180]   But I think it's relevant right now.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.820]   Somebody said in the video that he was stuck inside for the pandemic,
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.660]   it doesn't even better do.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.420]   We analyzed 25 years of Gartner hype cycle.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.180]   Oh, interesting.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.580]   And he just saw that something to stay on forever,
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.500]   something to get on, or when your wonders,
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.180]   and they come and go.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.100]   A lot of them.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.020]   I was like a third of them, no more.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:02.380]   And so 5G is--
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.460]   well, what was the last one that really mattered?
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.300]   Was it 3G versus LTE?
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.540]   What was 4G?
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.860]   OK, just step.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.860]   Just step.
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.860]   No, not the last one that we did.
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.060]   The last one that mattered.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.060]   LTE mattered a lot.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.220]   4G LTE mattered.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.060]   And I'll tell you why, Amanda.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.180]   No, you don't.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.180]   Stacey can do it.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.860]   But I mean, it isn't just high speed.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.220]   It also-- we used to be-- remember the GSM versus CDMA?
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.780]   And they finally could abandon that and do voiceover LTE.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.140]   And it completely unified the nation's network.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.620]   So that was a huge transformation.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.620]   That was a big one.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.260]   5G just bigger, faster.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.100]   Nope, it's a big deal.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.420]   Nope, I'm going to tell you why.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.420]   OK, thank you.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.820]   I knew you would.
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:49.780]   So on the consumer side, honestly, I don't think we should--
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.940]   5G will help.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.580]   But there's not a compelling reason
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.780]   to move to 5G just yet on the consumer side,
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.140]   unless you happen to live in one of the areas where you could
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.260]   doubt-- where you have access to it.
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.860]   If you live on race street--
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.860]   On 11th Street.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.180]   On 11th in Philadelphia.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:10.140]   I would say you should absolutely get a millimeter wave 5G phone.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.540]   It'll be amazing.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.820]   But I do think for industry, it's important
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.940]   because it will bring wireless into factory floors
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.700]   in a way that have never been available to us.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.500]   And that, once you eliminate wires in places,
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.180]   you can actually make them more reconfigurable,
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.740]   which means we can do cool things with production lights.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.140]   OK, but forgive me.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.060]   Doesn't Wi-Fi already do that?
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:44.700]   Wi-Fi is terrible inside factories for a couple of reasons.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.660]   One, everybody in the business world
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.660]   like Cellular because it has security guarantees for it.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.060]   Yeah, that's another thing Apple said.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.060]   It's more secure.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.740]   Wi-Fi is secure.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.860]   It basically is more secure than that stupid Wi-Fi access
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.580]   point at the coffee shop.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.780]   Well, of course.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.460]   Well, every new standard, they improve things.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:09.100]   Like, you can add new security encryption plans
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.340]   and whatever to protocols, not plans, to a new GSMA standard.
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.980]   OK, but I am going to point out--
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.460]   RegiPPC.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:22.860]   --that they will still use the easily hackable cell phone
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.420]   radios in these phones, which, I mean, everybody
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.820]   knows how to hack.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.220]   What is it?
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.820]   The 7SS.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.660]   It's not-- and they never have fixed it,
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.500]   and they never will fix it.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.860]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.580]   It's a problem.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.420]   Which rate are you talking about?
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   I have to look it up now.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.540]   It's been a long time.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.180]   So I have like-- like, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.940]   I think, I mean, from the most part,
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.220]   like, are you talking about hacking a sim?
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:50.780]   No.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.220]   Or talking about the baseband or the--
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.220]   The baseband.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.940]   I'm talking about hacking baseband.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.020]   And it is well known.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.140]   And the problem is nobody's fixing it.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.980]   So a smartphone is not going to be secure.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.300]   A millimeter wave access point, you could say probably,
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.060]   is more secure.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.020]   Sure.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.540]   But baseband zero days have been around forever,
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:23.660]   and they don't want to fix it because everything relies on it.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.980]   They can't, basically.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.820]   And it's this--
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.620]   I want to say, oh, who did we lose?
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.380]   Anybody?
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.660]   Ants frozen.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.260]   Yeah, it's internet's going up and down.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.260]   Anyway, so there is-- a cell phone itself
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.740]   is probably not super secure.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.740]   That's one of the reasons simjacking happens.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.020]   I mean--
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.940]   Well, so there's a couple things.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.180]   OK, so I'm looking at your baseband processor hacks.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.220]   Most of those stories are for 10 years--
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.540]   Yeah, but they were never fixed.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.940]   But those were never fixed.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.220]   Those baseband processors, the ones
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:58.020]   we were using in 2011 are no longer in use one.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.220]   But I see a zero day from 2017.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.620]   I haven't read any of this, so I can't speak to that.
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.660]   But what we're not-- we're not talking
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.740]   about the baseband processors or the processors.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.620]   We're just talking about the ability
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.540]   to get into the cell phone network.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.780]   It's much easier to get inside a Wi-Fi network that then
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.860]   has all of your corporate secrets or whatnot.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.700]   But if you attach something to a cellular network,
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.500]   you have to hack into the cellular network
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.220]   to get to that device is the theory that the people buying
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.420]   cellular connections are working from.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.740]   They're also way easier to get a device online
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.940]   and keep it online and less trouble for stuff in the field.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.100]   Wi-Fi is not great for that.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.980]   And depending on the way you've set up your network,
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.900]   it's also a little bit more reliable compared to Wi-Fi.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.980]   Now, Wi-Fi is getting--
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.900]   and there's some really cool technology that none of y'all
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.700]   probably care about, but it's called time sensitive networking.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.500]   And it is going to help make Wi-Fi way more reliable
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.580]   in terms of packet management that cellular carriers can
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.620]   already offer.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.140]   But the point is 5G.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.220]   Is it a big deal?
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.020]   The answer is 100% yes.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.500]   But what you were saying about the reading
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.060]   like five different kinds or three different kinds of 5G
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.100]   is totally accurate.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.740]   And I think when you talk about 5G,
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.740]   you have to explain what kind you're talking about.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.940]   And that depends on where it is in the spectrum.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.940]   So--
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.660]   And that's a bit of a problem because people are just promoting
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.420]   5G.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.900]   And when it comes down to it, it's really more complicated
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.740]   than that.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.220]   And Stacy, you are differentiating between a consumer view
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.540]   and a corporate view of 5G.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.660]   Yes, I am.
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.620]   So a big deal corporate, how big a deal consumer?
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.060]   Eventually, it will be a big deal in consumer.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.500]   And I say this because if we had stopped innovating and moving
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.820]   down the process node for semiconductors,
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.660]   or if we had said, you know what?
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.460]   Having internet connections that are, you know,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.580]   like a bit-- oh, not a gig a bit.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.220]   You know, 10 megabits per second, that's plenty.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.300]   You have to keep moving here because we're
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.420]   going to get new applications.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.860]   And I don't really know the killer--
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.500]   I don't think there's going to be one,
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.100]   but I don't know what that's going to be for 5G.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.220]   We were lucky when LTE came around,
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.860]   we actually knew what the killer app was.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.100]   And that was the iPhone.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.500]   And we were all like--
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.380]   because we were on these 3G networks with these smartphones.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.020]   And we were like, damn it.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.580]   I need more connectivity.
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.980]   For 5G, we're going to find something,
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.580]   probably several some things.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.380]   And we don't know what that is on the consumer side yet,
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.380]   but you can't just sit and be like, we're good.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.220]   This is good technology.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.140]   No, I understand.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.260]   But I think it's also our duty, my duty anyway,
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.220]   to say some-- not all technologies are good.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.820]   And not all technologies work.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.780]   And I-- you would say that a lot lately.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.060]   Well, I sniffed ice.
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.060]   I'm going to--
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.060]   a little BS in all of this.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.420]   It is worse.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:56.340]   So no, what you sniff is there isn't a super compelling reason
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.860]   for anyone to give up a lot of money
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.700]   to pay for the radios and their devices yet,
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.060]   or take the battery hit.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.060]   And even the carriers who are upgrading to 5G
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.220]   are kind of like--
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.060]   they're a little desperate because this
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:16.020]   is the first upgrade we're going to see on the carrier side
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:20.620]   that they don't have a super large demand for.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.740]   And it's complicated as heck.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.660]   My phone.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.900]   So my phone, you're saying is the biggest differentiator
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.380]   on my phone will be that it's fast--
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.820]   is that the bandwidth is better?
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.060]   It's faster bandwidth?
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.740]   Lower latency faster bandwidth on your phone, yes.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.740]   And so we're going to need some new applications
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.780]   to take advantage of that.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.940]   Like Chris Rock said in the ad, oh,
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.700]   now I can download an Apple in a second,
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.780]   an album in a second.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.900]   But he also said it used to take longer to download that album
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.340]   than the length of the album.
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.100]   That was a long time ago.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.420]   It hasn't been the thing quite a while.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.460]   It was not as terrible.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:59.940]   Horizon is actually putting 5G for in-home broadband.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.940]   They're offering 5G for in-home--
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.660]   I don't trust Verizon as far as I can spit.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.260]   So that's probably the number one.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.380]   In fact, none of the carriers I trust.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:13.580]   Other operators are doing the same thing.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.380]   And so it may be that for areas and not super rural areas,
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.700]   because you still need backhaul to the internet.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.860]   And I don't see it in one--
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.420]   They're not going to put it in.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.180]   This will be best as with almost everything else
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.300]   in highly dense cities, except millimeter wave
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.940]   doesn't work well in highly dense cities.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.740]   It works well.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.580]   What happens is the infrastructure looks like webcasts.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:41.940]   So you're going to have a tower that will beam to a satellite
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.580]   dish or something-- it's not a satellite dish.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.980]   But think of it as a satellite dish on the outside
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:45.820]   of the building.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.180]   And then that's going to be converted to a Wi-Fi signal
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.300]   in the building or to a local land.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.380]   But that's great.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.380]   Well, that's fine.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.580]   It's not going to matter with my phone, but that's fine.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.300]   That's nice.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.180]   That doesn't matter.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.300]   The point is connectivity.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.780]   Eventually, we're going to stop thinking about connectivity
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.940]   as wired or wireless.
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.540]   And we're also going to stop thinking about it eventually
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.220]   as cellular or unlicensed.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.900]   The cellular guys don't want that to happen,
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.140]   but that is going to happen.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.180]   So what's going to happen is we're
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.220]   going to be walking around with ubiquitous connectivity.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.980]   And we're going to have devices who
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.340]   are capable of tapping into not all devices,
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.620]   but are smart devices with batteries, like bigger batteries,
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.340]   are going to be able to select from the most economical
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.820]   or the most useful for the workload we're doing.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.540]   And that's going to be awesome.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.340]   It's just so distant and so speculative.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.700]   And yet-- It's here today.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.740]   Well, but wait a minute.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.500]   It's not because you're buying-- OK,
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.660]   so you're spending $100 more for an iPhone.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.300]   This, by the way, the iPhone does not
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.460]   have a fingerprint reader, which is something we could use
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.140]   today.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.300]   Because guess why?
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.780]   This place where you would put that fingerprint reader,
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.060]   that's the window for millimeter wave.
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:01.940]   So you're putting a technology in this phone that is--
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.180]   every phone is a decision between technologies
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.740]   that maybe someday will be useful in this phone
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.700]   or some guy in Philly can use it on Race Street in 12th,
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.700]   but is not going to be widely useful.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.100]   It's going to cost $100 more.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.700]   I really have to question the wisdom of doing that.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.180]   I just-- I guess if you're buying a phone for future proofing
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.700]   in three years or maybe five years,
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.820]   you'll be glad you have an iPhone.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.820]   Phones are the only form factor that
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.940]   will help that are wide enough and people adopt.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.460]   And they may ignore that $100 pricing
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:40.340]   to get this sort of technology to the economies of scale
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.180]   we need to put it in other places.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.500]   I'm going to predict Apple--
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.900]   now, it's hard to say because Apple's very good at marketing.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.140]   But I'm going to predict this is a phone that a lot of people
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.980]   go, yeah, I don't need it.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.260]   Because Apple has pushed it so much that it's a 5G phone.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.540]   And people are just going to say, OK, that's fine.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:56.980]   I'll wait.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.500]   Next year, maybe I'll get one next year.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.020]   Especially--
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.900]   You lost you at all after Mr. Ant?
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:03.660]   Sorry.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:04.060]   Sorry.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.180]   I was saying, especially now with people not making this much
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.140]   money, they're rethinking these purchases and saying,
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:09.540]   you know what?
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:13.420]   I can still make my Zoom calls and things like that
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.020]   with this existing tech.
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.380]   There's no need to spend an extra $1,000 for a spectrum
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.380]   that I'm never going to see for quite a while anyway.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.340]   So it just makes sense to hold on to what you got.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.780]   And this also made me think about, from a marketing standpoint,
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.220]   it just seems to be the way a lot of these companies
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.660]   would do on this bit of a marketing fallacy, if you will.
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.860]   It reminds me of Canon with the R5.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.100]   And it was being marketed as the super duper video camera.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.220]   Yes, it shoots 8K video, but it's not necessarily
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.300]   designed to shoot 8K video.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:51.660]   It's designed to be more of a hybrid and a photography camera.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.820]   But they were just pushing 8K, 8K, 8K, and everything.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.740]   And of course, it came back and bit them in the butt
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.780]   with all of their overheating issues.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.300]   And now, I look at this and watched our live coverage yesterday.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.020]   And I had to just step away because it was frustrating me
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.940]   because I know this 5G is not going to be around here
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.820]   anytime soon.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.780]   It's going to be worth a day.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.060]   Let me ask this.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.700]   Should somebody buy a 4A or a 4A 5G?
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.300]   4A.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.620]   Probably a 4A.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.140]   4A.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.420]   Unless they know they have 5G capability.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.860]   Right.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.420]   Well, my map says I've got 5G out here.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.580]   I just checked mine.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.780]   I've got two mags up.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.220]   Smoking.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.740]   So what would 5G then be better?
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:48.260]   Is it maybe a better installation or it's the same tower?
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.820]   Well, the tower is not--
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:56.420]   so what the 5G is, it's a processing protocol.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:02.220]   So it's the way the data is crammed into the airwaves.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.740]   So your tower will be able to handle both
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.140]   because it will have receivers for both.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.300]   So they don't mix.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.380]   But clearly, I'm too far away from the tower for my LTE.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.580]   Will 5G be any different?
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.580]   Oh, that's a question.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.580]   Who's your carrier?
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.420]   Are you ATT?
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.380]   So who's your--
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.900]   In their former headquarters tower, I might add.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.980]   So their 5G is an actual 5G?
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:30.980]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.300]   Your tower is that too.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.220]   ATT's 5G.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.660]   Then you use the--
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.900]   which is really 4G.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.540]   Right.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.660]   So yeah, don't worry about that.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.740]   I'm not going to say.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.580]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.540]   I'm going to ask you later, but I've
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.580]   got to go ahead and buy the Chromebook.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.300]   So I'm going to get your advice in a few minutes.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.100]   Oh, did you see the $300 deal on the Pixelbook Go?
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.860]   $200, $200, right?
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.220]   But it was the i7 one, which I don't really need.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.900]   I mean, even i Chromebook fan, I don't need--
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.860]   Give us $200, dude.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:07.460]   But it stole $200 more than the i5.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.900]   But was this a prime day deal I think it was, right?
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.740]   It's still on right now.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.660]   It's $1399 down to $1199.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.980]   Oh, it's $200 off.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.980]   I thought it was at $200 off.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.340]   Oh, it was $4, $200.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.780]   Oh, no, no, no, no, you're right.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.460]   No, that's not.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.460]   That's the question, just to turn it aside, got you.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.620]   Well, and I wanted to hear your views on the show.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.020]   I'll come back to the Chromebook.
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:37.980]   But were you lusting at all after the iPhone 12 Pro?
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:38.980]   At first, no.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.500]   And I'm sorry about my video acting weird again.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.180]   Skype doesn't like me today.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.060]   But at first, I wasn't lusting over.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.980]   But when they said HDR intended for video,
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.420]   that's pretty strong.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.820]   Oh, the camera's great.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.340]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.860]   And again, but we're still talking about a tiny sensor.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.300]   So there's a lot of different variables
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.900]   that you have to consider with these tiny sensors,
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.500]   as far as how much light you're going to need around there.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.540]   Well, that's one thing that is interesting on the Pro anyway.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.220]   And Apple did not do a great job
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.020]   of distinguishing the iPhone 12 from the 12 Pro.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.700]   But the Pro anyway, the sensor is now bigger.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.540]   It's 1.7 microns per pixel, which is a fairly big pixel.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.140]   That means a lot of light gathering.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.980]   And the wide angle is F1.6, again, really nice aperture.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.660]   That means a lot of light gathering.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.060]   In addition to all the computational stuff
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.340]   they're doing for a little while.
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.060]   I think that's what's going to be the killer feature
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.260]   is the fact that it's computational to help correct
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.820]   a lot of things that it physically cannot.
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.180]   Because some people are going to assume
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:44.420]   they can shoot a 4K video on their regular camera body
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.620]   and compare it to the phone and think it's going
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.900]   to look the same as not.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.300]   It's just physics is different there.
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.300]   But I like what Apple is doing from a computational side.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.580]   And plus, all of this is written on their own chip.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.180]   So it's probably going to be pretty dankum sweet
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.260]   if you know what you're doing.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.780]   Yeah, I mean, this is the constant conundrum
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.340]   if you're an Apple iPhone user is, well,
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.060]   should I spend $1,000 there here?
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.460]   More or less to have the newest phone
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.540]   or should I wait a year or two?
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.340]   Someone asked me on Twitter yesterday about it.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.180]   And I said, you know, it would be fine to,
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.220]   if I fall, I won, it was the camera,
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.060]   but it's $1,200, just for the camera.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.140]   I'd rather spend $1,200 on say something like that.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.540]   I think it was S5 here.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.940]   Something like that.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.980]   But if it's just the phone.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.700]   Leo was Leo, hold on, man, was Leo being heretical
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.700]   when he said soon you're not going to need an SLR?
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.820]   Is that a hype cycle or is that, do you see a day
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.740]   without an SLR?
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.940]   No.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.220]   No, no.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.500]   We're going to always have those.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.140]   Yeah, we're going to always have those larger sensor sizes
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.300]   because they just add a different look and different value.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.940]   And then you have lenses that you can attach
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.260]   to those sensors that you can attach to a phone.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.860]   So yeah, we're going to always have big camera bodies,
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.660]   some sort.
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.340]   I have to say though on him, yeah,
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.260]   on my next trip in about eight, nine years,
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.540]   whenever I get to go out.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.460]   I would probably with the old folks home.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.100]   Yeah, maybe my next trip to the old folks home,
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:25.300]   I would maybe consider because it is a pain to carry a big kit
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.300]   and all the lenses and all that stuff.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.940]   And yeah, you get a better shot.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.540]   But if how good is good enough is the question.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.220]   And if you get, if you can get really good,
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.260]   you know, adequately good pictures
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.340]   from a camera phone that you're going to carry anyway,
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.020]   it starts to look pretty appealing, I have to say.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:50.100]   I will say this, the average person would probably enjoy
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.540]   that GoPro Hero 9 black that we just reviewed on hands on tech
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.540]   this past Monday.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.940]   It looks pretty good.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.060]   And that's pretty small.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.060]   That's a little powerful.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.260]   It's small, something to carry around pretty easily.
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.580]   And if there's people that wanted to do their whole vlog
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.180]   and or whatever, it's easy to hold and it's not heavy
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:09.980]   or anything like that.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.180]   And it's going to look pretty diagram good.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.980]   I'm not going to say it's going to be a cinematic masterpiece,
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.580]   but it's going to look good for what most people want to do.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.620]   And didn't you have the built in stabilization?
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.180]   Just go watch the review.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.300]   Yeah, do watch the review hands on tech.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.380]   I'll be watching it because I got it.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:27.380]   Don't listen to me.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.580]   Go watch the review.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.980]   Here's some, here's some pictures from Apple shot on the iPhone
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.980]   and some traditionally difficult now.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.340]   As somebody, I think was you,
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.860]   and pointed out what they don't tell you is, you know,
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.420]   this guy, the photographer has $1,200 worth of lights.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.420]   Lights?
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.580]   Always.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.900]   They never mention that.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:48.820]   They don't mention that.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.940]   You can tell that because you can see out the door
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.180]   and the outside where it's very bright is perfectly exposed.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.020]   So is the inside.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.740]   So clearly there's fill lights.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.340]   You know, I mean, you know, so you can't really judge,
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.340]   but the low light performance.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:02.980]   That looks good.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:03.900]   That's computational.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.660]   That's computational because you see how bright
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.660]   the neon sign is on the right.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.060]   He's this guy sitting in front of the motel
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.060]   is sitting under bright light.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.900]   But yet we still see detail in the,
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.180]   and this I don't think is professionally lit the,
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.580]   the Macadam on the parking lot ahead of him,
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.340]   but you still see detail in that.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.260]   That would be normally very dark with these two bright spots
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.060]   and noisy.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.500]   Yeah, that's another thing.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.340]   That's a regionalism.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:29.740]   What?
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.780]   Macadam.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.580]   (laughing)
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.380]   First is Macadam.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.180]   What are you talking about?
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.020]   I just rolled with it.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.020]   Second is Blacktop.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.020]   Blacktop.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:36.860]   It's asphalt.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.860]   Asphalt.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.700]   Asphalt.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.700]   Patrement.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:41.900]   Oh, I can backadam.
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.180]   I think that really does pinpoint me from Worcester.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.580]   Here's another one with neon and another skateboarder.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.980]   Apparently they love skateboarders these Apple guys do.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.100]   This is also hard.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.700]   As anybody knows, who's looked at neon from,
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.420]   from the outside and said, oh, I'd love to get a picture of that.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.940]   Right, Aunt, that's hard.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.420]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.180]   It usually blows it out.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.220]   Yeah, the pet is going to get all--
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.780]   You're supposed to have neon or none of the neon.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.980]   Exactly.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.700]   Exactly.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.220]   And this is perfect, right?
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.380]   And then this is a portrait.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.980]   You know, the other thing is that the selfie camera is going to have
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.220]   many of these features as well, which is the first--
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.140]   There's will be the best-looking selfies.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.180]   Anybody--
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.660]   They took a page out of the Samsung Playbook.
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.700]   Yes, Samsung.
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.420]   Samsung puts a lot of energy into their front-facing camera.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.740]   I feel like Samsung over-beautifies though.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.780]   That's what people want it though.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.140]   I'm just trying to report.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:36.620]   Right.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.260]   They smooth it out.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.460]   It's not going to look good.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.420]   Yeah, I don't like that.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.180]   You don't want to look like your rubby cells.
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.060]   Not when you're our age.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.020]   You don't want to.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:43.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.220]   I guess--
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.740]   No, when you're young, you don't want to either.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.340]   So true.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.460]   No one.
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.420]   No one.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.700]   Everybody wants to look good.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.900]   All right.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.660]   I don't know what we're talking about, Apple.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.660]   I guess the idea was we were going to compare it to the pixel.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.460]   And I really wanted to get Stacy's take on 5G.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.940]   I won't give up on 5G yet.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.620]   I mean, is it hype 100%?
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.260]   Is it hype that will eventually turn into our day-to-day reality
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.420]   that we can't live without also 100%?
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.620]   I don't know 100% of that.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.700]   I say remains to be seen but possible.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.780]   Well, so what you're going to skip to 6G?
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.420]   I'm just going to say you're wrong with me.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:17.660]   Really?
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.580]   You really think it's absolutely going to transform everything.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.900]   Yes.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.420]   In the sense that if we want to keep moving forward on this,
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.180]   we are going to use 5G.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:29.660]   I have to do it.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.140]   100%.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:30.700]   OK.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.580]   I'll give it to you then.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.780]   Well, we can--
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.540]   I won't be so cranky about it.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.260]   Well, what's that said?
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.140]   I won't be here in a year.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.580]   And I can be like, Leo.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.420]   How's that 5G treat?
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.380]   No, no, Miss Stacy will be--
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.060]   And then you can send me your thermo mix.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.060]   As a reward?
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.300]   He says never.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.340]   As a reward?
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.460]   No, no, Miss Stacy, with that said,
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.820]   do you think we'll still be in the same position
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:00.860]   where people are giving deals for unlimited data,
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.340]   like the big boys at Verizon and things like that?
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.940]   Otherwise, they're charging you for your actual data a lot
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.900]   in each month.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.020]   Because I remember when 4G LTE came out,
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.660]   everybody mentioned in their bylines that,
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.140]   you know what?
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.140]   You're going to burn through your data because it's so fast
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.500]   and it's going to cost you more money.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.460]   Are you seeing any more conversations like that now
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.900]   with the talk of 5G and better performance?
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.460]   What 5G is going to offer you?
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:32.140]   And this is part of, again, the 3GPP standards.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.260]   So they've got different--
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.060]   they've got these different revolutions.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.420]   Is it revolutions?
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:37.900]   I think so.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.580]   They're revays, revbes, whatever,
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.740]   for each different iteration.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:42.220]   Revisions?
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.260]   Revisions?
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.220]   Revisions?
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.180]   That's what they're saying.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.340]   Say you want a resolution.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:54.220]   But with some of those involved things
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:59.740]   that will allow carriers to offer--
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.100]   we're just going to-- it's going to kill that neutrality.
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.860]   You're going to offer managed services
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.020]   for your master license with the new ones, right?
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.140]   They're going to have to, right?
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:12.380]   Because I'm going to start downloading my Netflix at HDR 4K
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.260]   in three seconds.
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.740]   And there's my bandwidth for the month.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.700]   Done.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.180]   So the pricing plans are going to change
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.660]   around what you want to do.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:27.260]   And I'm actually really intrigued by how this is going to play.
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.180]   I suspect knowing--
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.900]   now, again, remember, I think Verizon is the evil empire.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.260]   They're greedy.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:34.460]   I suspect--
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.300]   --money, rubbish, innovation,
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.340]   innovation, hammering.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:42.860]   The whole point of this is they would very much like to bypass
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:47.740]   all this federal regulation on what you can do with networks.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.220]   And they see this really as a gold mine.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.860]   And also difficult to regulate gold mine.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.620]   And I think that's why--
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.620]   They're putting a lot of money into it for a good reason.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.300]   I think they're wrong.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.020]   They have always operated from a scarcity model.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.380]   And there are physics at play that make the scarcity model
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.980]   make sense in some elements, in some parts of this, right?
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:16.300]   But fundamentally, they do not--
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.660]   it would be so much smarter for them to operate it
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.340]   on an abundance model like we have with, like, computing
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.180]   or semiconductor performance.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:25.660]   Mm-hmm.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.540]   You know, no one says, I'm going to charge you
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:32.380]   based on the core, Oracle actually tried way back in the day.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:38.780]   But it became so obvious that when you have more of an underlying technology
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:44.940]   and you can provide that, people build entire, you know, new economies on it.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.380]   And that's what's happened.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.580]   But it slowed down a lot because the carriers have not thought about it that way.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.620]   And that's why we see companies going around it
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.020]   and things like Wi-Fi and even Wi-Max.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:04.620]   And I think what's about to happen is we're about to start seeing more distributed
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.340]   and different business models work connectivity, not for your phone,
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.980]   but for, like, connected devices that are going to be very different
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.500]   from what the carrier model looks like.
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.060]   Mm-hmm.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:16.380]   So--
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.180]   That's where your IoT expertise comes into place,
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.740]   because that's the issue with IoT,
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.740]   of all these little devices. They all need bandwidth.
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.900]   They don't even need a lot of bandwidth, but they all need bandwidth.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.220]   And most importantly, they need ubiquity bandwidth.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.460]   And that's one of the offers here.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.180]   It's not just the speed, it's the ubiquity.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.980]   5G is not ubiquitous yet, but it will talk--
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.180]   I mean, like, next week I've got the sidewall people coming up my desk
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:41.820]   and that's going to be--
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:41.820]   Oh, good.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:41.820]   --and it's going to be--
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.780]   Oh, please, both.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:43.340]   I can't wait.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.900]   And I write about this all the time on the IoT network side.
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.180]   And that's why things like Starlink are going to be really important, or other--
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:49.980]   Mm-hmm.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:54.460]   Yeah, your IoT devices don't need the 5G, they just need connectivity, right?
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.100]   Right.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.300]   It depends on the device.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.380]   And Starlink has it, by the way, the same problem,
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.140]   which isn't going through the roof.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.380]   So just as you will with the millimeter wave 5G,
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.220]   you'll have a collector on the roof,
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.100]   which will then go through Wi-Fi into your house.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.340]   Because unlike--
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:09.900]   Starlink.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.260]   Unlike self-service right now, which does go through walls,
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.900]   increasingly we're going to see bandwidth that doesn't, right?
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.220]   Uh, I mean, for some of it, yes, but not all of it.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:26.780]   We still have-- I mean, the 2G spectrum and even the 3G spectrum,
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.580]   they're starting to repurpose the 3G spectrum starting next year.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.060]   Oh, perfect.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.260]   And that's a beautiful spectrum.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:31.740]   See, there you go.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.460]   Right.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.660]   That's very low frequency.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.620]   That gets through everything.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.340]   That's actually a good idea.
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.460]   Don't decommission it, repurpose it.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.460]   Oh, well, that's what they do.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.220]   Well, they don't always do that.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.540]   I don't think there's many edge networks floating around anymore.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.060]   [laughs]
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.500]   Oh, but they did repurpose then.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.940]   I mean, they reuse that spectrum.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.980]   You repack it.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.460]   Reuse the spectrum.
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.180]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.300]   When we come back,
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.660]   Google's having an event tomorrow.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.380]   Did you know that?
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.900]   What?
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:01.420]   Going on with them and Oracle again.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.580]   You all are going to help me decide
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.180]   whether we should stream it live.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:05.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.740]   Well, Oracle, you know, was part of the hearings today.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.860]   So we can talk about that too.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.220]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:12.700]   Okay.
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:13.900]   Okay.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.580]   Did they ask Amy Coney Barrett what she would do
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.860]   about Google versus Oracle?
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.340]   How she feels about software APIs?
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:25.260]   No, it was Sheldon Whitehouse, who's really smart.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.580]   Smart from my home state of Providence, Rhode Island.
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:35.100]   So no, it was that all the amicus briefs or a meeky or a meek.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.380]   Meeky or what the channel of amicus.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.020]   Yeah, well.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:41.900]   So the amicus briefs that he asked her,
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.260]   would you meet with a party in a case while the case is on?
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.020]   How are you trying to fool me?
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.420]   No, no, why not?
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.140]   He says, because it'd be wrong.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.020]   Right, it'd be wrong.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:53.580]   It'd be wrong.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.060]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.140]   So he leads her down the path and--
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.180]   Oh, that's sneaky.
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.180]   Very sneaky.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.740]   And then basically get all these amicus briefs.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:06.700]   But not knowing who's behind them is an issue.
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.020]   So in the Google versus Oracle case,
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:14.380]   Oracle paid $90,000 to a party who wrote an amicus brief.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.300]   So a party in the case.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.460]   Both sides were doing that, by the way.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.020]   Both were OK.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:19.980]   He just mentioned Oracle.
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.380]   Yeah.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:24.140]   So but a party in the case is also finally an amicus briefs.
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.500]   You know, shouldn't that be the--
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.020]   shouldn't you be watching that for that, Judge?
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.020]   Oh, I didn't know that went on.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.860]   So--
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:31.980]   Well, that's not exactly it.
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.380]   Gotcha.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.060]   No, it wasn't quite.
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:39.340]   It was a larger piece about ethics and the court.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.500]   He did some really good stuff.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.380]   I'm not sure how you say a meeky or a meeky in--
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.500]   Meeky, as I say.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.100]   In your neck of the woods--
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:47.900]   Or the country.
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.860]   In Rome, where we still speak Latin, I say amici.
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.580]   Oh, because you went to.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:58.780]   I studied Latin at high school, actually.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.580]   So church Latin would be amici.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:07.740]   The Latin I learned, you say amici, the Caesar always hard,
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.620]   which is weird.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:12.380]   And that was closer to the fall of the Roman Empire.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.260]   That was the theory.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.140]   Well, listen to you.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:18.300]   That was-- yes, right, way back when people still remembered
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.740]   how Latin was spoke.
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:23.980]   Our show today brought you a nice job, Stacy.
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.740]   The world is changing fast.
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.140]   When you're my age, it's changing off fast.
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:34.940]   You want to build new ways to help customers to communicate, right?
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:36.620]   That's what Twilio does so well.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.060]   Engage customers wherever they are on any channel,
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.340]   from text messages to emails to phone calls to video.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:48.700]   And more with one powerful platform that's easy for your developers
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:50.220]   to code for.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.340]   It's so good.
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.420]   And let me tell you, it's at scale.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:58.380]   Twilio powers 795 billion plus interactions across channels
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.140]   with five nines of uptime.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:05.660]   Three billion phone numbers, more than 100 countries.
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:06.620]   That's Twilio.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.140]   Shopify use.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.220]   You use Twilio because you use--
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.660]   I'm sure you use platforms that use Twilio if you use Shopify.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.220]   They run their entire global context center.
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:19.020]   More than a million customers on Twilio's Flex,
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.860]   their programmable context center solution.
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:27.180]   Blue Apron sends its newsletter emails with Twilio's Send Grid.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.740]   Netflix, you use two-factor on Netflix.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.700]   That's Twilio.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.780]   In fact, Twilio makes my favorite
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:36.220]   two-factor authentication program, Authy.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:40.380]   They give it away for free, but the back ends all Twilio.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.940]   Ride sharing and contactless delivery services,
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:48.780]   like Lyft and Uber, connect riders and drivers with text messaging from you guessed it, Twilio.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.300]   Twilio's used all over.
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.780]   I actually have had a Twilio account for years because it's fun to develop for.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:51:00.220]   Product and operations teams use Twilio to create new ways to communicate with their users
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:05.340]   inside applications ranging from account notifications with text messaging to chat bots
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.860]   to securing online accounts with two-factor authentication.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.820]   The thing I love about Twilio, you don't have to be a specialized
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.500]   telecom network engineer.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:19.020]   To use it to build incredible communications apps, if you already know how to do web apps,
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:23.900]   you can build apps like text, chat, call, video conferencing.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:27.580]   Marketing teams use Twilio to get the word out connecting with leads over text messaging
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:32.220]   and phone calls using email campaigns to build chat bots.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:35.020]   Yes, they've got chat bots to answer questions.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:38.380]   And of course, that Twilio Flex is so great for customer service teams.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:42.220]   It's the easiest way to build global contact and support centers.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.860]   It starts out of the box working great, but it's fully programmable.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.620]   So you can make it do exactly what you need to do.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.300]   That's kind of the idea, Twilio.
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.940]   Twilio is power that you can use to do what you need to do.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:52:00.620]   Strengthen your customer relationships by uniting communications across your entire business.

[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:08.300]   That's twilio.com.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.660]   It's time to build.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:17.020]   It's called search on.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.500]   It's a live stream event.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.860]   It's going to be tomorrow.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:28.700]   It's a surprise to highlight the latest improvements to Google search.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.500]   Is this for I don't know who this is for.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.500]   Let me look at the search.
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.940]   Not for me because they didn't invite me.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:39.340]   You don't have to get invited either to put them out there because I just saw it somewhere.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:45.260]   Yeah, I searched Google search on if you go to search on dot with google.com October 15th.
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:50.860]   12 p.m. Pacific will be probably doing another show, but that's all it says.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.620]   I don't know anything about it.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.060]   I guess they've done these before.
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.220]   We could stream it right now.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:06.780]   I hear Kent Brockman from the Simpsons saying this barely qualifies as.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:15.100]   Oh, I've been spanked by the Pruitt.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:21.020]   OK, Google search on will reveal new AI powered features on Thursday.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.100]   Says in gadget.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.820]   You know, if you get attention.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:26.300]   What is it? What is it?
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.740]   I powered these days.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:28.620]   I don't know.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.580]   Oh, it.
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:33.740]   Yeah, you want to say that hype.
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.380]   Let's talk about that.
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:35.180]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:35.820]   It's a good part.
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.700]   We're not going to do it.
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.980]   You can watch it if you want to.
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:38.620]   I don't see any reason.
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.500]   Well, you could right now.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:43.020]   Wait, Leo, Leo, you could right now at this very moment.
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.700]   Yeah, be in on zoom zoom topia.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.180]   It's live as we speak.
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:50.540]   Oh, no, no.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.020]   You know where you want to be right now is the smart kitchen summit,
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.540]   which is actually really cool and fun.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.620]   That's where Stacy wants to be right now.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:57.500]   I'm just telling you.
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.220]   Right now I would like to be at that, actually.
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:02.540]   Talking about hacking kitchen devices,
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:05.100]   building robots for restaurants.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.980]   But no, I'm here with y'all and y'all are great.
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.380]   But robots are pretty cool too.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.260]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.300]   I got a kitchen robot.
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:12.940]   I give you that.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.980]   And I know you want it.
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.540]   You can't have.
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:19.740]   I met a developer there yesterday who was on the cookie do platform.
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.780]   Oh, the cookie do.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:25.660]   It makes me a little angry that I have to pay a lot of money for a thermomix
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:29.100]   and then subscribe to cookie do for 40 bucks a year.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.100]   Well, you don't have to subscribe to it.
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.420]   Oh, but the thing I like about it.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.860]   Tell them the thermomix.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.860]   The features you like require that.
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:39.500]   Yeah, because you get because you search for a recipe
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.700]   and it says, OK, I got one.
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:44.860]   And then it says and the top of the lid on the thermomix goes
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:50.380]   and it says, OK, now put 400 grams of sugar in my lid.
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.900]   I my thing this week you're going to enjoy.
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:54.620]   OK, all right.
[00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.860]   So while we're on this for a second,
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.860]   I've been meaning to ask you guys this because you'll know the answer.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.180]   What's the deal with the Braava oven?
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:04.540]   Oh, you see a lot of that for that right now, don't you?
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:07.100]   Oh, the Braava, the steam oven.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.180]   No, no, no, no, no, just the light.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.700]   Well, that's the Tovala light.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.620]   Braava is light.
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:13.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.420]   So this is a radiant heat oven.
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:23.180]   Yeah, where you cook three different things at three different temperatures on the same plate.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.540]   Oh, that's interesting. Huh.
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.540]   Yeah, that's very fast.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:30.940]   It's just I mean, I have a radiant.
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.500]   A fan of any intelligent radiant radiant.
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.100]   Radiant heat is not anything new.
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.940]   It's just infrared heat.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:40.780]   I don't know.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.580]   It's another gadget.
[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.020]   I'll let you buy this one, Stacy.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:49.660]   No, I mean, I don't I am excited about anything that gives you the ability to
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:53.020]   cook things well faster without spending a lot of money.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:53.980]   I am too.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.700]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.260]   So I am excited about the Braava.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:58.540]   This is a big category.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:03.580]   I mean, basically you put an Android device on an oven and then you have you have online
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:06.780]   connectivity. You have a library of recipes and you can, you know,
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.940]   well, why we said we're going to get any of this stuff.
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.260]   And we have to redo the entire kitchen because we can't.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.940]   Yeah, you can't just build for all this.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.460]   No, that's all about counter space.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:19.180]   Oh, so that was one of the conversations yesterday that I found so fascinating.
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.500]   We were talking about so a big topic.
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.860]   Do you all want to talk about food tech?
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.660]   Sure.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:24.140]   Sure.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:29.900]   So a big topic in food tech is the recipe.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.500]   And what's frustrating is there's no like XML for recipes.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:33.980]   Right.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:41.500]   So everyone feels, I think rightly, that recipes are kind of the connective tissue between like
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:49.420]   your device and like an assistant or your shopping app, you know, whatever you use.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:55.500]   But all of the none of the players in the industry want to invest in like an XML for
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:00.540]   recipes. Instead, they want to put their own recipes tied to their devices.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.180]   So you, you know, they want to say, Leo, you subscribe to that.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.300]   Yeah, they want to say.
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:04.780]   Well, yeah.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.980]   So it's a huge source of frustration for everyone.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:12.140]   And no one is yet to the point like at the smart home, like now we're getting into this
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.460]   possible standardization.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.460]   No one's at that point yet for recipes.
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:20.460]   So everyone in the industry, it's so funny to watch because everyone is like,
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.420]   waiting in a way for things to talk to each other.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.380]   And it's like right there in front of them.
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.580]   And they're like, no, we don't want to do that for recipes.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:33.500]   So it's super frustrating.
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:41.740]   Yeah, there used to be a format, the mealmaster format, but in the early days of computers,
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:47.660]   this was a balancing your checkbooks and keeping track of your recipes were two of the most
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.340]   popular things you could do.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:54.220]   And then for a while, there was a program called mealmaster and there was a standard format and a
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:59.580]   lot of websites sprung up where you could download recipes in the mealmaster format and a lot of
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:02.380]   people supported it. And then it just kind of faded away.
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:05.740]   I think Broderbund bought them with everything else and then just disappeared it.
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.780]   But, oh, but Jeff, this was my point.
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:12.060]   And I forgot about my point because I'm kind of not all here.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:15.340]   The point is the people who are, I have a migraine,
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:21.820]   the people who are developing recipes, they have to develop for the lowest common denominator
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:27.100]   in the kitchen, which means an oven that maybe doesn't have an internal temperature probe
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.700]   and a dehydrate setting.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:33.500]   So you've got in that's, I didn't really think about that, but it's kind of fascinating as we
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.660]   get these more sophisticated devices out there.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:39.820]   Yeah, you can't, like they need their recipes.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.500]   That's why the you'll pay is 40 bucks.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.780]   Exactly. Oh, it's 40 bucks a month, Leo?
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:45.820]   No, no, a year.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.020]   Oh, thank God.
[00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:48.380]   I wouldn't pay for it.
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.780]   I pay 60 bucks a year for the New York Times.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:53.980]   But you know, what would be cool is if instead of the, yeah, I do too.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:55.100]   I pay for the New York Times.
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:59.100]   What would be cool though is that there were what you're saying is interoperability.
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:02.700]   Like the recipes I got from New York Times cooking, I could put into my
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.780]   thermomix or my brava.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:08.460]   But you've got to then rewrite every recipe for these different mechanisms.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.260]   Here's what I do.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.700]   Yeah, the brava does it.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:11.820]   So yeah, that's interesting.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:15.820]   Heaven wants to dial in and tell you, Jeff, that the brava needs a 5G connection.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:20.300]   Otherwise it cooks really slow.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.420]   Otherwise, yeah, it's cooking at the speed of light, y'all.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:23.580]   Okay.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:24.460]   Somebody in the chat room.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.940]   Leo who was saying who needs stereo before it.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:27.660]   Yeah, it's not me.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:27.980]   It's not me.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:27.980]   It's not me.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:28.460]   It's not me.
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:33.180]   Somebody in the chat room said, and I think they're actually right, that the brava is just a really big,
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:34.060]   easy bake oven.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:38.620]   But that's actually, I mean, it's a smarter, easy bake oven.
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:40.620]   It's got three bulbs instead of one.
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.940]   The, you can go online.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.580]   I just searched for a meal master.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:52.540]   You can go online and download giant databases of meal master recipes, all in the meal master format.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.460]   So it's, it's still out there.
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:58.700]   These are all, these are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of recipes
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.860]   from a variety of sources in the meal master format.
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.420]   But Stacey, you know about Paprika probably, right?
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:08.140]   The spice?
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.620]   Yes.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.340]   No.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.980]   Like the spice you stick on just a few.
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:15.500]   You've heard of Cayenne, have you?
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:15.900]   No, no.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:22.940]   This is a recipe app that works on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.380]   It is fantastic.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.940]   And what it will do is it's, it's, it's got a very intelligent scraper.
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:33.100]   So if the recipe exists on a web page, it's got a browser built in.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.620]   You can surf to the web page and say, scrape this recipe.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.140]   And it's very good.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:41.820]   It divides it into ingredients and instructions.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.700]   It'll take the picture.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.700]   If there's a picture, any information that's on that website,
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.300]   it can import from the web.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.060]   So it doesn't have a lingua franca.
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:54.060]   I wish it did because I can't then use it for, you know, cooking with other devices.
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.540]   But it is one way to get recipes into your computer.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.180]   I like it.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:57.980]   I'm going to try it out.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.500]   So we got highly recommended.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.860]   It's fantastic.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:07.580]   Way back when, when we started Epicurious, and I was there, we had, we hired monks,
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.300]   literally monks to retype years and years and years of gourmet and bone-epity recipes.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:12.700]   Wow.
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.460]   There was no way to figure it out at the time.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.340]   It was just so long ago.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.700]   96.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.820]   Yeah, but one monks.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.380]   Wow.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:20.940]   My monks.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.580]   Because they were cheap.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.860]   They're cheap.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.020]   Rather than making beer or...
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.700]   Are you sure you didn't hire monkeys?
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.020]   Because they're really cheap.
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.100]   No monks.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:31.980]   They did good work.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.380]   Wow.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.340]   That's all bottom line.
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:36.700]   That's really interesting.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.340]   I know.
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:41.020]   So these were the monks who are used to being scriptoria.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:41.420]   Exactly.
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.820]   But Gutenberg could have had a business.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.820]   They're no longer illuminating manuscripts.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.100]   They're just doing data and stuff.
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.180]   It all comes back to Gutenberg.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.260]   It's all, it's all Gutenberg's fault.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.700]   It's back to Gutenberg.
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.700]   I hope you said that.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:57.500]   I hope you said, you know why we can get these monks so cheap?
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.020]   Gutenberg.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.180]   Gutenberg.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.900]   So the effort of the book,
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.180]   which I haven't taken to an editor yet,
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.820]   I just got finished in a bit of it.
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.420]   So it's now 335 pages.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.300]   So I've got more to go.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.220]   A lot more to go.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:18.460]   And so I put it all in one file on Google Docs.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.980]   Oh, was that a mistake?
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.340]   Uh-oh.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.380]   Lasses.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.180]   Oh, that's too bad.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.620]   Oh, my lord.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.260]   It wouldn't take it.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.620]   How frustrating is that?
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.980]   Really frustrating.
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.100]   It's now seven pieces.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:34.220]   And that's why on-prem is not dead.
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:38.300]   The cloud can't do it all, friends.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.020]   You want to do a change log.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.220]   I want to do a change log.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.500]   God knows the audience.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:43.820]   Ready?
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:44.140]   What do you want to do?
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:44.860]   Change log?
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:46.300]   It's early for a change log.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.420]   Can't win with this guy.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.420]   Sometimes it's too early.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:50.540]   Sometimes it's too late.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:54.300]   Okay, do your change log.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.660]   It was much longer before.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.540]   How did it get cut down?
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.980]   Carsten went in and did some-
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:01.100]   Probably there was stuff in there we'd already done.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:01.820]   I don't know.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:02.860]   I don't know.
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.260]   Yeah, it was longer.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:05.660]   What happened?
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.660]   It's this incredible shrinking change log.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:08.940]   You want to do a change log, Ant?
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:12.300]   Incredible shrinking change log.
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:13.900]   The four item change log.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:14.940]   You want to do a change log?
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:18.060]   Play the trumpets.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.100]   The dance.
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.020]   The Google change log.
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.140]   Yeah, it had like 12 items.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:24.700]   What happened?
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.460]   All the stuff in the change log.
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.740]   First then, what did you do to the change log?
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:28.780]   This is pretty boring.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.220]   Most of it was boring, you said.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:36.620]   Google makes a big push to integrate
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:39.340]   and let you control Android apps with Assistant.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.180]   We-
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.260]   That's what was left.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.500]   The storage stuff went.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.180]   And that's what we want to-
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:50.140]   This is actually what Bixby could do.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.660]   But now you'll be able to say,
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.260]   "Hey, you know who send a message to Rachel on Discord or
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:00.620]   search for candles on Etsy or log a berry smooth me on my fitness pal.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:01.820]   That would be awesome.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:05.740]   Check my accounts on Mint Titan, my shoes with Nike Adapt."
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:10.140]   Did you know that there is a way to tighten your shoes
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.180]   with your smartphone?
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.420]   You knew about the Nike Adapt?
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.780]   Well, my device doesn't-
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:17.740]   It's my job.
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:20.300]   I feels like that would be risky.
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:24.060]   Like, could it over tighten your shoes?
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.420]   No.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:25.740]   Okay.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.860]   There's sensors so it doesn't-
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.300]   Man, what is happening with my head?
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.100]   Oh no, my foot is gone.
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.780]   I like the Adapt?
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.580]   Yeah, I'm crazy.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.100]   Like, it's not going to amputate your foot.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.220]   That's not that strong.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:36.540]   Okay.
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.660]   I think we need you to do a review, Miss Stacy.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:42.220]   Yeah, would you please order a smoothie with Postmates,
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.220]   send a snap with cartoon lens.
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:44.860]   This is good.
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:50.460]   Already 30 apps, 30 of the top Google Play apps have voice commands.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:52.940]   Now, I have to say, this is something Apple's had for a while,
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.140]   but it's much more manual.
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.060]   You have to do it with shortcuts.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.940]   It's something Bixby kind of pivoted to when it realized they couldn't compete
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.780]   against Google and Amazon.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:05.900]   So they made Bixby more of a way to operate your phone.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:13.900]   Now, according to Google, you don't need to swipe when your hands are full.
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:18.460]   Oh, I didn't realize I could log stuff under my fitness panel.
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.340]   I use that all the time.
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.340]   Yeah, I like that one.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:21.660]   Right.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.180]   Yeah, you could say, hey, I just had a smoothie.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.620]   Tell my, that's cool.
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:31.340]   So they're also allowing you to do, and this is very much Apple's shortcuts.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:33.420]   In fact, it's even called shortcuts.
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.140]   If you want, instead of saying, you know, add a smoothie,
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:40.460]   hey, you know, who add a smoothie to my fitness pal,
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:43.180]   you could just say, hey, you know, who oops,
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:47.820]   I did it again, and it would just add it for you, which would be nice.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.940]   Or you could say, uh, lace it.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:51.980]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.420]   I didn't mean to say the G word.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.540]   Hey, you know who will lace it all across, all across
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.580]   the podcast world and say it.
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.540]   I don't know how to do that.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.140]   I do what I don't do.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:06.540]   So this is part, this will be part of, uh, I don't know if it's part of Android 11,
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:10.620]   or if you can, if you'll be getting it soon.
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:14.140]   This is actually part of Google Assistant Developer Day,
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.540]   which is another thing I missed.
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.900]   So maybe Google, not their own show back.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.340]   That was last week, Kevin.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:21.820]   Okay.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:25.900]   They also announced that's where, oh no, that was accessibility day.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:26.460]   Never mind.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.500]   They have all these days.
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.300]   They didn't tell us.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.700]   Yeah, we're not going to invite you to their days.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.100]   Geez.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.140]   So many.
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:33.020]   So there you go.
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.220]   There's one cool thing.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:34.860]   How about this?
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:39.500]   Uh, the Android, this new feature of Android that will allow you to use your
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.900]   Nest devices to listen for critical sounds, a dog barking,
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.740]   smoke alarms.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:51.660]   Yeah, they did that for Google Assistant on your phone for people who are hard of hearing.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:51.980]   Right.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.500]   They did 10 sounds.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.340]   Oh, so it's not just your Nest devices.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:56.860]   This is the microphone on your phone.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.780]   Oh, this is your phone.
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:01.020]   I don't actually think it works on the Nest devices.
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:01.820]   Yeah.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:05.980]   Cause they, they do glass break and burglar alarms.
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.380]   The Nest devices already have done some of this stuff,
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.860]   but this is new in Android and Wear OS devices.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:15.340]   It'll use a microphone in your phone to listen for things like beeping appliances,
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.820]   running water, barking dogs, and then it will either send you a push notification,
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:22.460]   a vibration or flash the light on your camera.
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.420]   That's pretty cool.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:29.820]   But you will have to turn it on and accessibility is not on by default.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.660]   I really like that.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.780]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:37.180]   That's, that's using that, you know, the AI to help people.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:44.780]   Google has opened Assistant smart displays to interactive education and storytelling apps.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:50.860]   So if you have a Nest hub max or one of those displays,
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.380]   now they can, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.260]   You know what I'm talking about.
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:55.580]   I do.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.340]   I'm laughing because they keep changing the name.
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.940]   I can't remember the freaking name.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:03.500]   You know that kind of thing that the screen or the Lenovo thing or the thing with the thing.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.860]   So here's how you can do this.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.940]   There'll be an education and storytelling hub.
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:11.820]   You'll say, hey, you know who tell,
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:17.740]   teach me something new, which will open a carousel with categories of things you can
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:21.500]   learn like learn a language, discover the world, pick up a new skill.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.820]   That's neat.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:24.780]   That sounds fun.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.180]   Will it bug me every day like do a lingo does?
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:27.740]   I hope so.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.460]   I hope not.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:31.020]   And don't you, don't you hate it that Google assistants now,
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.340]   like after you ask it to, so I said at the time,
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:36.540]   I said, oh, and here's a pro tip and it goes on and on and on.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:42.380]   Well, Amazon and Google, I know that I asked them to be proactive,
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.140]   but I need them to be a little less proactive about.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:44.700]   They're trying to teach you.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:45.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:46.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.540]   Like, I wanted that.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.420]   I would have read the email that told me how to do it that you send me every week.
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.660]   Yeah, right.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.140]   That's right.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:54.540]   They do that.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.220]   They send an email, but I guess that's not enough.
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:00.380]   So some more things you can do with Android 11.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.980]   This is from the keyword, Google keyword blog,
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:06.220]   do even more with Google assistant, your favorite apps.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.740]   Oh, we just mentioned that one.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:10.460]   New ways to connect with Google duo.
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:12.060]   Oh, that's something I was waiting for.
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:16.540]   Never thought Google was going away.
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.700]   He's saying, he's being sarcastic.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.140]   You can share your screen.
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:20.620]   I do too.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.220]   I use duo with my daughter.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.900]   You could share your screen or browse photos or plan activities together.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:26.060]   It's not going to happen.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:26.460]   Family.
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:31.260]   If people aren't catching it at a good time, they can leave a video message
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:32.780]   with automatic captions.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.460]   That's nice.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:38.300]   Say goodbye to spam calls with Google's phone app.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:38.780]   Thank you.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:40.860]   That's been working for me today.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:45.900]   I had three calls where you could see the thing come up on the screen saying social security.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.260]   And I know it's a fake call.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:47.820]   Yes.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:48.460]   Nice.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:48.940]   Nice.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:49.740]   Very nice.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.060]   Happy.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.460]   So, well, but I'm still struggling with just plain old D and D.
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:00.060]   I wish the phone wouldn't ring when I'm in D and D because it's still ring when you're
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:00.540]   just a drink.
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:01.020]   This is not ring.
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:02.460]   It shouldn't.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:02.620]   How?
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.420]   It's supposed to ring.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:04.940]   It does not ring.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:05.500]   You tell me.
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.580]   And that's not right.
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:13.100]   And I know I'm not doing what it also happened to my friend, Mr. Jason Levine,
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.260]   during his live stream one day.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.540]   His phone was on D and D and it ringed during his live stream.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:22.380]   Oh, I'm reading this morning while I was TDN floss weekly.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.220]   I doesn't let some numbers through.
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.140]   There's something like that.
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:30.620]   Any time is just a phone call because I don't get a lot of phone calls except for those spam calls.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.020]   You can.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:31.580]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:36.780]   You can say to let your favorites through or let the double rings through stuff like that.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.220]   Maybe you should check the settings.
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.820]   I have to say this is one thing that the iPhone still gets right.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:46.220]   I don't know why more phones don't have physical silence keys or buttons.
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:51.740]   Well, there's a school used to it used to have a thing where if you flipped your phone and stuck it down.
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.020]   I think it still does that.
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:53.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:54.620]   It has a half.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.780]   I don't want to say a bad word.
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:58.620]   So it halfway does it.
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.300]   Half, half, half, half rumpch.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.900]   A half rumpch way of doing it.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:03.020]   Half rumpch way of doing it.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:08.780]   So sometimes when I some of my notifications still come through and I don't know why,
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:13.500]   but I know like when I'm listening to music and I accidentally set my phone down like this,
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.580]   it's like loop and I'm like, oh, right.
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:18.540]   And anyway, oh, but you know what else?
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:18.780]   Okay.
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.100]   I just noticed this and maybe I'll have already noticed this,
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.260]   but I'm going to throw it in the changelog anyway.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:23.580]   Oh, wait.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:23.900]   First.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.020]   Hi, dad.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.100]   Hey, it's Stacy.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.620]   It's Mr. Higginbotham.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.820]   It's the devil getting whipped around the corner devil.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.420]   Devil get in his ass kicked.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:37.660]   What is the devil's worth in his wife?
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:40.140]   The devil's whipping his wife, Mr. Higginbotham.
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.900]   You don't say that anymore.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.740]   Hey, Mr. Higginbotham.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.740]   I hear the devil's whipping his wife.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:48.780]   Sorry, dad.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:49.900]   We were talking about him.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.260]   Sun showers.
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.300]   Sun showers.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.340]   I was like, what's that word?
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:53.900]   Okay.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.740]   But this is the changelog, y'all, or what I was going to tell you.
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:01.660]   The digital wellness thing popped up for me and I actually decided to use it.
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.300]   When you charge your phone after a certain time at night,
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:08.940]   it'll turn it gray and then it will put it on, do not disturb.
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:09.500]   I love that.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.940]   I do that actually because it's less compelling when it's gray scale.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.140]   It is.
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.020]   All those colors make you want to use it as soon as it's black and white,
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:18.780]   it's like, ew, I don't need that.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.780]   You wasn't going to go to color television.
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.180]   Yeah, see.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:25.260]   That's why I didn't want to call on TV.
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:29.100]   By the way, Mars room in our chat room says, if Google's bugging you with pro tips,
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:32.300]   say, okay, Google, no, thank you.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:36.060]   I just turned off the pro tips all over America.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:42.460]   If you tell Alexa to, oh, sorry, y'all, if you tell Madam A to screw you,
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.460]   she will also do the same thing.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.500]   Yeah, I have said that.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.260]   I've been a young couple of times.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:47.740]   Wow.
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.740]   If you tell Siri that, she says, that's not nice.
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:55.980]   I was at a sad place that I was like, I just screamed at an inanimate object.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:59.340]   But that's okay because it is not an inanimate object.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.340]   It has no feelings.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.860]   No, it has no feelings, Stacy.
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:06.540]   But it reflects poorly on you and your control.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.380]   Is that what Mr. Higginbotham taught you?
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:13.580]   My dad is one of the nicest men in the world.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:16.620]   I have never heard him say a bad thing about a person,
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.340]   except for the devil.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.460]   I am not as nice as he is.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:21.260]   I'm not.
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.820]   He's honestly a very nice girl.
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.980]   He's your dad saying, what is this thing you do?
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:26.300]   Why?
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:26.460]   What?
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.220]   No, he's no, no, no, no.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.180]   He knows who Leo is and he's watched the show before.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.820]   No, I bet he is the greatest guy ever.
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:34.780]   I could tell he is.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.940]   He may have already stopped.
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:37.980]   Well, I'll just face you.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.500]   No, I'll tell you something.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.100]   Please don't get sad about this, but he's probably younger than you and me.
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:44.220]   I know.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:44.700]   I know.
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.180]   Oh, boy.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:45.740]   I know.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.220]   And Stacy, don't tell us.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:51.100]   I don't want to know.
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:52.380]   Dad's 43.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:52.700]   I'm.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.500]   Oh my god.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:53.980]   I'm a vision.
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:58.220]   A man with a well-cragmled face.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:02.060]   I'm just not going to.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:02.780]   Incidentally.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.260]   I know.
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:03.980]   Don't say it.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:04.620]   Don't say it.
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:10.460]   Google is also starting to roll out the thing where the duplex,
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:15.100]   where you can get a book, a hair reservation for you or make a reservation in a restaurant.
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.380]   You're promising that for a year and a half.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:16.700]   Yes.
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.580]   We can finally get it.
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:17.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:22.700]   Apparently it's the part of the whole person who gets hair appointments now.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.660]   Yeah, I know.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:24.700]   Just in time, Google.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.900]   Just.
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.260]   Well, now it's able to do it because there's so few being booked.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:32.220]   It's like, OK, finally we can scale this up and error test it.
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:32.700]   Yeah, that's really true.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:33.660]   It's a great time for this to roll out.
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:34.860]   Let's see.
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.700]   How else is your Android getting more useful?
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.740]   New tools for hearing loss.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.140]   We mentioned that communicate with action blocks when you don't use your voice.
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.500]   You probably know something about this.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.100]   Stacey.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.180]   Action Blo.
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.460]   Oh, oh, I see.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:51.020]   So, you know, we've seen these on iPads and things.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:56.220]   People who have autism or can't have difficulty speaking,
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:00.860]   whatever can tap blocks to say something out loud.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:05.340]   It's an artificial voice for people with speech-related disabilities.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.260]   I think that's really cool.
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:11.820]   Thousands of picture communication symbols from Toby Dynavox.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.060]   They're a company that's done this for years,
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:18.700]   making it easier to use the Android app alongside existing speech therapy and special ed materials.
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.780]   That's really neat.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.340]   It's really good.
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:21.500]   Yeah.
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:22.860]   Action Blocks.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:29.020]   And Google, it says, "Enjoy the entertainment you love with a little help from Google."
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:33.500]   That doesn't seem like it has anything new at all.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.620]   It's just a little plug.
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.940]   Of course.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:39.340]   No, little plug is an item number six.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:41.900]   I don't know why that's even there.
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:47.660]   Boy, there was a lot this Google Assistant developer day.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:52.140]   Two new English voices for use in actions with improved prosody model
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:53.980]   to make assistants sound more natural.
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.780]   Actions testing eighties.
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:01.580]   Prosody is where, so if you as a Google voice say,
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:08.940]   "Open the pod bay door, Hal." You can take that and I can add a natural speech prosody.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.740]   Open the pod bay door, Hal, and overlay it.
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:18.780]   And it gives it the cadence, the rhythm, the tempo and pitch shifts that make it sound
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.300]   like more like a human voice.
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.300]   That's something you've been working on for a while.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.140]   So, it's Amazon.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.260]   Do you like doing up speak one?
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:32.060]   I was going to say, "You can accelerate it and give it a higher dynamic or more
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.980]   of a dynamic range and it'll sound like Stacy."
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.100]   Oh my god!
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:35.580]   Whoa!
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:35.580]   Whoa!
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.340]   Open the pod bay door now.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:39.180]   No, no, no.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.620]   You don't sound like that Stacy.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.580]   It sounds like me.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.620]   No, you don't.
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:45.020]   Okay.
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.260]   There's more, actually.
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.820]   But Carson says his boring.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:53.180]   So, and I say, the shorter the bad.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.420]   Carson censored the changelog.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:56.620]   No, we're talking about this.
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:58.060]   You censored it.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.380]   And it should all be there.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.620]   The chat room is actually throwing stuff in.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:04.780]   The chat room is like, "There's a lot of stuff."
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.340]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:05.820]   Here's another one.
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:10.300]   Google completes the worldwide shutdown of the Play Music Store.
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:13.820]   If you were supposed to migrate, if you didn't migrate yet.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.020]   We've been learning about this.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:22.300]   You can know, well, it's not completely done, but you cannot buy music on the Play Store anymore.
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:24.380]   This is kind of sad.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.220]   You know, they've replaced it with YouTube music.
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.220]   And most people have migrated over by now.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:30.940]   You've certainly been offered that option.
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:32.140]   I hope you did.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:35.660]   No more buying music from the Google Play Store.
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:40.220]   Google Calendar side panel adds powerful Google Maps.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.140]   Scooter X is now doing the changelog.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.500]   Shut up, Scooter X.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.020]   Nice job, Scooter X.
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.540]   Got it.
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.260]   And here's another one from the Verge.
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:54.060]   YouTube announces a slate of original series
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:58.140]   dedicated to amplifying black voices.
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:01.660]   It's from the #YouTubeBlackVoices Fund.
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:04.540]   So I don't know if these are documentaries.
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.620]   It's a $100 million fund.
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.060]   The shows include Resist, which is a documentary,
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:14.380]   12 episodes series about injustice in policing bail and incarceration.
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:20.220]   The Onyx Family Dinner, a kid's series about families sharing different perspectives
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:21.980]   and thought-provoking stories.
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:27.500]   Barbershop Medicine, which examines how race impacts health care,
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:33.100]   bear witness take action, part two, a follow-up to a special and racial justice.
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:38.780]   And HBCU, the historically black colleges and universities,
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:43.980]   Homecoming 2020, Meet Me on the Yard, a live stream event to raise money for the United
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:47.260]   Negro College Fund and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:49.180]   So new YouTube content.
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:50.140]   Do more Scooter X.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:51.900]   Thank you, Scooter X.
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.100]   You've just...
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.380]   Carsten didn't do his thing.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:56.140]   You know, Carsten got rid of all this stuff.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:57.820]   You know, technically somebody's got a graph.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.060]   Technically Leo's supposed to put it all in.
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.260]   But I...
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:01.900]   Oh, really?
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:02.780]   Well, yeah.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:06.780]   I mean, my job during the week is to look for stories and clip them.
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:07.980]   But I just...
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:10.540]   Oh, I thought your job was just to stand on camera and talk to people.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.380]   Well, that's really that's all I want to do.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.460]   But unfortunately...
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:14.940]   But I'm fortunate.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:14.940]   But I'm fortunate.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:15.980]   Sometimes you don't even want to do that.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.100]   You're right.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.220]   I put a lot of stuff in it.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.940]   In fact, one I'm very interested right below the change log.
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:21.740]   Once we're done with it.
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.020]   To hear your reaction to.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:23.500]   Okay.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.460]   Maybe it's all news.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:24.860]   I don't know.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.780]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:27.580]   Let's say this.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:28.700]   That's...
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.780]   That's...
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:32.780]   Presidie.
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:36.060]   That's the Guru change log.
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:45.340]   And ripe a like the change log Nvidia creates super zoom.
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.220]   Is this news?
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:47.260]   Is this real?
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:47.900]   Is this helpful?
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:48.620]   Is this for you?
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.260]   Is this for us?
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:50.460]   Well, it's not making me pink?
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:51.340]   It was last week.
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:52.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.980]   Well, we didn't talk about it last week.
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:54.140]   So...
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.100]   We didn't talk about it.
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:55.740]   Yeah.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:58.060]   GPU accelerated AI platform.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.740]   They call it NVIDIA Maxine.
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:03.100]   Will allow video conference providers to improve streaming.
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:05.420]   I did see some of the before and after.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.020]   And it's pretty impressive.
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.060]   This is a problem.
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.980]   Of course, when bandwidth is low, resolution goes down.
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.500]   Something's got to give.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.700]   First is, who's picture is perfect.
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.700]   But there's been drops.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:19.740]   Well, it's bandwidth is not crazy.
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.980]   There've been drops and stuff in the audio.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:22.780]   But the picture...
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:25.260]   You must have told Skype,
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.860]   please, I want a perfect picture.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:29.740]   And I don't care what I sound like.
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:32.860]   That is, that is, that is ants like...
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:33.980]   What is it?
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:34.860]   Calling cars.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:34.860]   Super power.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:36.300]   It's a super power.
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:37.820]   He's brilliant.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.660]   He's brilliant.
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:40.860]   Well, he's also ant.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.300]   I mean, it would be hard to ruin ant.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.140]   You know what, that's true too.
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.420]   Yeah, see.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.460]   So this thing even recognizes the face.
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:51.900]   So if you're looking away from the camera,
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:53.340]   like I was complaining about last week.
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.300]   Yep.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.940]   So think of it as computational conferencing.
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:57.500]   Look at this.
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.500]   It's basically AI that...
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.020]   Here's some of the things it can do.
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:02.140]   This is the one for you.
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:03.020]   Face alignment.
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:06.700]   AI compression, which gets rid of the,
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:09.900]   you know, the artifacts.
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:11.980]   Conversational AI avatar.
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:12.860]   Look like an alien.
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.220]   It'll do translation.
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.180]   It'll denoise.
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.540]   It'll do a virtual background.
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:17.820]   That's always a problem.
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.580]   Because without a green screen,
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.900]   cutting out the person and putting something behind it.
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:22.940]   You've seen it before.
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:23.740]   It's terrible.
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.180]   Terrible.
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.660]   It's getting better though, across the board though, sir.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:30.220]   I was watching CNN the other night.
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:32.460]   They're global coronavirus town hall.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:37.180]   They had a former CDC director who had turned on fake background.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:38.700]   It looked like it was a real background.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.780]   His bookshelf was all nice and everything.
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:42.620]   But he was in his kitchen.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:43.820]   So every time he moved his head,
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:47.100]   you'd see the kitchen table with a beer and then disappear.
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:48.380]   It really ruined the effect.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:49.020]   I'm just saying.
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:51.100]   But it's getting better though.
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:52.300]   It's not as bad as it was.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.340]   That's true.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:54.300]   Four months ago.
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:54.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:55.260]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.460]   Auto frame.
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.780]   The video definitely sounds like something for NVIDIA.
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:02.780]   With, with, they're always dabbling with AI one way or another.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:05.260]   So it makes sense for them to jump into this space.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.060]   So I don't see the video in this Forbes article.
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.180]   You say there's a video.
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:09.580]   No, no, no.
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:12.060]   I have four items in the rundown.
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.420]   Oh, you are so smart.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:14.460]   All right.
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:15.980]   Here's the video demonstration.
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.340]   I'm trying to get Karsten's job.
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:17.820]   I don't mind.
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:18.700]   You can have it.
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:22.540]   Karsten will start teaching journalism at CUNY.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.180]   It's fine.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:27.020]   Karsten, you're doing a great job.
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.140]   That one is awesome.
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:28.780]   Yeah, Pat him on the back.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:30.060]   Yes, you are Karsten.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:31.340]   You're doing a great job.
[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:33.100]   Who's your beautiful little Karsten?
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.540]   You're a boy.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:38.540]   Karsten, if you want to hang up on Leo
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.980]   and just ask the rest of us,
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:40.620]   give it us.
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.140]   Somebody throw Karsten to treat.
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:43.980]   He has no power.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:44.780]   He's at home.
[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.180]   It's Jammer B that has all the power.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:49.180]   I want to know that I wanted Karsten Cam.
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:51.980]   I'm pissed off Leo horribly by demanding Karsten Cam.
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.620]   Oh, you didn't even see him.
[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.580]   He was not happy with you.
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.700]   You didn't piss me off.
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:55.500]   I just said, no.
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.580]   There's a difference.
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.780]   There is a difference.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:01.980]   All right.
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:05.820]   Here, my friends, the virtual meetings of tomorrow
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:07.820]   with NVIDIA AI research.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:11.900]   NVIDIA computer vision researchers just invented something amazing
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:14.060]   that basically replaces a video codec
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.620]   with a neural network, which reduces neural network.
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:21.100]   But neural network is it a generational adversarial neural network?
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.020]   With more than 10 million video streams
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:25.500]   estimated to be live at any given time.
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.380]   Video conferencing is the new connectivity challenge for many.
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:31.260]   So it's just that one on the right is a much lower bandwidth,
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.780]   but it looks as good as the higher bandwidth.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.460]   NVIDIA assisted video calls a symbol.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.140]   A sender first transmits reference.
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:37.900]   Now, see Karsten would have cut this whole segment out.
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.260]   Just like it is system effect.
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:40.860]   Are you calling my segment boring?
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:41.420]   Uh-huh.
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:45.500]   Then rather than sending a fat stream of pixel-packed images,
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.740]   it sends data on the property geeky.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:48.860]   That's a pretty cool.
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:51.340]   Again, this is computational conferencing.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.380]   We're using software to make the whole experience better.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:55.580]   They recognize what's going to happen.
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:56.620]   It's faces.
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:57.820]   Yep, that is beautiful.
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:00.540]   It's giving it a beauty filter.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.540]   They're getting messed up.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:05.980]   But this very low bandwidth presumably, right?
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.340]   Well, the number was earlier, but you went right past it.
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:09.980]   But keep going.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:10.460]   Keep going.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:12.060]   Because now we have--
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:12.780]   Oh, look at that.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:14.380]   So look at the bandwidth.
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:19.660]   Yeah, we're at .12 kilobytes per frame.
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:21.420]   I mean, it's very low bandwidth.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:25.660]   Now, notice the glasses are much better than the mouth.
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.980]   It knows how to do certain things better than others.
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.220]   The Yankees had is perfect.
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.340]   It knows how to do that.
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.340]   Well, the less something moves, the harder--
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:33.500]   Right.
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.420]   You know, the less something moves, the easier it is.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.380]   The harder it is to--
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.980]   Mouth is always going to be hard.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.500]   But actually, this doesn't really get to know.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.140]   Look at that.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.420]   Good definition in the hair.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:41.900]   Yeah, like that same thing.
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.020]   It even works with a mask.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:48.060]   So, Stacy, you think that's because it's been trained
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.500]   on things like masks in hair?
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.740]   I don't know if--
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:54.380]   I don't know if it's just filling in the spot.
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.140]   This is the face alignment.
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:58.380]   So this guy's talking as people often do
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:24:59.820]   over your left shoulder.
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:00.300]   Watch this.
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:10.620]   Although, now he looks like a video game character.
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.860]   It's like that guy who talks to you in every video.
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:15.180]   Now, here's a guy who looks like a video game character.
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.460]   And what are they going to do?
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:17.100]   Sit it off.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.580]   Now he looks like a well-dressed young man.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.780]   He looks like Carsten, actually.
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.020]   No, he's not wearing a bow tie.
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:24.060]   Okay, bow tie.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:26.220]   So this is interesting.
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:27.500]   It's interesting.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:27.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.100]   Of course, I thought,
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.860]   isn't this really the product that Pied Piper was going out with?
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:34.620]   Oh, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.140]   If you go to--
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:37.100]   What is it called?
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.300]   Middle out compression?
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:42.300]   If you just could just use middle out compression,
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:45.500]   the internet we deserve is finally here.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:49.740]   Over the years, Pied Piper has changed many landscapes.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:52.460]   Compression, data, the internet.
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.820]   Click below to look back at the evolution of Piedpupper.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:59.820]   Revolutionizing one landscape at a time.
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:01.100]   Year one.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.660]   This is great.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.180]   This is the Silicon Valley show.
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:06.620]   And where is Gavin?
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:07.500]   Don't be here.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.100]   This was what they were working on, right?
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.020]   It was a codec.
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:14.140]   So this is basically the website.
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:18.700]   I wonder if HBO did this, or is this a fan-made site?
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.540]   Home box office.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.300]   Copyright 2019.
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:23.020]   My Piedpupper.com.
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:23.820]   They got on that.
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:25.180]   Home box office.
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:29.820]   And here, finally, in year five, the internet we deserve.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.900]   So I do have a legitimate question.
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:34.140]   Do you think this Nvidia stuff could actually be useful
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:35.740]   for the Twit Network at some point?
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.340]   Well, yeah, when they leave,
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.820]   Jeff wants to be less pink.
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.700]   Nothing can help that.
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.380]   I want AI to make people human.
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.300]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:50.140]   What will happen is Zoom or somebody like Zoom
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.860]   will incorporate it into their engine.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:57.420]   And then, well, if somebody does, we'll--
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:01.100]   And so a fan's connection goes wonky.
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:02.700]   It'll prove it for us.
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:02.940]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:04.700]   Oh, no.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:05.420]   It's a lie.
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:06.300]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:06.940]   It's so wonky it leaves.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:07.340]   And no.
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:11.260]   I'm going to guess it's probably going to require an Nvidia
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.660]   graphics card to work.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:14.220]   I don't know.
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:14.860]   Get that covered.
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:16.220]   You got one.
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.460]   Well, so there's two ways Nvidia could win here.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.460]   One is the training.
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:22.460]   So it's like wants us to use AI.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:26.860]   And then the inference are the way that it's actually implemented on your machine
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.420]   may not require a graphics card.
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:30.060]   Right.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:30.780]   But I bet it does.
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:32.460]   So even if it doesn't.
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.420]   If I were them, I would.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.740]   And so we should just check in speaking of Zoom on Zootopia.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.260]   It's going on.
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.380]   We missed Mark Cuban.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:43.740]   Oh, God.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:45.340]   I do not miss Mark Cuban.
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:45.900]   Zootopia?
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:47.820]   Scroll down.
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:48.380]   You got the schedule.
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:50.140]   This is a live conference.
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:51.820]   Oh, boy.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:52.700]   It's the agenda.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:53.820]   Well, you got to sign in.
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:55.740]   I signed into Zoom with my Google account.
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:56.540]   And well, let me do that.
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:56.940]   So I--
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:57.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:57.980]   I need a Zoom account.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:27:59.340]   Keep going down.
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.500]   It was five o'clock Easter time.
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:02.460]   When's Kanye coming?
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:04.300]   He's going to be old because that's what I want to watch.
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.620]   Oh, boy.
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.140]   Exciting.
[01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:08.620]   Is it off?
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:09.580]   Are they going to have easy?
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:12.460]   They should not let him out right now.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:12.780]   I know.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:13.900]   He's actually doing it well.
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:14.620]   I don't think.
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.420]   There's Mark Cuban.
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:20.620]   It was a two celebration of happiness by Mark Cuban.
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.540]   Okay.
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.980]   Well, we've missed Zootopia.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:25.340]   Yeah, it's about it.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.220]   It's on for tomorrow, too.
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:27.980]   It's two days of Zoom, Topia.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:28.380]   Wow.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:29.980]   Wow.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.340]   Yeah, we should probably start thinking about
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.260]   maybe there's something better out there than Skype.
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:36.860]   We try other things all the time.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:39.340]   And Skype works for us.
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:41.100]   But I don't--
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:42.060]   Most of the time.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:42.540]   Most of the time.
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:45.340]   We're just not tied to it, but it happens to work.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:48.540]   So I'm always--
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:50.380]   If there's something better, I'm going to try it.
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:52.540]   What is the Gartner hype cycle, by the way?
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:53.580]   You had that video.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.340]   So it--
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:29:00.060]   If you search for Gartner hype cycle.
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:01.500]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.420]   You'll see the chart that they do.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:09.900]   And it has from under-appreciated to overhyped to disappoint--
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.500]   Oh, so it's the technology trigger.
[01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:12.620]   That's what gets going.
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:16.060]   Then it goes to the peak of inflated expectations.
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.300]   Then it comes down to the trough of disillusionment.
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:20.620]   Oh, I'm in the trough of disillusionment right now.
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.620]   Then it comes to the slope of enlightenment.
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:22.940]   Oh.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.300]   And then the plateau of productivity.
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:25.100]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:28.460]   So every year they place technologies on this.
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:33.180]   Ah, so where are we in the hype phase?
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:34.380]   It depends on the technology.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.740]   Each technology gets placed on that chart.
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:38.860]   I would assume.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:40.700]   So he took 25 years of trough.
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:45.100]   I think we're at the peak of inflated expectations in 5G, for sure.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.540]   This is good.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:47.180]   What's the question?
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:48.780]   So this is--
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:49.340]   Maybe.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:49.660]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.100]   Which means--
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:51.900]   I agree.
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:52.380]   --I agree.
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:56.060]   Which means we're just a few minutes away from the trough of disillusionment.
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.420]   Now you're seeing it go through the years.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:00.300]   This is actually quite--
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:01.740]   I think quite insightful.
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.820]   I don't know if everything follows this curve,
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.500]   but a lot of things do, for sure.
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:09.340]   You all have never heard of the Gartner Hype Cycle until this?
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:10.380]   No, ma'am.
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:10.940]   I'm ignorant.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:11.660]   OK.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:12.220]   It knows.
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:14.300]   I think it's a big enterprise software.
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:15.980]   Well, I don't know.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:17.180]   We talk about it all the time.
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:17.580]   So I'm like--
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:21.500]   So here's an example.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.700]   It's 2006.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:27.100]   Quantum computing and DNA logic are just getting started, right?
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:31.900]   Augmented reality, model-driven architectures, semantic web.
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:34.940]   Now, at the peak of the inflated expectations,
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:40.220]   digital paper and e-ink, grid computing, biometric payments--
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:42.140]   Is it now going down into the slew of--
[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:46.140]   In the slew of disillusionment, wikis, corporate blogging,
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:48.540]   mesh networks, sensors, tablet PCs?
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:50.940]   Some of these did make it out of the slew of despond
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:52.460]   into the slope of enlightenment.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.860]   Let's watch and see what happens.
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:59.580]   So this is one of the problems with this,
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:03.180]   is they can just take people off the graph if they were wrong.
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:05.740]   Well, it's not a lot of them were one year wonders.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.060]   Like the semantic web.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:08.940]   Look, ebook readers--
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.020]   Remember what we had to talk about ontologies all the time?
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.460]   Yeah, they disappeared.
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.540]   Biometric authentication, those get in there.
[01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:15.500]   Speech recognition.
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.420]   Is that the plateau?
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:19.180]   The slew is one time.
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:22.060]   Red is 10 or more times.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.260]   Augmented reality.
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:24.700]   AR stays on there forever.
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:25.420]   AR.
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:26.620]   But artificial--
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:29.100]   No, flying autonomous vehicle, right?
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:33.100]   You know, if you look at this, there's a lot of hype
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:36.780]   and very little actual success.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:37.340]   Well, there are things--
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:40.220]   I mean, like grid computing gradually became--
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:40.780]   Something else.
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:41.420]   Cloud computing.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:41.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:44.540]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:47.420]   I'm looking at the iPhone announcement
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:49.260]   and when the image showed up,
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.580]   the first thing that kind of my mind was the iPhone 4.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.060]   You know, it looks just like a design--
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:54.700]   The phone fact.
[01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:55.820]   But there's a reason for that.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:56.700]   It's the antennas.
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:01.260]   So this thing that kind of bugs me is so much energy,
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.940]   so much engineering effort,
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:05.180]   so much cost was devoted to this 5G.
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:07.740]   I guess Apple felt like, well, we've got to do it.
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:08.860]   It's now or never.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:09.340]   But it's--
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.620]   Well, they had to do it eventually.
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:11.020]   So--
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:12.460]   Eventually, for sure.
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.700]   But the question is, we're on the hype cycle.
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:15.500]   Are we on 5G?
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:16.700]   And I think it's early to be.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.500]   And it's annoying because we're going to bear the brunt.
[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.020]   Who pays for all of that innovation?
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:24.380]   Well, we don't have to buy this phone.
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.420]   I do, unfortunately.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.940]   Okay.
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:28.780]   Then you have to pay for it.
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:30.220]   Which one in the world would be like, eh.
[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:31.900]   Oh, I'm going to get the most expensive phone.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.260]   Or shoot something with it.
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:33.580]   I will.
[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:34.460]   I'll let you borrow it.
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:34.940]   You bet.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.700]   I think I'm going to get my mom's--
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.060]   Yours is the review I hear about.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:44.300]   One of my chopped liver?
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:46.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:47.500]   Thank you.
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.340]   I want the photo snob view of this.
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:50.300]   I'm good on a cracker.
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:52.300]   I want her to push a couple of breaks.
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:52.620]   Okay.
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:57.100]   Oh, I should do another ad.
[01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.380]   That's what I should do right now.
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:32:59.980]   That would be a good thing to do.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.100]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:02.700]   And Stacey had some things that she wanted.
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.660]   I'm going to let Stacey.
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:06.220]   We did Jeff's things, such as they were.
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:06.860]   Now it's your turn.
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:08.060]   You were so excited with them.
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:10.060]   I know you have to rest now.
[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.700]   I must rest and talk about Zipperkruiter.
[01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:16.780]   Which is actually something I'm getting pretty hyped up about.
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:18.540]   Because what's good news is,
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.780]   people are actually starting to go back to work.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.140]   Hiring is starting to pick up.
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:25.260]   There are a lot of people looking.
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.660]   And if you're one of those people hiring,
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:28.700]   God bless you.
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.580]   Thank you.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:30.700]   Congratulations.
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:31.740]   You're on the upswing.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:36.620]   But there's a lot to think about as you're in this process.
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:39.340]   Especially when you have to think about enforcing social distancing
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:42.060]   and supplying masks and so forth.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:43.660]   I'm going to make your job simpler,
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.220]   at least when it comes to hiring the right people fast.
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.500]   Zip recruiter.
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.340]   It's kind of an amazing technology.
[01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:49.900]   The first thing,
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.540]   when you post your job on Zipperkruiter,
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:56.140]   it sends it to over 100 of the web's leading job sites.
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:59.020]   So you cast the widest possible net.
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:02.540]   More people will see your opening than anything else.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:05.820]   And that's really important because the right person is out there.
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:07.260]   You just got to find out where they are.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.940]   You're going to reach them where they live.
[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:12.220]   But then Zip recruiter does something pretty amazing.
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:14.860]   They have powerful matching technology.
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:17.340]   So they scan all the resumes they have on tap.
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:19.260]   Lots of people come to Zipperkruiter looking for work.
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:22.540]   So they can go through those resumes automatically.
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:26.540]   Find people who have the right experience for your opening
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:28.620]   and then invite them to apply to your job.
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:36.700]   The option of all of this is you're going to get qualified candidates very, very quickly.
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:37.420]   Don't worry.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:39.180]   They're not going to come to your phone.
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:41.500]   They're not going to be calling you at home.
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.460]   They're not going to be filling your inbox with applications.
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:47.180]   Because it all goes into the Zip recruiter interface.
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:49.820]   Where they format the resumes, make it easy to scan them.
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:53.260]   They give you features like screening questions to filter candidates.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:57.660]   There's a complete dashboard, which makes it very easy to review the candidates,
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:01.020]   rank them, and pick the right person fast.
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:02.460]   That's what Monica Starks did.
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:07.260]   She was hiring at her construction company GS Group,
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:11.740]   having a hard time finding the right person because there were so many candidates out there.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.180]   And it's like a needle in a haystack.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:19.260]   That's actually why she switched to Zip recruiter because they make hiring easy.
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:22.780]   This is one of the hiring stories you'll find at ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:24.860]   It worked really well.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:31.100]   Lamont Jenkins profile was sent to her five minutes after she posted her job.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.980]   Because Zip recruiter went through their resumes and said,
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:38.060]   "Oh, Lamont's perfect for this," and sent his application on.
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:38.780]   We're actually here.
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.380]   They invited him to apply.
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.900]   He said, "Yes, I'd like to apply."
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:43.180]   And then they sent it on.
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:44.700]   And that is key.
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:50.940]   We've had that same experience where Lisa would post for an opening at breakfast by lunch.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:52.860]   We had two or three really good candidates.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:55.820]   In fact, Zip recruiter is so effective.
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:36:00.460]   Four out of five employers who post on Zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day.
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:01.580]   Sometimes a lot faster.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:02.780]   It's really amazing.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:03.500]   See for yourself.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.260]   You can try it for free right now.
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:13.900]   ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:17.180]   It's the smartest way to hire.
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:21.100]   And we are devoted Zip recruiter fans here to it.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.020]   ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:25.020]   Okay.
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:26.780]   Stacey, is there any kitchen tech?
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.540]   Any network tech?
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:31.180]   Any IoT tech that you're excited about?
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:33.980]   Are we doing the end of the show, Raph?
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:34.780]   Is that what's happening?
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:35.420]   No.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.940]   It's a chance for you to pick a story that you care about.
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:42.620]   Oh, you know, I picked a story where to go.
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:43.820]   It's in the Google section.
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:45.420]   So y'all are going to be extra excited.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.460]   Oh, so exciting.
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:51.420]   Google police search, which is a terrible that I just didn't want to cut and paste.
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:54.780]   But Google is giving data to police based on search keywords.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:55.340]   Oh, crap.
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:37:00.940]   So this, though, is interesting because they're not doing it on the individual level.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:03.500]   Now, police are asking, they're issuing warrants.
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:11.420]   Say, where they ask Google to disclose everyone who has searched for a particular keyword.
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:14.780]   So like fertilizer bomb or something?
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:15.740]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:19.100]   So it's the inverse of like, I suspect Stacey,
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.100]   let's see what she searched for.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:22.460]   But like, let's say they think.
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.700]   Yeah, but this is a fishing expedition.
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:27.420]   So yeah, librarians refuse to do.
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:31.260]   So that, well, they're asking for it.
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:33.260]   And they're getting it apparently.
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:38.060]   So for instance, they have an example in this CNET article.
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:45.820]   They, the police in Florida sent a search warrant to Google.
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:53.580]   It said, we want to see users who had searched for a particular address near where an arson happened.
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:56.460]   So somebody typed in an address and they got back.
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.060]   Everybody who searched for that address.
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:00.540]   Now, I don't know.
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.940]   I feels like to me that's, that would have pulled in a lot of innocent people.
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:06.620]   In fact, mostly innocent people.
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:11.100]   They did in fact arrest somebody for setting fire to a witness's car.
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:14.860]   I don't know if I like that, but.
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:20.300]   If they had a librarian working for them, the librarian told them, you don't do that.
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:24.220]   You can't go to the library and say, hey, can you tell me everybody who used your computers
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:26.060]   and searched for fertilizer bomb?
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:27.020]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:30.060]   Maybe they can now though.
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.460]   That's the point.
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:39.180]   But what I found interesting is that in New York, they've actually proposed legislation to make
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:39.820]   this illegal.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:41.020]   So I'm like, go to York.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:42.380]   I mean, obviously it's not passed.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:46.140]   And we're probably going to see some state by state.
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:51.900]   And not enforcement rules around this, which could be confusing.
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.380]   And then maybe Google will be like, ah, dang it.
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:56.620]   Let's figure out something we can do federally.
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:03.820]   Credit to reporter for Detroit News, Robert Snell, who found the unsealed court filing on
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:05.980]   Tuesday and tweeted about it.
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:12.060]   Google provided the IP addresses of people who searched for the arson victim's address.
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:19.260]   They then tied one of the IP addresses to a phone number belonging to the suspect.
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:24.620]   And he then used phone number records to pinpoint the location of his device using,
[01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:28.940]   I guess one of those pen warrants where he could say, hey, where was this guy on the night of?
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:32.620]   And they did use this to like get a person.
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:33.500]   Hey, arrested him.
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:34.220]   Yep.
[01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:39.180]   So this is this is very much, you know, his digital footprint getting him in trouble.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.820]   I mean, actually, let me let me revisit arson got him in trouble.
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.820]   But he got caught because of his digital footprint.
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:53.580]   Google has declined to say how many key word warrants they've received in the past three years.
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:59.180]   But they did say that they work to protect the privacy of their users, but they have to support
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:39:59.820]   law enforcement.
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:03.500]   Quote, this is Google's director of law enforcement and information security, Richard
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:04.460]   Salkato.
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:08.940]   We require a warrant and push to narrow the scope of these particular demands
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:14.300]   when overly broad, including by objecting in court, objecting in court, when appropriate,
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:19.580]   these data demands represent less than 1% of total warrants and a small fraction
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:22.940]   of the overall legal demands for user data that we currently receive.
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:25.980]   That's a really interesting policing technique.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:28.140]   I'm not necessarily against it.
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:30.540]   I mean, they caught the guy.
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:36.540]   But I mean, the question then becomes like how broad could those so searching for that particular
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:37.580]   person's address?
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:40.860]   I can imagine that's a pretty narrow search, right?
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:42.060]   Well, it doesn't have to be.
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.260]   Let's say I'm throwing.
[01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:47.420]   I mean, it's COVID, but let's say I was throwing a party and lots of people were searching for my
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:47.900]   address.
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:50.540]   I mean, yes, they could argue.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:51.900]   Well, she was throwing a party.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:57.660]   I wanted to figure out and that would presumably absolve them, but I don't know.
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:01.660]   And sometimes I search for addresses like when we were buying a house, I was searching for
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:03.900]   addresses all the time so I could see the house on Street View.
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:05.260]   I don't know.
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:10.380]   I mean, it's not, it depends on the search.
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:17.980]   It depends on and any time you get caught up in one of these, what I guess the thing to ask is
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:22.700]   if you get caught up in something like this, what happens to you as a citizen?
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:25.900]   What does the burden put upon you to prove your innocence?
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:26.380]   Right.
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:30.940]   Because make no mistake that you are proving your innocence in this case.
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:32.220]   So do you have to hire a lawyer?
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:35.900]   Because it's a pretty high thing, high hurdle to jump over.
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:40.300]   And so I think we should ask ourselves things like that when we're trying to figure out if
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.180]   this is good or not.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:46.780]   Well, I would say in a case like this where it's a very specific search and probably came up with
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:52.140]   one or maybe a couple of people searching for that address.
[01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:53.820]   That's a very specific search.
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:57.580]   And that's more useful to the police.
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:01.980]   They could probably eliminate some of the people by saying, well, that's the guy who lives there.
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:03.180]   That's a friend who came over.
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:04.860]   But who's this?
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:10.140]   And that doesn't mean that they necessarily banged on every door and with a warrant and said,
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:11.980]   we're taking you downtown for questioning.
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:15.900]   It's part of an overall picture that they're painting.
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:19.580]   I have a little less problem with that than if they search for fertilizer bomb,
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:25.100]   which might produce an eighth grader as well as a bad guy.
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:27.500]   The more narrow I think the better.
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:27.820]   Right?
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:28.940]   Would you agree with that, Stacey?
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:29.500]   That is true.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:36.460]   And as someone who is, I have Googled various money laundering techniques that I learn about on books or
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:37.740]   television, I'm like, is that real?
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:38.540]   Let's see.
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:40.860]   I'm like, yes.
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:42.780]   I googled crimes all the time.
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.300]   Doesn't mean I'm going to commit them.
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.340]   I just don't want my search to make me guilty.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:47.580]   Right.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:48.940]   Because I'm searching for something.
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:49.180]   Right.
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:53.180]   Anyway, I thought y'all'd appreciate that story.
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:53.660]   No, I do.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:54.300]   Yep.
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:57.340]   EFF surveillance litigation director Jennifer Lynch said,
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:02.380]   if Google stored data in a way that was truly identified, de-identified,
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:05.900]   they couldn't do these kinds of--
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:09.260]   And I wrote about that.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:13.580]   I think that story is out now, but I wrote about that for IEEE, my column and that.
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:16.620]   And that was all about privacy by design.
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:23.740]   And basically, if you're going to gather lots of potentially intrusive data,
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:30.620]   you must separate it completely from identifying characteristics.
[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:32.300]   So Google does not do that.
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:35.740]   But somebody like DuckDuckGo, that's their selling point.
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:35.980]   Right.
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:37.020]   We de-identify.
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.300]   We don't know who you are.
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:40.140]   I hope that's true.
[01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:44.300]   Is that where you're doing your fertilizer bomb searches?
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:49.900]   It's more like weird sexual practices, but I'm not--
[01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:50.860]   don't be judging me.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:57.180]   But no, seriously, I think that that would be a very good argument for not using Google for searches,
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.340]   but instead using something that--
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:02.700]   Anana, that doesn't mean that they don't have to work well,
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:05.260]   but why are they tracking who searches for what?
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.100]   Why are they keeping that information?
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:09.100]   Well, obviously, they're keeping it so they can--
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:11.100]   ads for ads, right?
[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:12.780]   The better to serve you ads.
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:13.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:19.020]   So that's a very good argument for DuckDuckGo, for instance.
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:20.220]   Or incognito mode.
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.980]   Just throwing it out there.
[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:22.620]   Oh, no.
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:24.140]   That's, by the way, no.
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:28.140]   Incognito mode does not hide you from Google.
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:32.620]   It only doesn't save cookies on your browser.
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:34.700]   Google still knows who made this search.
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:36.860]   It still ties your IP address to that search.
[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:39.580]   There's a public service for everybody.
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:39.900]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:43.660]   Incognito mode does not protect your privacy that way.
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:45.820]   I honestly think that that's--
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:50.060]   now that you mentioned this, this is a very strong case for--
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:52.460]   I've kind of been looking for something beyond--
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:55.660]   I don't care if these targets add against me.
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:57.500]   That's actually a benefit to me.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:00.140]   But if that data is also used, for instance,
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:04.620]   in a fishing warrant by law enforcement,
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:07.500]   I-- that's problematic, don't you think?
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.300]   And if he--
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:10.060]   And if he want to tell us about Leon?
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:10.780]   No.
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:17.500]   That is, by the way, why many browsers, Firefox offers this,
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:18.300]   allow you to do--
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:22.460]   Well, actually, this wouldn't protect you.
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.340]   Would DNS over HTTPS?
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:26.860]   No, it wouldn't protect you.
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:28.460]   Because you're going to Google and saying,
[01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:29.420]   tell me something.
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:31.020]   Google knows your IP address.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:32.380]   A VPN would protect you?
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:33.660]   Yes, it would anonymize you.
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.580]   That's a good reason to use a VPN.
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:41.580]   The IP address associated with that would be the VPN's not yours.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:45.100]   Again, why it's very important to choose a VPN that does not log.
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:45.980]   Does it log?
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:47.740]   If you could go to the VPN and say,
[01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:49.260]   hey, who was making that search?
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:51.820]   And they could say, well, Leo was using that IP address at that time.
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:53.340]   That would not be good.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:56.140]   I'm not trying to undermine police.
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:00.460]   This looks like an interesting investigative tool.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:04.380]   I worry about overly broad fishing searches.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:05.660]   So good.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:06.780]   Yeah, really good story.
[01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:08.460]   Can I bring one up?
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:09.740]   No.
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:13.180]   Well, Jeff, you may say no.
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:13.660]   What about ask?
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:17.900]   What about 26 and 35?
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.420]   It seems like those two--
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.380]   20, 35.
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:21.420]   It's 35.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.460]   It's 35.
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:25.100]   So this-- I did see this in the Times the other day.
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:28.140]   Google employees encourage to speak up,
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:32.620]   except if they're saying something about antitrust,
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.900]   then we don't like that so much.
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:35.900]   This is from the New York Times.
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:36.940]   What's the data on that story?
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:37.900]   Because it's been around for--
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:39.100]   October 13th.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:40.300]   So it's a recent--
[01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:42.060]   A, that well, it's not.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:45.260]   It's been around B, when I worked for companies,
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:47.020]   we were told-- when I worked for media companies,
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:47.980]   we were told the same thing.
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:50.220]   I was given very strict instructions,
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:52.620]   words not to use.
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.860]   Do you never use the word dominate?
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.700]   Yeah, and think about it.
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:57.260]   Uh-oh.
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:00.940]   Uh, all internal email is property of the company
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:05.740]   and is subject to warrant and search and subpoena.
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:06.380]   Discovery.
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:07.500]   So a discovery.
[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:09.820]   So I think that that's not unreasonable, actually, to say--
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.180]   It's not unreasonable in the least.
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:11.820]   Yeah.
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:15.020]   You may not have these discussions on our network.
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:16.540]   You're using a corporate resource.
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:18.300]   We ask that you not do that.
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:21.100]   OK.
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:21.900]   A key there.
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:23.260]   That's something that just--
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:24.060]   Good answer.
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:26.860]   A lot of people going in when they go--
[01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:29.500]   when they take these positions or roles or whatever,
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.260]   it seems like most people don't read
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:33.420]   the handbooks because most of the time,
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:34.860]   that's right there in their handbook
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:36.060]   when they sign up for the gig.
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:36.540]   Exactly.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.620]   And we put that in your handbook, can't remember.
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:39.100]   Sure did.
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:40.780]   No antitrust talk.
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:43.260]   Because Leo is a monopoly.
[01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:44.620]   Nobody else does this show.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:47.580]   We are the only one on Earth.
[01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:48.140]   This is a--
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.340]   Twig is a monopoly.
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:50.940]   Who else would talk for three hours?
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:51.740]   Not about Google.
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:52.940]   We actually--
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:53.180]   For us.
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:54.060]   We actually don't--
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.180]   We don't talk Google today.
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:56.140]   We don't crushed it.
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:57.580]   We don't write our own handbook.
[01:47:57.580 --> 01:47:58.060]   We--
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:47:58.940]   ADP does.
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.780]   Because we have a source of HR.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:02.700]   So it's very possible there is stuff in there
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:04.700]   that's a boilerplate that like,
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:06.540]   "Well, one of the things you don't want to talk about."
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:09.260]   Leo's hair loss.
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:11.020]   You should probably have someone read that.
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:12.940]   No, somebody reads it.
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:13.580]   Just not me.
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:14.060]   It's right.
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:14.540]   Okay.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:15.740]   It's right.
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:17.900]   No, the employees have to read it.
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.580]   Well, they don't have to.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:20.700]   Nobody's watching over it.
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:21.260]   Yeah, you should.
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:23.500]   Yeah, you sign up thing that says you read it.
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:23.980]   That's right.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.020]   Read your handbook.
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:25.820]   If you have to sign it.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:27.020]   I'm sure Lisa's read it.
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:28.780]   But I have to say,
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:30.780]   I'm not an employee, so I have to write it.
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:35.740]   I probably should read it, shouldn't I?
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:36.620]   For shame.
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:38.620]   So what was your story?
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.260]   The--
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:39.900]   What was your story?
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:40.540]   I was writing it.
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:41.260]   And another one.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:41.740]   Yeah.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:42.380]   Oh, and another one.
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:43.820]   Oh, is this Google Contractors?
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:45.740]   Say their work is being shipped to Poland?
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:47.900]   Right.
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:48.380]   Yeah.
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:50.540]   After they started talking about unionize,
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:51.500]   and I'm like,
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.780]   "Why is that news?"
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:55.260]   Because it just sounds like Google doesn't want to work with you.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.940]   Well, but it isn't Google.
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:57.820]   It's a contractor.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:59.020]   That's the part of it.
[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:00.780]   So this isn't actually done by Google.
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:02.380]   It's done by HCL America.
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:06.460]   80 contractors employed by HCL America
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:09.900]   voted to unionize with US steelworkers,
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:14.300]   which is according to Vice and Historic Victory
[01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:16.220]   for white-collar tech workers in the US.
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:21.020]   But the NLRB issued a formal complaint against HCL,
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:23.900]   alleging the company violated labor law
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:26.860]   by failing to bargain with the steelworkers union.
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:30.540]   Now, and then basically firing the workers
[01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:36.140]   and having the work be done by non-union members
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:38.300]   in a crack-out poll facility.
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:39.100]   It's a skip.
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:41.500]   They don't work directly for Google,
[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:45.260]   but this is, by the way, another little scam that companies do.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:48.780]   They use contractors so that they are kind of off the hook.
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:49.820]   Have some whittle.
[01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:54.860]   A lot of big tech companies, almost all of them I know of,
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:57.740]   use contractors.
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:01.980]   So it just makes it easier for you.
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:06.140]   Not just with unionization, but things like benefits.
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:06.620]   Benefits.
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:07.100]   Yeah.
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.260]   I read that and again, I just thought,
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:11.980]   didn't they realize they were contractors?
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:15.260]   So there's going to be some rules of engagement
[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:16.860]   that's just not going to apply to them
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.020]   because they're not hired employees.
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:21.340]   They're hired independent contractors.
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:29.260]   So it sounds like HCL engaged in kind of a common union busting actions.
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:32.060]   The NLRB, which is responsible for enforcing this,
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:34.380]   has scheduled a hearing for February
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:39.020]   when it will prosecute HCL for violating the National Labor Relations Act.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:44.300]   So it doesn't directly reflect on Google,
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:45.900]   but it's sort of indirectly.
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:50.700]   These contractors work as many of them,
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:53.100]   not all of them work as analysts on Google shopping.
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:58.860]   Again, not an uncommon practice.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:01.660]   I see it happening all the time.
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:04.060]   It's working a different to work on a certain project
[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:05.180]   in a certain department.
[01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:06.300]   You see it all the time.
[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:09.740]   My story was a New Yorker story.
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:12.940]   I'm sure you read because you read a cover to cover, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:17.420]   Well, actually, no, I limit how many, I got a month,
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:19.580]   so I chose not to read this one.
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:22.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:25.660]   I'll read it in like three weeks when I get around to that issue.
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:26.380]   Yeah, I know.
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:29.420]   This came out in the October 9th issue,
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:30.540]   since the newest New Yorker.
[01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:33.900]   Why Facebook can't fix itself?
[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:37.420]   Andrew Moore wasn't going to use one of my three clicks on this.
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:39.020]   I just said, nope, not doing it.
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:40.620]   Well, maybe you should be into it.
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:41.420]   Maybe you should.
[01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:41.420]   Maybe you should.
[01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:43.980]   Just open your eyes to what's going on, my friend.
[01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:45.580]   I say this.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:47.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.500]   This is where Anton and I go do something else.
[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:53.340]   We should have the Stacy Inn so far.
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.420]   The weekly fisticuffs between Jeff and--
[01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:56.060]   Hold on a second.
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:57.180]   I've got to get something.
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:57.980]   Oh, crap.
[01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:02.460]   All right, I guess there's nothing more to say about it.
[01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:04.540]   The issue really is--
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:05.980]   Jeff just went to get his--
[01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:07.660]   I'm betting it's the moral panic bulletin.
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:08.300]   Oh, it is.
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:10.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:11.260]   Here's the quote.
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:16.860]   In retrospect, and he has a lot of establishing facts, of course,
[01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:19.660]   it seems the company Facebook's strategy has never been
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:23.020]   to manage the problem of dangerous content,
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:26.540]   but to manage the public's perception of the problem.
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:30.620]   That'll stop right there.
[01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:33.020]   The whole concept of dangerous content
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:36.940]   should be kind of offensive to a journalist.
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:41.340]   That content, that speech can be dangerous.
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:43.100]   Is, I would say--
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:44.460]   No, this speech can be dangerous.
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:46.700]   We can say, yelling fire in a crowded theater,
[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:47.500]   right?
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:47.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:51.980]   But focusing people to violently liberate Michigan
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:52.460]   could lead to--
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:52.940]   Facebook.
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:54.140]   --to kidnap the governor.
[01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:59.900]   Facebook routinely removes ISIS recruitment propaganda,
[01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:03.660]   but it's been far less aggressive in cracking down
[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:05.020]   on white supremacist groups.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:08.460]   So they do, in fact, police it.
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:10.860]   The point is that it's--
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:11.340]   Here's--
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:11.900]   Here's--
[01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:12.780]   As is they're right.
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:13.260]   Here's--
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:13.900]   As is they're right.
[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:15.420]   No, I'm not saying they're doing anything illegal.
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:16.460]   Um--
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:21.260]   They refer to Nick Clegg, who wrote the Facebook,
[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:22.220]   who's there now in--
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:24.700]   You know, what is he, the head of communications.
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:27.900]   He wrote the Facebook takes a zero tolerance approach
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:29.020]   to hate speech, but--
[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:32.380]   But with so much content posted every day,
[01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:36.060]   rooting out the hate is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:39.260]   Uh, the author continues.
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:40.620]   The metaphor, Cass Zuckerberg,
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:43.100]   is a hapless victim of fate day after day
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:44.540]   through no fault of his own.
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:47.820]   His haystack ends up mysteriously full of needles.
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:51.740]   A more honest metaphor would posit a powerful set of magnets
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:54.460]   at the center of the haystack, Facebook's algorithms.
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.740]   I think this is true,
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:59.340]   which attract and elevate whatever content is most highly charged.
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:01.820]   And I need yours.
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:02.380]   Yours is better.
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:03.020]   I need yours.
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:04.060]   This is how the system--
[01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:06.860]   Do you deny that that's how the system is designed to work?
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:08.140]   That's what the algorithm does?
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:11.020]   I don't think it's what it does.
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:15.660]   I don't see a Nazi insight.
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:16.220]   And this--
[01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:18.940]   How I see no data, we can't get it out of them,
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:19.740]   which is part of the problem.
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:21.260]   They should be more transparent about this,
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:24.060]   of how many Nazis there are and how many people see them.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:27.900]   So Facebook's claim is, yes, we don't allow it,
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:30.780]   but it's so impossible for us to stop it
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:32.300]   that we do the best we can.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:33.340]   But it's--
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:38.060]   So I think it was my friend Ben Evans who went after Borat today,
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.500]   because Borat was screaming about this.
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:44.380]   And he said, "You who traffic in satire should know how difficult it is
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:47.180]   then to tell the difference between satire and real."
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.700]   And it is not easy.
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:50.540]   So Facebook should--
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:51.420]   What should Facebook do?
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.420]   They should just continue to do what they're doing?
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:55.980]   No, I think Facebook should do a lot more,
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:57.740]   but I don't think they should do it on the government pressure.
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:54:58.620]   Well, I'm not--
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:54:59.100]   And today, you have--
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:54:59.580]   This is the government.
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:00.700]   It's the freaking New Yorker.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:02.700]   Well, but it's worth it, hell.
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:04.860]   And today, you have the case today.
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:06.940]   Just today, you have the case where Facebook and Twitter
[01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:09.100]   decided not to promote and please let's not
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:10.060]   add anything to this.
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:13.260]   A really awful New York Times--
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:14.780]   I mean, New York Post story.
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:15.340]   I saw that.
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:15.980]   And then you have--
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:16.540]   I saw that.
[01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:16.940]   I saw that.
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:21.740]   You know, Senator of the United States screaming that this is Facebook,
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:23.660]   another public official screaming,
[01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:26.540]   "You're using the public airwaves as in--
[01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:26.860]   What?
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:28.060]   --ours and Wi-Fi,
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:31.020]   and we're going to force you to put this back up."
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:34.380]   And compelled speech is not free speech.
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:35.900]   And that's where this goes.
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:36.700]   That's my problem.
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:41.180]   So yes, I think Facebook should have a better rule set
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:43.180]   for how they run their garden party.
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:45.420]   Yes, they should have a North Star.
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:47.740]   They should decide that things just aren't appropriate there.
[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:49.820]   And for whatever reason, they decide it's not appropriate.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:50.540]   And it's our party.
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:51.340]   So screw you.
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:52.220]   We're taking this down.
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:54.780]   I think they should do a lot more of that on their own.
[01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:56.780]   But they should not do it under pressure
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:56:01.340]   from government and media pressuring government
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:04.140]   unaware of what they're doing around--
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:05.660]   No, I agree with the expression.
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:05.980]   All right.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:07.180]   Yeah.
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:08.140]   I actually--
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:10.140]   I should go to the end of this thing
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:11.740]   and see what his prescription is,
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:14.060]   because I didn't get that far.
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:15.660]   Probably to subscribe to magazines.
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:25.500]   He does say these restrictions are likely to feed into the notion
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:28.860]   that social media discriminates against conservatives.
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:30.460]   Duh-duh-duh-duh, exactly.
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:32.140]   He says become a right-wing talking point,
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:34.780]   although the bulk of evidence suggests the opposite.
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:41.100]   He refers to, as you have Kevin Russe's top 10 link posts,
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:44.460]   almost always dominated by far-right celebrities or news outlets.
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:45.500]   Stop right there for a second.
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.020]   As Facebook--
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:49.500]   He uses Facebook data from a Facebook company they bought,
[01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:51.340]   which is a Facebook problem.
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:53.100]   But as Facebook's people have pointed out,
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:55.020]   what's BS about that--
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.540]   And I've written about this too.
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:58.780]   All trending things, Twitter trending too.
[01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:00.700]   The number of people who actually see that thing,
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:03.100]   which is supposed to number one new story on all Facebook--
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.820]   You would like this author, because he says exactly that.
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:09.580]   He says it would be much more appropriate to rank by reach
[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:11.180]   instead of interactions.
[01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:14.220]   But the problem is that information is sealed up inside Facebook,
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:17.180]   and they're not telling anybody what the reach of any post is.
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:20.780]   Maybe that would be a useful thing Facebook could do.
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:26.140]   Honestly, I understand why they don't want to give ammunition to their critics.
[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:29.340]   But if they don't give ammunition to their critics,
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:32.220]   they're going to get more critiques, not fewer.
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:35.420]   So this is where the regulatory--
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:39.740]   Transatlantic high-level working group on
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:42.140]   content moderation freedom expression, of which I was a part,
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:46.380]   and the report says that, yes, we need to get data about impact out of them,
[01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:48.940]   so the researchers can look at it and then come back and say,
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:50.380]   this is a problem or this is not.
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:56.380]   Yeah, this article, which I thought was quite well put together,
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:59.900]   does not-- Andrew Marantz does not call for any action at all.
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:03.020]   He's just simply setting the stage.
[01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:03.660]   I just want to use my click.
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.420]   Setting the stage. You don't have to use your click.
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:08.620]   I've now told you everything that's in this 5,000 word.
[01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:11.020]   In about four weeks, Stacey can tell me what it says too.
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:12.060]   It's a lot of nice.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:12.780]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:19.020]   Although, I got to point out Clarence Thomas wants to reel in section 230.
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:19.740]   Oh, F.B.
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:25.820]   He is a-- he is a, I believe, a justice in the United States Supreme Court.
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:31.500]   He says, this was--
[01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:38.220]   this was-- he wrote about section 230 in a filing following the court's decision
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:41.580]   not to hear section 230 related case.
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:45.500]   He said his fellow justices were right to pass on the case,
[01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:50.540]   which centered on whether malware bites in an internet security company
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:55.020]   could be held liable for what Enigma software says was a wrongful designation
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:57.100]   of its products as malware, false positive.
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:59:01.420]   But he said the Supreme Court should welcome the chance
[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:06.700]   to scale back section 230 from the bench through a different case,
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:12.140]   extending 230 immunity beyond the natural reading of the text can have serious consequences,
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:12.860]   Thomas wrote.
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:18.780]   When the right case comes before us, it would behoove the justices.
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:21.100]   What-- where is-- where part of the country is he from now?
[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:25.260]   It would behoove the judge, my fourth grade teacher, I believe.
[01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:27.660]   behoove the justices to consider--
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:29.980]   behoove you to sit down, Leo Laporte.
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:30.940]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:31.340]   And be quiet.
[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:32.700]   Yeah, behoove you to shut up.
[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:35.820]   Someday people will pay to hear you talk all the time, but not my thoughts.
[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:40.460]   To consider a-- see, I told you-- I told you they would let me talk--
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:44.700]   would behoove the justices to consider a narrower reading of the law.
[01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:47.340]   He says internet companies have been granted sweeping protection,
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:52.060]   and the courts are reading more comprehensive immunity into section 230 than it was intended.
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:56.540]   It's not exactly-- let's overturn it.
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:57.740]   But it is interesting.
[01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:01.100]   He's saying the court could have something to say about section 230,
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:04.860]   as well as you know, I think there are six bills in front of Congress--
[02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:05.420]   Oh, it's--
[02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:07.180]   Eliminating section 230.
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:08.700]   That's not ridiculous.
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:10.460]   All right, I think--
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:14.780]   From all here, are we hit everything?
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:16.700]   I think anything that I missed--
[02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:19.420]   I think this is just amusing.
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:22.540]   The WordPress is going to let you turn a blog post into a Twitter thread.
[02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:23.340]   No!
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:24.140]   That was nice.
[02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:26.460]   No, it's between the inverse--
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:26.540]   Did they already do that?
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:27.580]   Oh, no, that was a plug.
[02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:29.340]   If you turn a Twitter thread into a blog post--
[02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:30.300]   You turn a Twitter thread into a blog post.
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:30.940]   As it should--
[02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:31.900]   For what it is.
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:33.100]   Oh, OK, I'm OK with that.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:33.820]   I'm good with that.
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:34.380]   OK, thank you.
[02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:34.860]   Yeah, sure.
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.220]   In fact, that's a nice feature.
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:37.180]   I like that.
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:37.980]   I will say that--
[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.460]   Sorry.
[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:42.860]   --I understand why people write blog posts at 140 characters at a time.
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:43.820]   It just doesn't--
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:45.660]   Well, that's how they're thinking.
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:49.500]   Jeff, I shared in line 93 something for you that I just thought was very amusing,
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:51.260]   and you can share it with your students, if you'd like.
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:53.580]   Well, now I'm just--
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:56.140]   Or not into the meme woods.
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:59.660]   Every journalist falls into one of these categories
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:01.500]   when writing or researching a story.
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:02.060]   Oh, I'm pretty confused.
[02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:02.620]   Lawful good--
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:03.820]   No, good chaotic good.
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:05.980]   I'm either chaotic good or chaotic evil,
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:07.420]   depending on how much time I have.
[02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:10.460]   Chaotic evil writes directly into the CMS.
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:12.620]   That's why I know it's stupid.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:16.780]   Lawful good has an alphabetical digital filing system
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:19.660]   of color-coded folders, docs, and spreadsheets for--
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:20.700]   I hate that person.
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:21.980]   I hate that person.
[02:01:21.980 --> 02:01:25.500]   Are you--
[02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:27.180]   So I used to write straight into Quark.
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:28.700]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.180]   Yes.
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:29.740]   That's like--
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:31.980]   Because then you could see your line breaks
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:32.300]   in a particular--
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:32.460]   Exactly.
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:33.660]   I would get rid of all the widows.
[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:35.340]   Pick a different word.
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:35.740]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:36.700]   No, I got--
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:38.620]   Well, you were writing for TV God,
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:41.260]   because I am, after all, a former TV God, TV critic.
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:43.580]   Digital tiny pages.
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:45.100]   Little tiny pages.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:45.500]   You had to--
[02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:47.340]   You had to worry about how things broke.
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:50.060]   Yeah, no, I mean, we had--
[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:55.340]   When I went to J School, Quark was our program of choice.
[02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:56.700]   Wow, man.
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:59.740]   Wow, Quark is a page layout program.
[02:01:59.740 --> 02:02:02.140]   So it's not quite writing into the CMS,
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:04.060]   because you don't have to publish button.
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:04.460]   But--
[02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:06.780]   No, I write into the CMS all the time.
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:07.820]   I write into WordPress.
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.580]   I used to write--
[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:10.220]   Why?
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:13.420]   --we had some custody for the papers,
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:15.980]   the deal, and I can't remember what it was,
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:17.980]   but I wrote directly into that sometimes too.
[02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:18.940]   Fucking.
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:21.260]   My wife, Leo, and her name, it weekly,
[02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:25.180]   my wife set up the entire publishing system for that.
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:29.260]   We were the first major magazine to go all Macintosh and all Quark.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:30.140]   Oh, wow.
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:31.100]   Is that how you met?
[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.420]   We met at Time Inc.
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:35.500]   And then when I did it, I said,
[02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:37.020]   "No, I don't trust anybody else to do this,
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:39.180]   and so they had to figure out how to have us work together."
[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:40.780]   You married a geek?
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:45.180]   No, she's a teacher.
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:45.980]   Oh, OK.
[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:47.660]   And she taught special ed,
[02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:50.220]   and that was the perfect qualification for teaching journalists how to--
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:51.180]   I want to curse your wife.
[02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:52.380]   That's actually true.
[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:53.660]   This is--
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:54.220]   Mm-hmm.
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:54.620]   --those.
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:03:03.500]   The CBS Interactive CMS burned me once too many times to write directly into it,
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:05.980]   so I stopped doing that long time ago.
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:06.460]   There's stuff.
[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:06.940]   Just--
[02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:09.100]   I go way back this time.
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:10.700]   I will do it as I'm writing.
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:12.060]   I'm like, this is a bad idea.
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:12.940]   This is a bad idea.
[02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:15.260]   And it dies.
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:17.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:18.380]   The worst billing.
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:20.460]   [GROANING]
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:20.780]   Same--
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:22.140]   I go so far back.
[02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:24.300]   Did I tell you the story about the Chicago Tribune CMS?
[02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:25.420]   Did I ever tell you the story or not?
[02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:26.060]   No, it was too many.
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:26.380]   I did.
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:29.580]   So we had--
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:31.180]   the first one was a scab system,
[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:33.260]   and I didn't realize that I trained the entire newsroom
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:35.100]   for the first time ever working on computers.
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:36.220]   This is a cursor.
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:38.860]   You have to have the cursor where you want to do something.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:39.420]   No, no, no.
[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:40.140]   Move the cursor.
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:41.580]   This is how you move the cursor.
[02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.460]   You can't just start that right.
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:43.660]   So I taught everybody that.
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:45.500]   Then they wanted a new system.
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:49.580]   And my job was to go and just brainstorm with the staff
[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:51.180]   and say, what kind of functions would you want?
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:53.100]   And then I left here in San Francisco.
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:55.260]   Well, they put every function that the staff wanted
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.220]   in the stupid system.
[02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:59.820]   There was a button that the copy editors wanted that if the
[02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:01.740]   writers said the first reference,
[02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:03.420]   US, when they should stay United States,
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:05.020]   it would explode it.
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:07.900]   If it was a second reference,
[02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:09.100]   the United States, it would shrink it.
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:09.260]   Right?
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:10.380]   They made a whole button just for that.
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:10.380]   Oh my god.
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:11.180]   Oh my god.
[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:11.820]   I love that.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:12.460]   I love that.
[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:15.020]   All these features and they had every feature in,
[02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:16.540]   but then the cost went so high.
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:18.620]   So they ended up cutting back on some stuff.
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:21.500]   And the paper didn't come out a couple days.
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:23.980]   And they they sicked their Pulitzer Prize
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:26.380]   winning investigative task force of reporters
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:28.220]   to investigate their own CMS.
[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:33.660]   And what had happened was they they cost cut
[02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:35.740]   and they took out memory and backup.
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:39.820]   We we didn't think you needed that save button.
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:40.940]   Yeah.
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:42.220]   So we just eliminated that.
[02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:44.380]   That's hysterical.
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:46.060]   All right.
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:49.180]   I think we should wrap this thing up
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:53.420]   and coming up, it's time for our picks of the week.
[02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:57.180]   And today I'm going to start with that
[02:04:57.180 --> 02:04:58.140]   because I always end with that.
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:04:59.500]   So I'm going to start with that.
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:00.300]   For picks of the week,
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:01.180]   your pick of the weekend.
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:02.620]   I have two.
[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:08.940]   One is OWCs SSDs because I've been trying to
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:11.980]   increase the storage on my home rig here.
[02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:14.300]   And of course, over time,
[02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:17.260]   you know, SSDs start to get a little bit slow.
[02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:19.740]   And this one, I've had it for a couple of weeks
[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:23.500]   and been throwing a couple lightroom catalogs at it
[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:27.100]   and even throwing proxy files and cache files
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:29.180]   to do some video processing.
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:33.260]   And it's been quite fast and it's so refreshing.
[02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:37.500]   I just hope that this will last for another six months or so.
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:41.420]   And I can still say this, but OWC claims it's not going to slow down,
[02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:43.100]   but we shall see.
[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:44.780]   But I wanted to give them a shout out.
[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:47.820]   OWC, Mercury, Stream, SSEs.
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:50.380]   That's so funny because I always think of them as a Mac.
[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:53.420]   Come on, either website is Macsales.com.
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:56.060]   You're using a Windows machine,
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:57.820]   which craps me in on a Windows machine.
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:06:00.940]   I just plugged it in to a setup port on my motherboard
[02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:02.860]   and been firing away with it.
[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:05.980]   And I also tried it out just as an external SSD.
[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:09.180]   I have an adapter and I plug it into the laptop via USB.
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:12.460]   But I get better speed, you know, plug it into the motherboard
[02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:15.180]   and do it my workflow that way.
[02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:16.620]   But I like the pricing on it.
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:21.420]   It's $120 for a 480 gig, I believe.
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:23.260]   Yeah, sounds right.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:25.100]   Yeah, I buy their stuff non-stop.
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:28.380]   Yeah, I said I'm not the most heavy OWC.
[02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:29.500]   It's actually working.
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:32.700]   Good. What else? You had two, I see.
[02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:33.100]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:37.340]   And the other one is it's called old pilot plane tails,
[02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:41.580]   but there's one in particular where he talked about,
[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:45.340]   this is an airline pilot, former airline pilot.
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:45.980]   And he talks about--
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:46.700]   This is a great podcast.
[02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:48.940]   Yeah, airlinepilotguy.com.
[02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:50.220]   It's a great airline pilot.
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:51.580]   I like it when you plug in.
[02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:51.820]   Yeah.
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:57.340]   But this particular episode, he talks about doing the public address
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:00.380]   as a pilot or as a flight attendant.
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:02.700]   And it's some pretty interesting tidbits in there.
[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:06.140]   As it made me think about even just doing podcasting,
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:09.020]   because if people watch Mr. Leo Laport,
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:11.180]   he says things are certain way,
[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:12.620]   and it just comes out a certain way
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:15.900]   to present a certain message in a certain feeling and emotion.
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:19.420]   And it's the same when it comes to doing the public address
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:21.020]   when you're 30,000 feet in the air,
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:22.700]   and you're trying to keep people comfortable,
[02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:24.540]   going across the ocean and things like that.
[02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:27.500]   It was pretty interesting, but at the end of that,
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:29.980]   it's a pretty funny story that I think you should check out.
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:31.420]   I will listen.
[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:39.180]   I'm kind of an aficionado of poor airline announcements.
[02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:41.580]   Yeah, because something like collect them.
[02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:42.140]   I don't want to hear.
[02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:46.460]   According to Thomas Wolfe,
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:49.340]   Tom Wolfe, not Thomas Wolfe, Tom Wolfe,
[02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:53.980]   in the right stuff, all airline pilots are basically emulating Chuck Yeager,
[02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:56.780]   because he had a Texas kind of twang,
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:57.740]   and he was very relaxed.
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:07:58.780]   Nope, wasn't Texas.
[02:07:58.780 --> 02:07:59.580]   It was West Virginia.
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:01.100]   My father went to high school with Chuck Yeager.
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:03.260]   Oh, my father went to high school with Chuck Yeager.
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:06.060]   And he had a certain way of talking, of course,
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:08.220]   because he has the exact same accent as pilots.
[02:08:08.220 --> 02:08:10.540]   Yeah, he was the great pilot, right?
[02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:13.740]   He was the original test pilot.
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:18.060]   Everybody, every pilot tried to sound like Chuck Yeager.
[02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:20.380]   Yeah, and he does, right?
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:21.180]   Isn't that right, Jeff?
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:22.700]   When you hear it, you hear Chuck Yeager?
[02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:23.020]   Yes.
[02:08:23.020 --> 02:08:23.740]   Oh, I hear it.
[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:24.140]   I hear it.
[02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:25.020]   I hear it by the father.
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:29.100]   We're flying at 30,000 feet, and it would be a bit of a raving in the...
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:32.300]   Yeah, they all sound like they came from Virginia.
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:32.860]   West Virginia.
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:33.340]   West Virginia.
[02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:34.380]   West Virginia.
[02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:36.540]   That's a unique accent.
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:37.500]   The West Virginia.
[02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:39.500]   There was a stat in there where he talked about,
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:45.420]   if you're flying over to Grand Canyon, some pilots would like to get into these long,
[02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:47.660]   so they'll squeeze about flying over to Grand Canyon.
[02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:48.860]   Oh, I hate when they talk so much.
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:54.780]   When they shouldn't do that, because only 10% of the aircraft can actually see it.
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:59.900]   So why do that to the other 90% of the people that pilots?
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:01.420]   It's bragging about what the pilot could see.
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:05.740]   Yeah, I wish you could see what I'm seeing up here in the front seat,
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:08.860]   but it is a beautiful view, ladies and gentlemen of Grand Canyon.
[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:10.460]   And we're going really fast.
[02:09:10.460 --> 02:09:13.500]   We're flying 60,000 feet right now.
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:17.180]   And yeah, yeah.
[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:21.260]   Chuck Yeager's still alive, 97 years old from Myra, West Virginia.
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:22.460]   Wow.
[02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:23.900]   That follows 94.
[02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:25.180]   There's a little behind them.
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:25.980]   Went to school with them.
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:26.460]   That's cool.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:33.420]   By the way, I just want to say Steve Martin has published his Halloween costume
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:36.620]   on his Twitter feed at Steve Martin to go.
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:37.660]   He's wearing it right now.
[02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:40.300]   It's a subtle costume.
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:47.020]   You might not immediately pick up on it, but there is a fly in his hair.
[02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:49.740]   Did you see the dingle in Cody Barrett?
[02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:51.260]   Also had a fly on her outfit?
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:52.380]   No, that's a story.
[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:53.020]   Yes.
[02:09:53.020 --> 02:09:54.380]   The same fly is going around.
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:54.780]   That fly.
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:55.340]   That's going around.
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:56.620]   It's going around.
[02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:59.180]   It's a certain late Supreme Court justice.
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:02.300]   Oh, you think it's Ruth?
[02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:03.580]   I think it's Ruth.
[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:05.260]   It's RBG flying around Pesteran.
[02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:06.940]   Oh, man.
[02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:09.100]   Stacy, what's your pick of the week?
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:10.940]   It's another, it's a the cooking thing, I think.
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:13.580]   Yeah, I decided to give you a cooking gadget.
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:14.060]   Thank you.
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:18.460]   This is the, this is the cheaper thermomics.
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.300]   It's a, it's a.
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:21.820]   Looks like an Instapot.
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:22.700]   It's an Instapot.
[02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:25.340]   It is like an Instapot, but it's, it's $200.
[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:31.580]   And it comes with recipes and much, it has a scale, much like your thermomics.
[02:10:31.580 --> 02:10:33.340]   I love that's by the way, the best feature.
[02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:36.300]   As you put stuff in and it weighs it, you don't have to weigh it separately.
[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:37.580]   I love that feature.
[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:39.260]   So you pick a recipe from the app.
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:46.060]   You, and then the app connects to the pot and it's like, all right,
[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:48.700]   you've chosen to make chicken and rice.
[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:49.580]   Cut your way of peppy.
[02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:50.940]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:52.300]   You can cut your way of peppy.
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:53.340]   We're not sure you're peppy.
[02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:57.660]   And so it told you to.
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:58.700]   I don't want the microwave.
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:01.580]   I cut the bag and I put it in and it's great.
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:02.540]   It's actually looks great.
[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:06.060]   So is it just a pressure cooker, does it brown or do anything else?
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:07.500]   It also has a saute function.
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:07.900]   Oh, nice.
[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:09.420]   Seems to be pretty good.
[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:11.420]   So it does, it does a lot of things.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:14.460]   You can make like traditional pressure cooker type foods,
[02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:16.700]   like beans and things like that, but you can also make pasta.
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:19.980]   And they've actually engineered things like the way they release
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:23.660]   the pressure to help ensure that things cook properly.
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:28.780]   This for people who are like, wow, the thermodynamics is really expensive.
[02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:30.220]   Nobody should have that thermomics.
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:31.900]   This doesn't have the chopping features that that does.
[02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:35.100]   But if you can prep your ingredients,
[02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:39.260]   basically it's like dump this in now and you dump it in.
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:40.300]   This looks right.
[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:43.340]   You can make it a charge in it.
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:44.940]   Well, the pudding, the custard.
[02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:46.460]   All the custard is nice.
[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:48.540]   You make the custard in something like this.
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:50.940]   And you can make, you can actually make a.
[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:51.260]   Double boy.
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:52.460]   We have to buy him about this.
[02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:55.260]   Yeah, you can make cheesecakes in it.
[02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:57.260]   You can make pasta.
[02:11:57.260 --> 02:12:00.460]   Anyway, I'm going to actually get a review unit.
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:02.460]   And I'm pretty excited about my.
[02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:03.420]   What's you're going to make first?
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:05.580]   Katia Pepe.
[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:07.580]   Katia Pepe.
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:08.380]   Katia Pepe.
[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:09.820]   It's calling.
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:10.460]   Nope.
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:14.620]   By the way, I don't know if we did the right thing for your pick.
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:18.060]   And I want to just tell people it's airlinepilotguy.com.
[02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:20.300]   And it's a September 19th show.
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:21.420]   It's not what you say.
[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:23.580]   So I want to make sure people could find that.
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:26.140]   It is what he says, but that's the title of the show.
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:28.380]   What you say is how you say it.
[02:12:28.380 --> 02:12:30.300]   I love it.
[02:12:30.300 --> 02:12:31.340]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:32.700]   I think you should do us a number.
[02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:33.820]   But now I know we tie one.
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:36.380]   Well, I will even though I already contributed one to the show.
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:36.700]   Yes.
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.060]   That's the kind of guy I am.
[02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:41.420]   I want to mention, by the way, that Ted Cruz just sent a letter to Jack Dorsey
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:44.220]   demanding, why did Twitter censor the New York Post?
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:48.140]   By that man, a constitution, a shorter include the right.
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:51.020]   Don't say you have something kind of more important going on.
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:55.340]   Then the post, which is not notoriously reliable.
[02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:59.580]   It's like saying, how dare you censor the national inquiry.
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:02.060]   And Rudy Giuliani is involved, but we're going to leave that aside.
[02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:03.180]   I don't want to get permission.
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:07.980]   So so Facebook just gave a $1 million donation to Bletchley Park.
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:08.780]   Oh, good.
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:10.620]   Yeah, it was better than you.
[02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:13.740]   Because of COVID to keep going over the hump here, which is nice.
[02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:16.620]   And then I also just want to mention a plug.
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:22.060]   My you were nice enough to put up the the tribute reel, but my scoop awards
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:27.740]   keynote, mere 24 minutes about the future of journalism and media and blowing it all up.
[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:31.820]   If you Google Jeff Jarvis scoop award, you'll find it under video tab.
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:33.180]   It's brief.
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:33.900]   It's in English.
[02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:36.780]   Here's what I found.
[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:37.900]   No, you didn't.
[02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:41.260]   Siri.
[02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:41.820]   I found it.
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:42.300]   You live.
[02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:43.100]   It's Siri.
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:45.900]   She always says, here's what I found on the web about that.
[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:46.860]   Nope.
[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:49.260]   Not going to do it.
[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:50.060]   I have something.
[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:53.420]   Now, Rick's poker coaching from Evan Jarvis.
[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:58.060]   Oh, that's interesting because that's my pick of the week is the John Hopkins.
[02:13:58.060 --> 02:14:01.500]   University poker course.
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.900]   It's an intercession course.
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:06.860]   So don't get all upset about the fact that this university is fine.
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:09.660]   University is teaching its children to play poker.
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:19.100]   But it is a course that has lectures, slides, video, materials, a PDF.
[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:20.540]   It's all free online.
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:23.900]   Hopkins poker course.com.
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:25.420]   I love the syllabus.
[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:27.420]   I think the syllabus kind of says it all.
[02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:32.780]   This intercession course aims to take students from novices who may know nothing about poker
[02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:34.780]   to average players in two weeks.
[02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:35.020]   Okay.
[02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:36.540]   It's not super ambitious.
[02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:41.340]   The course will utilize hand examples and discussions of common poker situations
[02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:42.860]   to study the fundamentals.
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:48.540]   The math, combinatoric and game theoretical aspects of poker will be covered with practical
[02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:49.180]   aspects.
[02:14:49.180 --> 02:14:55.660]   Lectures will focus on core concepts in Texas Hold 'em with an emphasis on cash games.
[02:14:55.660 --> 02:15:02.220]   And you'll get a guest lecture by 2005 World Series of Poker main event runner up, Steve Danonman.
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:05.260]   The runner up?
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:06.540]   Well, they couldn't get the guy.
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:08.220]   Well, you know, it's a free course.
[02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:09.180]   Free course.
[02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:12.620]   The other guy is often Bermuda now having a much better time than this guy.
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:14.540]   I think this is so awesome.
[02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:17.100]   This is one of the intercession course should be.
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:17.580]   And you know what?
[02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:20.220]   There's probably a little educational material in there.
[02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:20.700]   Yeah.
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:21.820]   Like game theory.
[02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:22.300]   Yeah.
[02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:22.700]   Math.
[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:23.580]   Yeah.
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:28.060]   When raise your hand, if you're gunning to win a trophy,
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:34.460]   that is at hopkinspokercourse.com.
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:43.820]   And we have come to the end of this extremely desultory kind of random walk of a show.
[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:45.580]   And I enjoyed every minute of it.
[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:46.540]   I love this show.
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:46.780]   Yeah.
[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:49.100]   And Jeff and I did not get in a battle.
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:49.580]   I tried.
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:50.300]   I baited him.
[02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:52.620]   But he showed real restraint.
[02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:55.500]   But he didn't want to waste his one click on the New Yorker.
[02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:56.140]   And that's not right.
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:15:59.260]   He is a man who will read the article.
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:01.660]   I knew I was there.
[02:16:01.660 --> 02:16:02.940]   And I just said I'm resisting.
[02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:07.900]   He is the the lawful good of journalism professors.
[02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:10.780]   Director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism.
[02:16:10.780 --> 02:16:11.260]   Oh, I'm not.
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:11.980]   How dare you?
[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:13.020]   Now we're going to have a fight over that.
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:14.060]   I am the evil guy.
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:14.380]   All right.
[02:16:14.380 --> 02:16:16.220]   He's chaotic evil of law.
[02:16:16.220 --> 02:16:16.780]   Jesus, the all-
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:17.900]   Journalist professors.
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:22.060]   The director of the Townite Center for Antra Panuio.
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:23.420]   There's journalism.
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:26.780]   It's a Craig Numac graduate school of journalism.
[02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:30.300]   It's a city university of New York.
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:30.860]   Mm-hmm.
[02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:36.460]   Blogger@buzzmachine.com and medium at Jeff Jarvis.
[02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:40.380]   And by the way, I have a new, so I just got a subdomain on medium.
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:41.740]   Wow.
[02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:44.620]   Jeff Jarvis at dot medium dot com.
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:46.060]   They just started putting out some domain.
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:49.020]   Is that because, oh, you had you had to apply for it?
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:49.980]   No, no.
[02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:51.980]   Because you're so prolific.
[02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:52.620]   That's awesome.
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:53.740]   Well, actually I'm not.
[02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:54.540]   But it's fine.
[02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:59.180]   So I tweeted yesterday that I had because I was a moment.
[02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:01.420]   I finished this one chapter and I printed it on the whole thing out.
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:05.500]   So I said I had 335 pages and 50% more to go.
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:08.780]   And some some wag from the Wall Street Journal said,
[02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:10.060]   Oh, your latest medium post.
[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:17.980]   By the way, let it not be that there is is Jeff Jarvis dot medium dot com.
[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:23.260]   Let it not be missed that Jeff who is already 10 out of 10 in rate.
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:29.420]   My sciperoom has decided to add not one, but two plants to his to his background.
[02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:30.300]   And show off.
[02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:32.780]   Another fake.
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:34.620]   Oh, please don't tell me that.
[02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:35.740]   That's just tacky.
[02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:40.140]   I'm just going to judge you.
[02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:42.140]   Thanks to mashed potato in a chat room.
[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:43.340]   Who is the first to notice?
[02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:47.180]   Stacy Higginbotham hung in there even though her head's killing her.
[02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:47.980]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:48.460]   I appreciate it.
[02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:49.420]   How are you feeling, Stacy?
[02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:50.380]   It got better.
[02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:51.420]   The drugs worked.
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:53.180]   I'm still spacey, but the drugs were.
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:53.900]   Spacey, Stacy.
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:54.700]   Stacy, Stacy.
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:57.740]   It could be that it was us that made you better.
[02:17:57.740 --> 02:17:59.020]   Never think of that.
[02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:00.700]   A little humor, a little levity.
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:02.620]   I will not take credit for that.
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:04.940]   Yeah, I'm like, I don't know about that.
[02:18:04.940 --> 02:18:05.660]   Yeah, I'll be sure.
[02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:05.660]   Sure.
[02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:07.180]   Little bit so.
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:11.020]   Stacy on IOT dot com.
[02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:14.540]   That's the place to go if you want to, in fact, subscribe to her newsletter there.
[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:18.060]   Because it's free and you've got an event coming up.
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:20.060]   I do have an event coming up, y'all.
[02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:21.500]   And I'm really excited about it.
[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:25.580]   It is October 27th from nine to noon PT.
[02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:26.940]   And it is about the smart home.
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:33.020]   And my thesis is we're about to next year get a bunch of technologies that are going to
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:34.860]   make the smart home more ubiquitous.
[02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:38.460]   So we need to talk about a couple things, those things being sustainability,
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:42.300]   dealing with consent and business models.
[02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:44.380]   So that's what we're going to talk about at this event.
[02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:47.660]   Now, how could people sign up for that their event?
[02:18:47.660 --> 02:18:50.460]   Oh, thank you for asking Leo.
[02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:51.660]   You are just so kind.
[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:54.860]   It just go to Stacy on IOT dot com slash event.
[02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:58.860]   And Bjorn is there from IKEA Bjorn Block.
[02:18:58.860 --> 02:18:59.420]   Yes.
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:02.540]   I hope he brings the Lingenberry Jam and Meatballs.
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:05.900]   Dave Crosby from WISE.
[02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:06.940]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:07.580]   That's going to be fun.
[02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:14.460]   Yeah, WISE is going to talk to us about their pay what you want for their camera subscriptions.
[02:19:14.460 --> 02:19:16.460]   Bjorn is going to be talking about sustainability.
[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:20.940]   I've got a bunch of people who aren't on the website yet, but we'll be soon.
[02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:23.580]   So it's going to be so fun.
[02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:25.180]   Go to talk about things you won't hear about.
[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:30.300]   Go to Stacy on IOT and click the events tab to register for that event coming up.
[02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:32.460]   October 27th, 9am Pacific.
[02:19:32.460 --> 02:19:34.460]   It's free.
[02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:35.340]   You're all invited.
[02:19:35.340 --> 02:19:36.940]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:41.100]   Don't forget our podcast too with the wonderful Kevin Tofel, the king of 5G.
[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:44.860]   And the god of Chromebooks.
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:48.780]   I'll get the advice next week.
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:49.820]   Yeah.
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:51.420]   Oh, you want some Chromebook advice?
[02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:51.740]   Go ahead.
[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:56.540]   Well, just do I go ahead and I got to buy one.
[02:19:56.540 --> 02:20:02.780]   So I go ahead and get the go or do I get the dollar with the fan, but Kevin likes it.
[02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:03.660]   Spin.
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:05.260]   It's a 713 spin.
[02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:05.740]   Spin.
[02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:07.100]   Really?
[02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:08.540]   Stacy, are you in touch with Kevin?
[02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:09.660]   Can you ask him right now?
[02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:11.980]   So Kevin tends to watch earlier.
[02:20:11.980 --> 02:20:13.420]   So I can't even ask.
[02:20:13.420 --> 02:20:16.380]   Well, he said he said if you don't want a fan, get the go.
[02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:20.540]   But otherwise, I think Kevin's Chromebook of 2020 is going to be the spin.
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:24.140]   He loves it about Chromebooks.com, if you want to know more.
[02:20:24.140 --> 02:20:26.780]   It's a 2-3 versus a 69.
