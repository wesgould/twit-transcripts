[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.260]   Hello, you almost caught me off guard looking at my phone making funny faces
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.980]   Snapchatting
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.900]   No, I was just trying to figure out an app. It's all good. Oh maybe a little later
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.420]   We'll find out what that app is Stacy is in Austin, Texas and in
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.620]   New Jersey today. It looks like we've got Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism at the City University
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.160]   My but shirt. Oh, I like that you look good. Yeah, I don't have a twig shirt
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.780]   Well, we can arrange one old. We'll get you you want some swag. We can send you swag. That's easy
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.600]   Saying you know, I got I'll show you I got a twit belt. Look at this. Oh, I thought you were gonna show me something different
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   No, oh nice
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.060]   See oh
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.700]   Lisa got that for me in case I get lost to Barcelona
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.260]   On the inside it says please return me to
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.260]   Well, of course if it does fall off, there'll be a twit logo on your ass. So
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.300]   Identify you that way. It says yeah, please see ass
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.940]   Poor Stacy you didn't get here for this kind of treatment
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.260]   So all right this finally we have a reason to talk about the president of the United States on this week in Google
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.300]   Yeah, we can't avoid it. Can we now he says
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.780]   Google is rigging search results against him and calls it very dangerous
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.820]   Apparently he had never googled his name before I don't know
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.380]   There was a pajamas media story that apparently got through to my guess Fox that got to him
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.380]   Is pajamas medium diamond and silk? No, that's that's the old
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.420]   Glen Reynolds, okay, it's dependent insta puddle of I don't know if Glenn's still on that
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.460]   But a whole bunch of conservative people back in the day started a conservative blog company called pajamas
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.620]   Media because the old joke was the bloggers were their pajamas right and
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.660]   And so now it's a it's a fairly right side
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.860]   I mean right end of spectrum very in the spectrum I would say so not as far as these days
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.460]   He can't really where do you put things he can't tell so this is a Paula Bullyard
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.780]   on put on pj media calm
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.800]   Is is it his conspiracy theory theory? They how do I get rid of this? I don't want that and how do I get rid of this?
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.220]   God the web is just a mess. Is it a conspiracy theory to suggest Google?
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.700]   Conserve we need is a Google here's the here's the original tweet pair
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.300]   Google search results for Trump news shows only the viewing reporting of fake news media in other words
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.220]   They have it rigged capital letters for me and others
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.780]   so that almost all stories
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:49.340]   And news is bad fake CNN is prominent Republican conservative fair media shutout illegal that this is the thing that should concern you
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.940]   illegal
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.940]   question mark
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.380]   96% of Google search results for Trump news
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.820]   Shows only the viewing reporting of fake news media. Oh wait a minute. I got a loop. I got a Trump loop. I'm sorry
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.540]   96% of results on Trump news are from the national left-wing media very dangerous
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.180]   Google and others are suppressing voices of conservatives and hiding information and news that is good
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.260]   They are controlling what we can and cannot see this is a very serious situation
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.380]   Will be addressed so that's the two things that are concerning and here to me
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.180]   I mean, of course he's gonna go off and this has been a long-standing
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.300]   trope that the you know the media's
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.660]   Liberal and they aren't giving conservative voices
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.060]   By the way, I will argue is true
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.500]   Yeah, and I've argued often that that we haven't invested in conservative
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.860]   Responsible conservative media to create an alternative to Fox. So when you do go on yeah, it's national liberal media and Fox
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.260]   That's the only alternative there is for people that much is true
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.340]   But that ain't Google's fault. That's the a keys. So Paula Bolyard who wrote this story originally for PG media
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:01.860]   I didn't I didn't ask about music. No, yeah, thank you
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.420]   You so don't tell me it's muted
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.580]   Using different
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.380]   Laptops you perform multiple Google news searches for the word trump
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.820]   I don't know how sophisticated by the way she is if she did it in incognito mode or not. That's not indicated here
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.460]   Exactly. This should end her account wrote a piece for the Washington Post saying oops
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.700]   Uh, I don't know what I started here regulation. I don't I'm no conservative. So I don't want regulation
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.860]   Yeah, that's the problem with this and by the way, here's the two words that worry me illegal
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.500]   And we'll be addressed now
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   Okay, no if they were from like a legitimate policymaker
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.300]   Sure, but trump has not yeah, he's not a policy oriented person
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.940]   Is the president of the United States?
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.220]   I know
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:52.180]   And it is possible that one of his staff members would say oh I should take it upon myself to make this happen
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.900]   kind of like steven miller did with immigration but
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.060]   most of his staff members would look at that and say oh
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.380]   That is not something our base is going to appreciate so I
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:10.740]   Yes, this is worrisome. No or not. No, it's not worrisome. I don't think there's gonna come up
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:18.660]   Something's not gonna come up with this. So somebody in the chat room rf 2020 says google is definitely shadow banning people it does not like
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.100]   I would ask for proof
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.260]   and a definition of
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.940]   Not shadow banning but there google shows you what it thinks you want to see
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:36.100]   In some extent why in order to do this properly you have to go into an incognito mode or log out of your google account because
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.140]   It will of course change search results
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.700]   oddly though
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:49.060]   Uh, if you do that, uh and enter donald j trump you'll get fox news is one of the first results. So yeah, maybe maybe
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.460]   I don't you know is it showing the president what he wants to see probably not
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.900]   Well, he can't that word is he doesn't use a desktop computer. He doesn't know how to oh so it's a mobile
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.620]   Well or somebody showed it to him or the
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.940]   You know what he probably didn't do the search. He just saw this
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:10.820]   Now paula boeys and herself tweeted for those who are asking i'm not calling for government regulations to solve the problem
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.300]   Well of bias
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.700]   Yeah, it's their private companies. They can run their companies. However. They want government almost always makes things worse
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.340]   Which is a fairly reasonable?
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.340]   response
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.460]   Stacy
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.820]   The problem though is a couple things one. There's a chill. You don't have to pass a law to have an impact
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.820]   to
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.140]   This is the president of the United States. So I would argue that football players in the nfl who have kneeled
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.420]   Have a civil rights case a first amendment case against trump because he's trying to intimidate he's trying to get them fired
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.500]   He's trying to use the power of his office
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.020]   to
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.620]   Stifle their speech
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:52.340]   And he's trying to influence twitter and facebook and now google to make changes because of the power of his office and because what he brings
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:59.140]   That's precisely what the first amendment is meant to protect from is that kind of authoritarianism? That's precisely what he's trying to bring to this
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.780]   So, okay, I agree with leo i'm still worried whether or not you pass a law
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:10.180]   Um, the attempt that he's making here and the larger thing that he's doing of course is that he's going after anyone
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.860]   With authority other than him right the media
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.340]   The fbi adjustment are all wrong. Uh google is now
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:26.980]   Doing this facebook and twitter are unfair to conservatives blah blah blah blah so believe none of them truth isn't truth believe only me
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.380]   classic technique
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.900]   Okay, and and I say as a free speech thing. I can see this. I wouldn't worry about actual regulations coming from this
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.820]   Uh, which is kind of where my brain was heading and
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:44.820]   Yeah, yeah, but I would say i'm not gonna it is disturbing
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:52.820]   I am far more upset by trump's misuse of his office just for petty everyday corruption like
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:00.180]   Having the secret service stay in his hotels while he he still has ownership stakes in them and some of the things his family members are doing
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.580]   That is far more disturbing to me than just him bullying people from twitter
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.820]   What about I do see that that is it that that is a issue
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.220]   What about the case made here by uh, oliver darcy of uh cnn
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:21.460]   That and he this is a quote from his story with his tweet trump his signal that he and his republican allies would continue to paint tech giants
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:29.300]   Like facebook and twitter as villains in a long standing culture war use to excite the conservative base that seems to be much more likely
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.700]   What he's up to right?
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.340]   It's it's always politics and in this case
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.380]   Uh, you know this it's great to have an enemy
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.940]   Especially as you're going into an election
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.100]   And what it looks like to me now it's google facebook twitter the internet elites
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.580]   We already have the media leads but now it's the internet elites that are also villains, right?
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:55.380]   Right and and you have the new york post and fox news that are also going at rupert bergach has been going after the platform's all along
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.180]   so now they're in line with each other attacking google and
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:05.620]   Uh, also the other platforms from a competitive standpoint and then i'm trying to talk to people from my world from media today on
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.780]   Well, it's our world on on twitter
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:13.460]   Uh saying that this puts us media on the same in the same firing line
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.740]   as the platforms and and we defend the platforms speech here
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:24.820]   Uh to defend our own and so media being constantly pardon me dystopian
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.620]   Uh and shooting at the platforms as competitors, you know, fine. That's business
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:35.300]   But there's unintended consequences to be had here. We're watching them happen as of now
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:42.100]   I don't so here's here's my quibble with this. Trump has a problem with truth
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.820]   not I mean what he calls fake news and a left
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:52.900]   A left oriented bias in the media is very different than what you know
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:59.460]   The bushes may have experienced and and yes are many people who write for the media
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.820]   Are we mostly liberal? I would say probably so and i'm sure there's data to back that up and i'm sure you have it Jeff
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.220]   so
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.020]   I I think really what he's doing here is he's just
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.140]   He's just out out lying and I I'm not worried about that. I mean I I'm worried about that one sense, but I don't
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.380]   The problem here isn't that google is biased
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:28.660]   The problem is that trump is deciding that everything that he doesn't like is not true and thus biased and thus quote-unquote illegal
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.060]   So of course there's a much more issue
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.100]   We're not nobody disagrees with you on that but because it's this week in google
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.780]   I thought i focus on the impact on the tech sector
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:43.620]   We can't argue if the stove started the fire or if it was you know a lit match
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:49.700]   We the house is on fire you guys. Let's not focus like i'm surprised to hear you say that because we know
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.540]   I I just thought you didn't want to talk about that
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.540]   No, I just um
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:06.340]   Anyway, I just what do you do if you're google and let's say 80 percent of media, you know is is left leaning
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.660]   Do you then change your search results to be 50 50 and
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:19.700]   By doing so boost up the 20 percent. That's not and it's not left leaning necessarily while the writers may be left leaning
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.420]   Most of the stuff that's news organizations right is still true. Right. So
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.940]   Yeah, that's an important distinction
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:34.500]   And just by arguing for this in that argument that you were set to make falls into this camp of like the same sort of
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.020]   Oh, we can't be biased against anti-vaxxers. We must report both sides equally. That's a bull
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.700]   And I love science. I love media
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.900]   Not a I actually used to be more conservative in a fiscal way
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.460]   Then you're in Austin
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.900]   Well, no, I mean even more conservative than people in Austin
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.940]   So when uh, when the president of the United States has to tech companies better be careful
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.180]   Uh as he does here
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.340]   um
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.780]   Let me see if my audio is functioning
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.900]   Serious thing and it's a very serious charge
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:18.100]   I think what google and what others are doing if you look at what's going on at twig. Scroll down. Maybe
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.340]   What's going on? Oh, he's not showing what i'm showing. So right let's start over
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:28.580]   Let's start over. So this was yesterday
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:36.260]   I think google is uh really taking advantage of a lot of people and I think that's a very serious thing and it's a very serious charge
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.900]   I think what google and what others are doing if you look at what's going on at twitter
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.620]   If you look at what's going on in facebook
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.980]   Uh, they better be careful because you're you can't do that to people you can't do it. We have tremendous
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:53.140]   We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:58.500]   And you just can't do that. So I think that google and twitter and facebook
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:05.220]   They're really treading on very very trouble territory and they have to be careful. It's not fair to large portions
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.140]   Of the population that worries me. They have to be careful. What are we what do they have to be careful of?
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.180]   He doesn't ever say
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.180]   He's so he doesn't need you
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:22.420]   He I know he does it needs to know actually you could make the argument he's smart enough not to say concretely
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.900]   That's what I say
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.540]   that it's sufficient merely to say that
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:34.740]   And then the wheels start turning look how facebook has has has tripped over itself since it's trending
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.580]   at jac door c at twitter and jac door c going on
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:44.020]   Fox right they are tripping over themselves to try to not get in trouble
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:50.260]   Uh with are they afraid of regulation or are they afraid of uh, I don't know
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:55.940]   Molotov cocktails. What are they what are they worried about? I think they're afraid of regulation. I think they're afraid of boycotts
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.460]   I think they're afraid of advertisers getting scared of them
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.420]   I think they should be very
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:09.620]   I think they're probably also afraid of the disconnect between the regulatory environment. They're finding themselves in in the us and
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.260]   the historical
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.740]   Way they have run their companies and their user base here in the us because
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:22.100]   as a country that's fragmented and being from the us
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.180]   I think they're good. I mean it would be terrifying to suddenly be like holy cow
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.020]   We have to uphold these same sort of rules that we uphold in kind of
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.420]   More authoritarian places where we're used to that, but their employees are here
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.380]   Those people are not going to let them do this. So
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.340]   I mean that's got to be terrifying as a company
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:47.140]   Google said yesterday when users searched for content quote our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:52.340]   We make hundreds of improvements to our algorithms every year to ensure high quality content is returned
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.700]   in response to users queries. We never this is the
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:03.940]   Important quote we never ranked this I'm reading from time. We never ranked search results to manipulate political sentiment. Is that true?
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.380]   I would think it would be
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:13.300]   The best way to answer this actually would have would have be to look at what they've done in other countries
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.340]   Where the government has historically been more
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.340]   proactive about what Google shows people
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.860]   Right I would say it's doubly bad time for Google to go into China
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.020]   Yeah, I mean we talked about this last week that Google
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:37.940]   No, it has and Sergey brain admitted has a project to create a censored version of Google for China at the behest of the Chinese government
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:44.580]   Um, would would Google then consider a censored version of Google for the us government?
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.820]   Well, what they'll say what Google what the platform will always say is we will follow local law, right?
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:56.500]   So that goes to bistacy's point is we will be safe for the law in this country because we have a constitution still
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.500]   um
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.460]   But
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.940]   It probably won't reach that level. There'll be other impact you look at there's a story on the times today
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.940]   It says dozens at facebook you need to challenge
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.180]   Uh, it's intolerant liberal culture. Somebody said on twitter when I tweeted this
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.660]   Uh, well, I'm sure dozens of people have complained about what's uh, you know, there aren't enough
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.820]   um
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.700]   Vegetarian items in the food free food line actually that's hundreds probably thousands. Uh, yeah
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:27.140]   Yeah, but but you have this atmosphere of what stacy was saying of the false balance
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.860]   that comes up all too easily
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.140]   and um, you know, I do think there's a problem of
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:39.620]   Perspective in the larger media ecosystem and i'm liberal and i'm media and I will i will confess that sin on behalf of my brethren
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:43.940]   Uh, I think it's an issue. I think it's what part of the reason where where we are
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.420]   But there's nothing to do with what trump's doing and the reaction that stacy mentions of this one
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.380]   What's gonna balance going? Uh, oh, what's gonna balance going mean that if leo what you're gonna say was what you were saying was
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.940]   Are you gonna balance by institution or by story? And if you're gonna start balancing by store
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.460]   You're gonna start balancing at all. It's wrong because stacy's right if I said that enough
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.660]   um
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.660]   uh that
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:10.020]   Uh, this is about facts and it's about it's about legitimate responsible and intellectually honest reporting
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.140]   But even so if you say okay leo, we need some more right stuff
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.580]   Well, the next thing line on the right stuff gets you to bright bar really fast
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.660]   Because there's not much more. There's nothing more than the wall street journal and fox
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:26.980]   Cara swish right picked the new your time. It picked a good time to add cara swisher to their uh editorial board
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.660]   Her uh opinion piece today trump's ludicrous attack on big
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.780]   Tech the idea that google and twitter rigging their platforms against him is patently false. I love her lead
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.540]   Here's the truest conundrum of the social media age
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.420]   Those who complain loudest about being silenced never ever shut up
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:52.020]   He says she says i'm sorry that trump instead of attacking tech he should send them a golden boss. Thank you note
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:57.860]   Uh, I guess because what because uh
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:05.220]   She says most tech leaders are more often lightweight versions of libertarians and largely a political except for
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:10.180]   Backing gay and transgender rights in wanting to allow more qualified immigrants into the country to make more tech
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.180]   Otherwise, am I reporting?
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:19.540]   I found they love those tax cuts and adore the repatriated income true true and can't get enough of deregulation
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:24.820]   Sure, they don't cotton to the anti climate change nonsense mr. Trump's pews
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:30.260]   Uh, of course everybody withdrew from the tech board when he uh pulled out of the paris accords
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.900]   And they can't stand the endless bullying, but let's stop to reflect that they have handed him all the weapons
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.900]   In his online arsenal to do that that's what he has to be thankful for
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:44.500]   Uh, I think you could easily make the case that uh trump's election
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.580]   Had a lot to do with facebook and and his effective use of facebook or the russians effective use somebody's
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.540]   effective
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.380]   Somebody else on twitter said that you can hold these two ideas in mind at the same time
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:02.100]   The most of the staff at facebook is probably liberal but that facebook is a has been made a better tour
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.500]   Uh has been better exploited by the right than the left
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:12.260]   I don't know. I mean as far even as in and I haven't looked at the makeup of their lobbying efforts recently
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:18.740]   But probably three years ago facebook's lobbyists were all highly conservative even in the above administration
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:24.340]   So I don't know where that is today. What should so jeff pazos had has been under attack
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.300]   He just ignores he just completely ignores it
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:34.020]   He completely ignores what should should facebook and twitter who are not ignoring it. They're scrambling around like crazy
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.780]   Uh
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.300]   Do the same and and what what should google do is it was best thing to do just
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:46.500]   Pazos doesn't have a social now. I mean, I know that trump's attacking him and he did actually respond to some of the worker allegations
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.740]   But I mean
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.540]   Pazos doesn't have a social network he owns the washington post
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.660]   So from his perspective there is no benefit for him to speak up on any of this
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.860]   Right
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:04.260]   And that he care is absolutely right that that all of these guys have benefited from repatriation lower tax rates
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.980]   Uh deregulation it's all been good
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.220]   So I think leo
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.220]   to answer your question that
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.340]   Um
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:17.060]   The platformers would do well and wise to follow the lead of floyd abraham's in the new york times
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:22.020]   And say this is a this is a matter of the first amendment. This is a matter of free speech. Don't tell us how to do our jobs
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.300]   It's not your job to do that. We're doing our job. We're doing it well
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.740]   And it is our prerogative to do it not yours to tell us how to do it
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.580]   This is a matter of the first amendment. This is why it exists. This is why we're in this country and
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.300]   Meeting people should be right behind them saying what they say
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.900]   And and rather than snaping at the platform says certain
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.180]   Um
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:45.620]   Trade groups still do what towards today with somebody from a trade group in the mag in the publishing industry
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.500]   Um, well, well, I stand for the first member, but I still want to complain about google a lot enough
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.460]   There's a common enemy here and that's the anybody who's against the truth is against us
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.420]   And we've got to stand together here and we got to recognize and I said this in the show two weeks ago
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.820]   That whether you like it or not
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.140]   Our best ally against
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.780]   Russian election manipulation is facebook and twitter. That's just it
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.660]   Anything or the only ones doing anything. So that's where we are. I don't know how effective it is
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:18.820]   I don't know how allies how much of their heart is in doing this is the real question jeff
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.460]   Yeah, how much of their heart is in doing anything about it now it's strongly in it
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.460]   I think now it isn't wasn't before
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.860]   but but our our our and our joint
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:34.020]   Cause and concern is to protect speech and the first amendment from this kind of
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.940]   Of authoritarian intervention and we should be standing together
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.980]   That's true and google and facebook don't want that kind of authoritarian intervention
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.780]   Right because they I mean how complicated at it's just
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:55.620]   Forget about morality and ethics. It's complicated to deal with this many policies for this many places and types of people in the world
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:01.380]   So anything that fragments the kind of global platform is a pain for them
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.780]   One social media kara swisser's last few paragraphs are probably
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.820]   The most telling as one social media executive said to me recently with an audible sigh
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:16.900]   For one set we can't take down enough for another we can't we set can't leave up enough
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:23.140]   One side thinks social media enabled populism the other thinks the opposite there will be no fixing this
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.140]   Which makes for a kind of digital gridlock that is perfect for mr
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.020]   Trump
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:33.940]   Even though he seems not to be in on the giant tech joke. He is created in an interview with
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:38.020]   Trump conducted by mark lee bevitch of the new york times about a year ago
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:44.740]   Quote trump says they want to take away my voice. He declared plaintiff lee even as he bragged
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.340]   About the 54 million he reaches directly with every tweet
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:53.060]   On his dot real donald trump handle along with 23 million more on that potus
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.860]   They're not going to take away my social media
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:01.220]   She ends the uh, the piece no mr. President they're not
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:07.860]   So it is kind of an odd conundrum on the one hand he has probably
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.740]   The best bully pulpit of any president ever
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.460]   only pulpit well titled
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.460]   Yes
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.260]   Yeah, that was teddy rosary be
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.700]   Be best
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:26.500]   Yeah, the best bully pulpit. No, I said be best be best. I was referring back to anti-bullying and bullying
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.060]   Be best with the anti and bully
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.620]   Okay, um
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.380]   I this is
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.460]   Can we stop talking about this now or we still know we're done
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:41.060]   I'm like this is one of those thing. I'm like we could talk for hours and not make any headway
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.500]   It was perfect. We we discussed the issue. I think I'm glad kara's editorial
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.820]   Uh, that was actually a great way to kind of I think sum it up. I think we all agree with kara
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:57.620]   On on I should do my standing disclosure that I raised money for my school from facebook as well as kragano
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:02.020]   Mark and the fort foundation and others i'm independent of the mar receive no money personally from the man of disclosure
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.180]   Let's take a break when we come back stacey will pick the first topic
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.140]   Go
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.340]   I'm not going to be here for another three weeks after this, you know
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:18.660]   You could pick all the topics next week. Jason how your mind your mind is somewhere in the better terrain. Yeah already
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.860]   Yeah
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.740]   I was really uh punchy on windows weekly. I'm
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:29.220]   Calm down a little bit as I come back to us leo stick with us here just for a few more hours
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.340]   You need that you need that punchin thing right now, stacey
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.140]   Are you sure they need
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.820]   Go ahead. Oh, you know by the way on saturday. We had a robot maker on
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.260]   And she's gonna she said oh yeah, I could do that
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.260]   Did you have some on?
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.020]   Uh, she's of uh, no jillian of less let's robot
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.940]   dot tv
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:56.260]   Oh also exciting. Yeah, check that she it's kind of twitch for uh internet controlled robots
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.620]   So
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.620]   If you go to let's robot
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.020]   Dot tv
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.940]   You can watch robots being controlled over the internet
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.220]   Um better by a helmet leo
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.940]   Uh, and so if I go to her
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.940]   Uh page which is let's robot dot tv slash
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.220]   robo caster slash jill
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.580]   So she says she can build
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.380]   She has a bunch of robots, but she can build a robot
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:33.540]   That uh, I guess nothing's really active right now, but uh, but we'll see I can control it up here
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.940]   But she can build a robot that you can uh, you can punch me
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.460]   Oh excellent. I found I found a friend of mine named hugo
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.860]   Is also volunteered to build one. He's the ceo over at electric imp
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.020]   So she's like, oh, is your one jill said when she first started that she uh, was doing it on twitch
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.740]   And she built a slapping robot and people paid on twitch to uh slapper
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.900]   She got 300 whatever the twitch bucks are in one day
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:03.380]   I've I believe that I'm so hard. What would you pay?
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.180]   Stacey to punch leo
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.500]   When he says something nasty
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.700]   You know what? I actually wouldn't pay anything. I could just hang up
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.180]   But I wonder how much the audience would pay
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.740]   Oh, oh, oh, oh
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:22.100]   Or even no jeff or no stacey. I mean we shouldn't make it fair. That's true. That's true
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.740]   Have to have these there definitely people
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.740]   Yeah, who'd be like
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.220]   jeff no or stacey stop talking
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.940]   So it could happen
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:39.220]   I showed you my cash fly if you are running a I don't know a uh, internet controlled robot site
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:47.300]   Or a podcast site or if you deliver content anyway to your customers you not you need to know about cdns
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.100]   Content delivery networks and our cdn
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.380]   The best which is cash fly
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.220]   We've been we've been on cash fly for almost a decade
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.860]   literally without flaw and I asked uh
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.620]   Cash fly
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.660]   What our bandwidth for twig for this week in google alone
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.460]   Last month
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.460]   771.8 gigabytes
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.940]   On cash fly we do petabytes a month for the network as a whole
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:22.820]   All flawlessly if you get this podcast if you is subscribed and you get it fast if you watch it download
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.460]   Uh on the web page
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.900]   That's cash fly cash fly has been building trusted cdn relationships since 2002
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.460]   They eliminate outages with a hundred they guarantee a hundred percent availability
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.020]   With their bulletproof 100 sla
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:44.500]   But it's more than just that they've got great a great team matt lavin and his team are so good
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:50.260]   Uh smart easy to talk to techies that when you call will answer your questions the first time
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:54.420]   Without having to pass you around to five different departments. I will vouch for that
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.220]   And what I really love is it's much more affordable
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.940]   It's vid you will save on average
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:08.100]   More than 20 percent say goodbye to logging in a couple of times a week or even every day trying to figure out
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.580]   Ah how much is this gonna cost me at the end of the month?
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:17.060]   20 percent just imagine what you could do with 20 percent in the time when you don't have to micromanage your usage or worry
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.380]   About having to commit to a long-term contract based on a growth plan you didn't even write
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.540]   That's a crazy way to buy cdn
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.540]   We would not exist
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:30.500]   Without cash fly we host all our podcasts on cash fly audio and video
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.900]   As I said for the show alone
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.820]   771.8 giga giga
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.700]   Giga bits or giga bites. I think giga bites of throughput on cash fly peta bites every month
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:45.380]   Join the thousands of others who like me trust cash flies reliable network. There's a few of them right there

[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.100]   Oh, yes. Yes, I have
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.620]   You get to pick

[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.500]   It is about me
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.220]   We in june
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.780]   June better not be moving to bamf
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.660]   We're moving to seattle. Oh, congratulations
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:06.900]   Wow, that is our plan. So you had so much fun there this summer you decided to move there
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.660]   I've been pushing it for years. Finally. My husband said yes, let's do it
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.420]   Yes, you can work it. You're not taking a job there. You're going to continue to do what you're doing, right?
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.740]   I I am going to continue what I'm doing. Yeah, doing what I'm doing. That's the beauty of what we do
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.500]   You can do it anywhere
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:27.540]   Exactly as long as he's broadband. Yeah, broadband and does your husband have a job in austin or is he just he has a similar type of job
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.060]   He does well
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.220]   He has a job. He does lots of jobs, but they're they're not locations. He can do them anywhere
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.340]   Yes, so what was his resistance you have family down there?
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.100]   Um
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.500]   I you know, it's hard to move for no reason
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.940]   Other than you want to especially when you're moving from a cheaper place to a more expensive place. Yeah, that's true
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.100]   Yeah, you know, and you got to pick up a kid
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:54.980]   Well, that's the thing now's the time to do that. You're crossing your daughter is young enough that it won't be a real disruption
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.780]   She going will she be in fifth grade fourth grade?
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:02.100]   Oh no, she's third grade. She's she's in seventh grade right now seventh
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.100]   So she'll be changed. So she'll be going to a new eighth. Oh, that is tough
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.420]   That's a little tough. I was hoping she was going from six to seven or eight to nine
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:16.340]   No, and we thought about going another year, but dang it. It's hot here. It is
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.740]   Notice by the way, that's when people say we're moving is in august in austin
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.900]   Well
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.980]   Yeah, and you know, maybe we won't be able to do it, but why not take the chance?
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.500]   So stay see no more queso for you
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:38.580]   That is actually honor. We have a list of pros and cons in case it was a part of it. Oh my god
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:44.980]   queso tech's mex technically made the list but you know, I bet you'll find good tech's mess mix up there and
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:51.060]   They have good interior mix. Um, we'll see. We'll see. Who's in the chat room kevin c toful
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.100]   He's shocked shocked to hear this news
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:58.100]   Oh, no, we talked about it. I wasn't going to tell you guys for another several months
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:03.620]   But I was like, yeah, I was since I was caught out doing something related to that. I was like oh, okay
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:12.100]   Uh, so here's here's my my pitch for our story. It's a broadband story because you know, I love my FCC
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.100]   Uh, ours tectica just put out a story
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:24.420]   Uh, this after noon about saying the FCC can define markets with only one ISP now is competitive what according
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.100]   This is an ours tectica thing. This is from the
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:34.900]   Um, I'm trying to read which us appeals court for the eighth circuit. Oh no
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.740]   So so there was a competitive market test
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.860]   That existed. Yes
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.940]   Uh, and the and this was challenged in court
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.460]   By the sea licks
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:55.700]   So sea licks are who they're the phone companies, right? They're the competitive local exchange carriers. So they're the not mobiles
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.940]   The not bells and purchasers of business broadband
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:07.780]   Because the FCC voted last year to eliminate price caps on some business broadband providers like 18 t and verizon
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:15.060]   In any given county if 50 of potential customers are within half a mile
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:22.100]   Of a location served by a competitive provider. You just move you move. It's only half a mile
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:27.300]   So we discussed this this is a huge thing. These are I call these broadband black holes
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.780]   And it's we see this
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.660]   Our policy for decades has been to ignore
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:37.220]   These issues and there's a couple ways. So there's this particular example
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.300]   There's also with the national broadband map
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:46.900]   Where you don't actually get address level information for who has broadband and what they have you grab zip level information
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.100]   So it's possible for you to be in an area that's competitive
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:57.140]   But still only have one provider because you're person the same zip. Yeah, I have it all the time by the way
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.380]   Yes, this is I mean
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:04.740]   I could probably call 10 people and at least one of them will be currently right now having this problem
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.700]   Right. So I'm in a zip code that theoretically has two or more internet service providers
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.980]   But I only have one that will serve my house or my business
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:18.740]   And this is one of those issues where you know broadly it doesn't sound terrible
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:25.860]   But individually it's horrific and like I just said you cannot do business today without having a broadband connection
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.780]   I would argue you can't live as a consumer without it, but you know, there are people who do
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.700]   Personally, I think it's a problem, but you know, some people don't want it
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.460]   uh
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.460]   and this is just
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.780]   So messed up so nothing to do with google, but a really frustrating
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:49.460]   Issue we still don't have a solution for it. We may never I'm hopeful and 5g by the way will not solve this
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.340]   necessarily
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:56.020]   Because you can't in a lot of areas where it's real problem like in rural areas
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:00.180]   5g isn't necessarily going to be able to go out that far
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.300]   So that's all this was my story because
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.020]   I'm a private
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.460]   Um, yeah, we just it's really amazing
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:16.260]   You would think that the FCC of all people would represent the people
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.380]   Really?
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:26.020]   And and and try to get an equitable situation for people in the United States who are suffering with
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.100]   among the worst broadband in the developed world because of
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:36.500]   anti-competitive pressures from you know, these duopoly's created admittedly by the FCC at the behest
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.780]   of the cable and phone companies, but you would think
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:43.380]   This is a government agency that they would be
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.740]   Trying to make internet access
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:52.180]   Easier more available less costly all of the things which are good for society
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.820]   Have you not heard of regulatory capture?
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:38:00.020]   And and I would argue actually here's here's where these things break down is most
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.580]   In the tech world most companies who are like
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.260]   I have a cool service. I want to get more people to use it
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:12.260]   So I can sell more of my service think of intel and silicon like chips think of amazon and cloud services
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.540]   so
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.620]   the telcos though
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:22.100]   That is not their mindset the quote unquote it mindset is absolutely not theirs. They don't they don't want to give you more of
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.900]   Things that use their product. They don't necessarily want you
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.860]   to like view their product as a platform on which to grow businesses because
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.220]   They want to treat their product as this
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.500]   high price super valuable thing and it's
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.380]   It is where it's basically like what more's law meets the telcos
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.980]   Everything goes to hell
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.060]   The f's the judge is basically accepted the FCC's argument that
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:53.460]   the impact of a competitor even if the competitor is not
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:58.100]   Actually competing but the but if a competitor is within half a mile
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:03.700]   That assures a reasonably competitive outcomes in the medium term
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.660]   as long as they're close
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.580]   So absurd
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.780]   That's like saying
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.940]   You live in america and canada has rogers and you're next to it. So it's okay
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.420]   right
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:22.980]   Or yeah, I mean in in this is the FCC did not even attempt to show that this is true
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.740]   The judges they just said it was and the judges said all right. Well, you're the FCC you say so so
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.940]   It must be true
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.100]   Well in the FCC can't prove it because and in the the
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.740]   Problem is also on the flip side
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:42.340]   The consumer groups can't prove it either because we don't actually have access to that data
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.180]   But the because the telcos say that address level
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.300]   Who gets what data is competitive to them?
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.860]   so if at and if like
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.980]   At and t's exact service footprint were available as a public record
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.940]   Everyone could see it and everyone would know and then atnt just loses its competitive edge
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:09.380]   I think that is I think the policy needs for understanding who and where broadband is outweigh their competitive
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.100]   concerns, especially given
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:20.580]   Given that they only have one competitor in most markets the judges basically say that both sides neither side has data
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.140]   So both sides are applying an economic theory
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.660]   And the judge the judges say the FCC can rationally choose
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:33.140]   Whatever evidence it wants to believe among conflicting evidence
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:38.020]   And we're not gonna get in the way. They can follow us with truth truth is not truth
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.500]   They can believe whatever they want to because they're the FCC
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.100]   It's our world today
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:52.900]   Thanks for depressing us Stacy. All right. Cheer up. Cheer up. Google france is taking down its google plus page
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:59.380]   And french even at google the french of the french and they're saying follow us on twitter or facebook
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.860]   Is it the beginning of the end of google plus it is in france?
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:08.340]   I have to say I did disconnect from all my
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:13.620]   Big-time social media this week. I killed my twitter account killed instagram. Oh geez
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.300]   Facebook
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:20.580]   I killed tumblr. I didn't I even killed tumblr, but I didn't bother to kill google plus because
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.220]   Who cares?
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:29.780]   You were terrible. I even killed tumblr. But I didn't kill google plus should I kill google plus too
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:35.300]   No, why bother? You can't kill google plus because you have a google account you can't
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.180]   so
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.060]   I you know i'm gonna do something i'm gonna send postcards anybody wants a postcard i'll mail you one
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:47.540]   I think it's a more civilized way to share
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.180]   innovation
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:55.940]   Dear jeff james the road to here was so long and we lost four of our children
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.580]   To the measles exactly
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.220]   It's the daughter party
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:06.820]   Uh, organ trail. Uh, let's see google has confirmed. You know oil. I want a new show
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:15.220]   Why I think quick google this week in techno panic. It's not techno panic. It's not even i'm not even advocating it
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:22.180]   I quit it because it's a river of sewage coming into my brain and I just you know, I thought you know, maybe I could just turn that off
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.700]   Oh look
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.980]   It worked what I did do i'm gonna confess
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.060]   Uh
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.060]   Is I had a twivter twitter account
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:38.260]   Lying around that's just news sources so because there there is a value to having a newsfeed right
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.260]   So I carefully curated just news just reliable
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.420]   Unfake news sources and so if I if somebody you know like
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:51.860]   Is you know somebody dead or something is it was there an earthquake if something like that happens? I can go there
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.660]   So I'm I admit it's not completely withdrawing from twitter, but
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:43:00.740]   I don't it's not like i'm going. Oh my god. What do I do? It's like, yeah, I use twitter through lists
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.900]   Yeah, I have a problem. I have a problem list and a media walks list
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:09.140]   That's those are the lists i'm looking for but I have lists like tech news
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.700]   Yeah, I know stuff like that. What's the thing? Yeah, but you pick who you want on it. That's who you read and it's fine
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.100]   And then but I don't need the rest of it
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.980]   You didn't get the rest of it. I but if you use your list you don't but if you don't use your list, what are you?
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.980]   Right. So use the list and then it's fine
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.540]   Or just kill your account
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.100]   Okay, okay
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:32.340]   You're never gonna agree just Leo corner jeff corner
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:36.820]   River of sewage bill donahue reporter at law 360
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.940]   Says build on you or build on you filled on you whatever happened to filled on you
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:51.540]   Filled on a he build on he who says google is confirmed for me the company will indeed appeal the ruling and oracle versus google to the supreme court
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.140]   This is the case that google lost
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.740]   uh the court ruled that uh
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.580]   uh google's use of uh
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:07.060]   Java and actually no I apologize google's use of the java api
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.980]   oracle owns java
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.940]   uh was not fair use and so uh
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:17.300]   Anyway, we'll see we don't know if the supreme court will hear it, but it but it is it is a significant
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.140]   issue
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:23.860]   uh in the fair use doctrine as well as software copyrights if you ask me although
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.980]   I think it was stipulated that software
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.180]   copyrights are legal
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.500]   So that's why they went to the fair use defense
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.100]   Nothing more to say just
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.740]   Oh
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:43.940]   Good because I I saw that and I was like oh gosh this case will a never end it'd be oh
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.580]   Everything I learned the first
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:51.140]   Yes, it's very complicated. It was very complicated. It is in a case of whether
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:58.500]   Google store stole java. It's a case of whether google could legally using the fair use rules
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:05.060]   Use a copyrighted api it was even agreed that the api was copyrightable which I thought was very odd
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.220]   That didn't seem right at all, but that's that's a done deal. That's over
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:12.500]   um
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.340]   Here's some uh something maybe the president would consider if you put a little google home
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:21.140]   Oh, and we already talked about this last week darn it. Well, you did okay. Sorry. I put that one in there
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.660]   Yeah, yeah, this is part of the changelog. I brought back the changelog while you were gone
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:31.060]   No, you didn't do it before. Oh, okay. I was here. You know, there's reentry. Yeah, that's right. There is a google home story
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:35.140]   Um your I was gonna tell it about the good news thing just so people know
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:41.140]   Sorry. Yeah, go ahead. Oh wait, but we did good news. Yeah, yeah, right. That's really yeah. We did it last week
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:47.220]   Is it when you were gonna bring up to I could listen to the show lefty. No, no, I was gonna bring up a different google assistant story
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.140]   They made that one or sorry. Give me that one. Okay
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:57.860]   So your nest by no yes nest by yel lock now works with google assistant in theory
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.820]   What is the nest by yel lock?
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.140]   What you don't know about the nest by yel lock leo is that really is a nest
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.860]   it is it is a
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:14.100]   Connected door lock. That's part of the nest ecosystem. It is made by yel. It is actually a lovely lock
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:19.220]   Um, it's 239. I believe it's pretty and it is yeah
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.300]   It's actually an attractive looking luck. I have it installed it works, but
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:28.100]   It has not actually been integrated into the google home
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.060]   Yet until
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.060]   Today possibly today
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.620]   But it's not working yet because kevin tried it and then later after kevin failed. I also tried it
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:43.140]   So I don't know if I'm just having issues because I have had issues connecting things to google home from my nest account
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.580]   Um
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.900]   Or if it's just how to rolled out to me
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.860]   Well as long as we're talking
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:53.060]   You can also use the amazon spot
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:47:01.060]   To use your ring video camera ring as a sponsor and your nest cameras and even your wise cameras
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:09.460]   So people don't like the spot because it's watching you but now you can watch them while they're watching you or something take that ha ha
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:15.780]   Crazy crazy another story related story from the from my numbers. Yes. I always have extras
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:20.740]   Oh good is the google haul according to one analyst google home is out shipping echo. Yeah
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.540]   Isn't that interesting it is and at um
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.940]   efah
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.740]   Google home they say is everywhere is on everything
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:38.660]   Well, that's just a function of google's marketing and I will still tell you from every single connected device maker that I talk to
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:46.100]   Their priorities and integration are madam a first right so the amazon echo first followed by google followed by ift
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:51.780]   Yeah, that's interest ift is in there. Huh? That's interesting because they ift is if this then that is a
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.100]   Glue for all of them
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:48:01.460]   Maybe or they just there's enough early. I mean because we're still at a fairly early adopter stage for most of these so true. Yeah
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:09.140]   In early adopters like ift because it is it's it's a powerful tool that much use things super powerful
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:14.100]   Harmon karden has announced a new google assistant speaker. It's only
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.980]   600 dollars
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:24.500]   600 but that's presumably it's about the size of the google all max right this is another efah
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:30.580]   Thing it'll be available for pre-order in europe only at the end of september. I'm not sure when it'll come to the united states
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:34.900]   Um, so leo and i are old enough to remember that even in our dorm rooms
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:40.980]   We had to get like five or ten speakers to put them all around the room and up and down and everywhere because that was the only way to do
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.980]   Did you have quadrifonic?
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.180]   No, I just I missed that I missed that I did not do it
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.220]   You I'm sure you did something by the who
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:54.740]   Quadrifenia which was actually interestingly no, I better not go into this
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:49:04.740]   But they yeah, there was a joystick right and they could swirl the sound around. Oh, it was the only way to really understand the sound
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:10.100]   Quadrifonic my next door neighbor in the dorm had it and drove me completely daddy
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:17.780]   Yeah, the blast it to show the ladies how wonderful hysteria ladies my stereo is bigger than javices come over here
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:23.940]   The citation 500 has a 200 watt stereo speakers that's a lot
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:30.260]   And can support 24 bit 96 kilohertz high quality sound
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:36.900]   That's a high bit rate streaming and then a so it's a it's a speaker, you know
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:42.260]   There and then it has the assistant as well for control so it's not just for the google assistant
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:49.700]   It's the third smart speaker. I didn't realize this in the harmen card and said oh wait a minute. Yeah, I have the harden carmen that's based on cork ton
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:53.460]   Yeah, how's that go? How often you use that? Oh?
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:50:00.660]   It's kind of pathetic sitting there on the desk unplugged it's sad. It's well integrated with your google plus
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:07.940]   Hi, you know, I actually have a google mini that every time I go out of town. It's in our bathroom
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:13.380]   Um, it every time I go out of town it disappears and when I come back I find it. Look it back in
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.900]   Yeah, so I put cameras all around the house for while we're gone
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.980]   Uh, and they oddly enough they're all face down this morning
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.420]   Take care
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.900]   Every one of them face down so I put them back up. We'll see
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.740]   I need a camera that can get can write itself
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.860]   You know, oh like a little
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.940]   Like that robot we had a soccer play in robot in here on sunday
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:43.060]   That if it would sometimes miss the ball kick and kind of stirrically fall over
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:49.540]   And so but it but it's actually great when it does that because then it does this weird
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:54.020]   And stands up on its own. Oh awesome. It's like the beginning of the scene
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.380]   Yeah
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.620]   I use the wise camera for the cat to find out how it was peen. Yeah, it was doing the
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:05.380]   Yeah, of course the cat was freaked by it and bad at it. Yeah, I have video of that happening as well
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:11.620]   Cats love the wise cam. Did you know that as of 2011
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:16.180]   Google was still backing up gmail on tape
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.500]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.220]   Add a safe surprise me. Yeah, save their rub
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.860]   In 2011 if this is from the itriple e spectrum
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:29.220]   For example, I'm great for them. Do you?
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.940]   That's a great geeky boy. That's geek cred if you you write a column for them
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:39.700]   Yeah, that is geek cred. Wow. I wrote one piece for the ones. That's awesome. I wrote
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.740]   I just wrote a piece for the double arp magazine zeckeh
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:51.220]   That's that's a teaser credit, I guess
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:03.140]   2011 a flaw in a software update caused google to accidentally delete the saved email messages in about
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.940]   40,000 gmail accounts
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:12.100]   This loss occurred despite there being several copies of the data stored on hard drives across multiple data centers
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.300]   fortunately the data was also recorded on
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   tape
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.540]   And google eventually restored all the lost data
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.020]   from that backup
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.500]   Can we bet that it's not store on tape anymore?
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:29.460]   Well, wait actually so facebook started doing their cold storage research
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:35.620]   So this is I mean because tape is guys. It's reliable. It's cheap as anything
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:40.980]   So it makes it so this would be like amazon glacier cold storage is there's hot storage
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:43.780]   Which is like s3 and there's cold storage like glacier
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.300]   And yeah, why not use tape for cold storage. Why not?
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:51.460]   Well, no tape and cold storage are different so but cold storage the
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:58.260]   the cold storage efforts by facebook and amazon they didn't come out until they started researching those and like
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:04.420]   Probably earlier, but they didn't start like doing much with it until like 2014 maybe 2013
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:11.300]   So you got to remember in 2012 or 2011 when this happened. They didn't have anything like that
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.260]   So you had this is what they had. This is actually the tape machine
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.820]   Uh that they were using
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.740]   And yes, someone points out that tape does degrade
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:25.780]   Very fast, although it's it's about 20 30 years. I believe yeah
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:29.060]   I mean you're that's the thing is you're kind of refreshing it all the time a movie
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:34.420]   I'm sure they don't just take all of gmail put it on one tape and put in the closet. It's not like that
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.780]   Somewhere my email is from 2005 or in a
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:42.980]   Yeah, I mean and when did gmail come out? I know they just had a birthday. I think they just had a birthday
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:47.300]   When did that happen? Oh, I you know at least like 12 years old, right? Let's see. Okay
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.700]   Okay
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.140]   Oh, I muted it. That's right
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:58.340]   That's like that's what happens in my house all the time
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.580]   I was launched gmail april fools 2004
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.460]   And it was in beta for five years
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:13.540]   Remember that I remember in 2004 you had to get an invitation to get a gmail account and people were selling their invitations on ebay
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.580]   So yeah, I can't tell you my husband's email
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:21.540]   But it's it's a wonderful gmail because he actually was doing like he was a affiliate of googles
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:28.260]   They they when you're they sent us a tv they caught us it so I had an early gmail account because he's handy at gmail.com
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.900]   It is not that for Andy
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.660]   but yes
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:36.260]   There's a guy who has gym at aol.com
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.980]   But he can't use it
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:41.380]   It's completely swamped by spam
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:49.780]   You don't want you don't really like I have a loporta gmail. I actually had to abandon it because it's just not it's uh, I get too many french
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.140]   spam messages
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.300]   Oh, but the french spam messages are the best
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.060]   I know they're pretty funny
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:02.020]   Then I also get a lot of things like in french like your your appointment is
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:05.460]   Confirmative stuff because people
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:11.780]   Who are named loport they put their first name space loporta gmail.com and I get the mail not them
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:17.780]   And I stopped for a while. I was like, um, I'm sorry. I'm not that I'm not a meal a poor
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.420]   I'm not shot clipper and I finally just gave up
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:25.940]   That is a great story. I I bet you they're still using tape
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:30.420]   Oh, yeah, everybody still using tape everybody is really okay
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:36.420]   That would they say in journalism and also any true false test everybody never always okay
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:42.420]   A lot of people still use many many many people and companies. Oh, no
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.180]   What sorry to go back to her prior story trump just put up a meme. I don't know if I want to show it on his twitter
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:52.660]   Yeah video gosh. It's too bad. I don't have a twitter account. Don't attend to him stop
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:56.260]   Stop. Oh, yeah, let's stop. Let's not do it. It's true. It's what he wants to go. They can go
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.940]   Oh, my dog just barked at you jeff. She even agrees. She's like
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.980]   No, no meme for you
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:10.260]   Okay, now I feel like a mean person, but I don't even remember your Twitter handle anymore. So no stop you're looking you're feeding him
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:16.180]   Don't worry. It's Stacy's right as always so you as ever we talked last week about the pixel three
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:20.180]   And all the videos and leaks we found out we're apparently
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:27.300]   According to a nine to five google they found out where all those are coming from. There's a Ukrainian black market
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:34.100]   A dealer who somehow got his hands on quite a few see it's the russians everything is the russians
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:40.020]   No, hey across the border from Russia to Ukraine Ukraine is not Russia, dude. I don't know say it. It's right there
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:43.460]   I'll bet it. I'll bet it. It goes back. It's big. Oh, a lot of those
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:48.580]   teaser videos were showing Russian interfaces in syrolic. So
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.780]   uh, he's this this uh
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:54.260]   Seller is offering
[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:58.820]   Apparently, I don't know stolen pixel three xls for two thousand dollars each
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:06.740]   Where where does he already has his hands? Well, you better believe google's and hot hot high are wondering fox con
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:12.340]   Where but probably that's where right there making them in china somebody's
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:19.460]   Snarfing them up sneaking them out of the factory. Oh, I see that is no way in a home
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:28.420]   Oh, this was an interesting story for everybody who paid attention to the study on facebook causing anti-refugee attacks at Germany
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.940]   Yes
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:31.940]   There's a new teleconnection I hear
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.740]   Explain explain this to me. Stay. I enjoyed putting that one on there
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:44.260]   Um, I was wondering where that was from. No, I I'm sitting here reading it. So I'm I'm sorry
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:49.060]   I'm not so here is the introductory correlations anti-refugee posts
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:51.700]   That's the that's the dotted line
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:56.820]   Correlated with anti-refugee incidents look at the strong correlation
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.540]   uh between the two
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.100]   uh incidents and
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.300]   so uh
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.660]   Ben Thompson
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:07.220]   at who else Ben Thompson it's jutekery
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:09.620]   he uh
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:12.020]   He focused on a quotation from the authors
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:21.220]   In our setting the share of a municipality's population that use the afd facebook page is an intuitive proxy for right-wing social media use
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:27.060]   However, it is also correlated with differences in a host of observable municipality characteristics most importantly
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:34.020]   the prevalence a prevalence of right-wing ideology with us attempt to isolate the local component of social media usage that is
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.260]   Incorrelated with right-wing ideology by drawing
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:40.820]   on the number of users on the new tele germany page
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:47.140]   With over 32 million likes new tele has one of the most popular facebook pages in germany
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.780]   And therefore provides a measure of general facebook media use at the municipality level
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:56.900]   so so basically their benchmark for
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:05.140]   Their their statistical accuracy is based on yeah, how many people liked natella, but yeah because yeah
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:08.100]   Nutella is the normative
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.420]   Yes
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.340]   Which i think Nutella is disgusting so i'm like really
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:21.140]   Yeah, only surely only fascist like Nutella right Stacy. Mm. Yes. Yes. That is that is that is
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.860]   Yeah, that will be the only look at the tweets now. I will
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:30.580]   Yeah, see see again my strategy is turning out to be genius
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.380]   Genius
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:37.700]   Oh Nutella defenders for you. Mm-hmm. So this is a good
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:43.540]   Time to pitch one of my favorite books of all time that will help everyone and it's called a math
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:49.060]   Matician reads the newspaper. Oh, it's very dry. I thought you were gonna say weapons of math destruction
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:55.540]   No, no, this is this is written for journalists. Oh, this is written for people who don't like math
[00:59:56.180 --> 01:00:03.220]   In general, so it's it's a lovely book and I highly recommend it for people who want to be
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:08.660]   You know a little bit smarter. There are equations. You don't have to deal with the equations. You could just get right on Alan
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:15.060]   It's available. It's our daughter. Yes, oh it's john. I'm polos. I know him
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:21.540]   I know john. I'm polis. He wrote in numeracy, which is another wonderful book. Mm-hmm. I actually have interviewed him
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:27.700]   Nice. Yeah. Yeah, I talked to him like a friend when a numeracy came out. Yeah
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.660]   he he
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:33.780]   likens a numeracy to illiteracy except with numbers
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.900]   Yes. Oh nice
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.620]   And in this he talks he gives wonderful examples
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.100]   He talks about how scientific papers and
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:46.980]   Polsters and all sorts of people like remember the study about how alcohol will kill you
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:51.220]   I drink a day is going to kill you, you know, if you look at the actual statistics your
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.820]   The it's not as much fun though stacy
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:58.900]   I I know I'm just saying that you know the first thing when that came out
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:04.180]   I found somebody who actually reported the data and then I was like read that and I was like oh, okay
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.540]   I don't need to be
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:10.340]   truthiness through statistics as uh, midwest in our chatroom says
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:16.260]   Would you like to uh, shall I do we have a changelog today? I believe
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.340]   We do
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.260]   Oh, we do. Oh, yes. I am
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:21.620]   Um
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.620]   It's not easy
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:26.900]   It takes some time
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.860]   To find new stuff from google because back in the day when jina trapani was doing this
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:36.420]   Google seemed to be running out new stuff all the time they haven't really as much
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:41.220]   But here is the tenth doodle for google winner
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:49.380]   Okay, i'm telling you I
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:53.300]   It's not easy doing a changelog every week
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.860]   Uh, this is those listening
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:04.500]   How do you describe this google google? Well, maybe if I explain that google, uh, uh, asked
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.540]   uh students to respond to the theme of
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:15.620]   Uh, uh, uh, what ins uh, it's what inspires me uh in the winner first grader sarah go mezzling
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:23.700]   I'll give you google's description of it delightful dinosaurs to highlight her dream of becoming a paleontologist
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.700]   She was the k-3 finalist and the virginia state winner
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:34.340]   And uh, we asked google writes how she felt upon hearing she was a finalist she exclaimed she was
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.660]   surprised
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:40.900]   Her advice to students interested in submitting to future doodle for google contests
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:45.860]   Try your best and have fun. She's the uh first on the left and the front
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.740]   Uh, this big award ceremony
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:54.980]   18th google, okay, i'm sure I have some other things in the changelog
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.940]   Uh, actually this is a serious one
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.580]   Uh, there are a lot of veterans working at google not a surprise
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:05.940]   And uh, google has decided to help us veterans find jobs to suit their skills by
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.700]   Adding new search a new search term search
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:14.100]   jobs for veterans in google and you can use your military job code
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:21.140]   mosafsc and ec to narrow down the job listings to those needing the skills you hone in the military
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:27.140]   So there's a new jobs for veterans search term. I think that's a really nice thing
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.980]   Let's go helping veterans make their next move in civilian life
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.260]   And the uh, the blog post came from matthew hudson
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.740]   Who's a program manager at google cloud for seven years? I served in the air force as a civil engineer
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:42.020]   My job was to make sure our bases like the ones in arachina
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.700]   Afghanistan where I did three tours of duty were technologically and logistically
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:51.220]   Prepared for my fellow service men and women to do their duty in defense of our country. I think that's awesome
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.180]   I think it's really awesome
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:57.300]   Uh, let's see. So there you go. There's something good
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:07.860]   Uh google go search for emerging markets can now read website content out loud
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.860]   I'm excited by this one. This is the google go is the later version
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.660]   Of android and it is for developing markets, but what what I I think is
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:20.500]   Potentially true here is a redefining of the definition of literacy
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:24.660]   Literacy in the get ready for your drinks folks gutenberg era
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.820]   Was all text based right now literacy can also be aural
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.780]   And you can hear and I think that there's an honor
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:36.500]   So it's going to make web pages more accessible to more people and yes it yes folks
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.300]   It's an effort to expand the internet into new places and get new people on and make more money for them
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.380]   Of course, that's the way the rolok writes
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:48.100]   But I think it's a good thing. I think I think it brings information and knowledge to more people
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.900]   Hindi
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.100]   English and other actually 28 supported languages
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:59.940]   And what's cool is it reads the text on the page and highlights the word as it's going
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:06.100]   So it is in fact, I think a way to teach real literacy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. Did I say real?
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.660]   Good
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:16.740]   Actually, it's interesting because these are basically the google goes supposed to run on pretty simple low-cost phones
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.140]   So the fact they can do this is
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:21.220]   impressive
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.220]   I would I would imagine it's local
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:28.020]   Yeah, I would think so because you can't kind of base it with either right all right
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.700]   and uh, well, we're we were down to the
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:35.700]   The last item on the google change log
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:42.420]   If you use gboard and I know a lot of you do on your google device, I guess you could use gboard on an iphone too
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.300]   Google is now offering mini stickers
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.900]   emojis it creates from your selfies
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:54.020]   The feature uses a combination of machine learning neural networks and artis
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:06:01.860]   Illustrations to conjure up the best res presentation of you. Can you get my I left my pixel on the desk? I should be showing this
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:09.380]   uh taking into account various characteristics like skin tone hair color style eye color face shape and facial hair
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.860]   The sticker pack
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:18.740]   Oh, here's an animation you can see creates a hundred sticker styles based on your personal have a personalized avatar with bold or sweet modes
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.420]   Which I'm thinking stacy's bold and jeff is sweet
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.540]   Aww
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:29.300]   It's not out yet and might I'm just want to check on my pixel to uh
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.740]   Gboard version 7.5
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.940]   Just came out. So let me just see
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:41.140]   If I can do this because I do use gboard. I like gboard
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:44.580]   Let me send a message to somebody
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.020]   Uh send one to my lovely wife
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:51.860]   Now, how do I make it?
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.020]   Uh
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.020]   Let me watch the video
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:04.820]   What is she doing? Okay, it's creating the mini. Okay customize. That's bold or sweet. Okay, so you pick stickers. Oh, okay
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.620]   And then yeah, I don't think I have it yet
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:10.900]   I don't see a create
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.820]   No
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:17.860]   But you will at some point maybe we all will google look for gboard 7.5
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.900]   and that
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.220]   It's not changed there such as it is
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.100]   Not I admit the most exciting
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:29.140]   But sometimes there's nothing to say
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:34.820]   Our show today brought to you by now this i'm excited about masterclass. I am a big fan
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:41.620]   Of masterclass if we talked about masterclass on uh on this show before we have indeed and big fans. Yeah
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.580]   so masterclass
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:47.220]   Is you know takes this idea of online learning?
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:52.980]   But gives you the most amazing teachers you've ever heard of there's
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.380]   world chess champion gary kasparov teaching chess or
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:00.260]   Any leap of its teaching photography?
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.980]   Steph curry teaching you had a dunk
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:08.340]   And these are by the way shot beautifully ron howard opie
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:11.140]   Did you know he's a director now?
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.380]   he teaches a
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:18.580]   He teaches direction and and look how they do this. I mean they're really showing the shots
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:23.540]   They're showing the angles. They're showing you exactly what a professional real director
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:28.580]   Does I love it that people like ron howard who certainly doesn't need the money
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:34.260]   Actually asked the masterclass. I mean people what are you how do you get these how do you get these amazing people do your classes?
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:40.580]   They said because they want to pay it forward because they actually like the idea of telling teaching people what they know
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.100]   the role
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.860]   of the director
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:44.900]   So
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:50.500]   And let you watch me work with the actors and action. I thought today was a huge improvement
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.900]   Are you nuts? I played with each other. Are you nuts?
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:59.540]   You know a beat of looking this way. How did the courage to how do you like to learn how to act from Samuel L. Jackson?
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:03.700]   This is this is my other favorite one. I always pull this one up because I love it
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.100]   uh, he walks
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.980]   Actors through a scene in uh pulp fiction
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:12.180]   Bit by bit and helps them understand
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.820]   You know the motivation what's going on
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.300]   personality quirks that are
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:26.500]   We're gonna do this iconic scene from pulp fiction when you're at home preparing to break down what he's trying to convey
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:32.900]   The person he's speaking to and to the audience. It's true. They now some people would want to watch this because they want to become actors
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:36.660]   But frankly, I just find this amazingly entertaining
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:41.620]   What is he saying? I'm the evil of the world and I have dominion over you
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:44.100]   Isn't that awesome
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:49.460]   Look at some of the people now we have a deal for you that you're gonna love you can unlock every masterclass

[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.140]   I think originally when they started this they figured oh well every you know people will be interested in just one thing like
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:26.260]   Oh, you want to learn how to cook so you're gonna watch the wolf gang puk
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:33.460]   You know cooking class, but it I think that the way I use it is exactly how people use it. It's just great
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.900]   It's just fun. You don't you don't I don't want to be a chef
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.900]   But I love hearing wolf gang puk talk about how he thinks about cooking
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:47.300]   Many different recipes presentation how to really make
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.060]   something happen
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.060]   I'm never going to cook like puk
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:54.420]   So i'm never going to play tennis like serena williams
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.980]   That's for sure
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:01.380]   But I love watching these masterclass.com/twig
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.340]   Incidentally, this would be a great gift
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:09.540]   A great gift for a young person. I was going to give this henry's birthday was yesterday's 24th birthday
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:13.380]   I was going to give it to him. He said i already have a dad. He bought it for himself
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:16.100]   Okay
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.540]   Every class includes video lessons
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.580]   But also workbooks even office hours where you can submit your questions
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.820]   uh
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:31.700]   I can't sing the praises highly enough. There's an app you can get on the iphone or the ipad
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:36.340]   You can also do it on the web go to masterclass.com/twig
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:40.740]   Ken burns teaching documentary filmmaking
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:43.700]   Chris Hadfield
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.500]   Commander Hadfield teaching space exploration
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:51.780]   I don't think i'm going to mars but if I were man, I'd be taking Chris with me
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:58.980]   But the moment that you're in study every system on a spaceship and then boil it down to what I call a one pager
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:04.100]   So really this is as much a document. Honestly, I think these are just great documentaries beautifully shot
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.740]   Great information, but they are also classes
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:13.140]   Masterclass.com/twig i'm sorry this I could go on and on just showing clips from this. It's so much fun
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:18.980]   Here's any leap of its teaching photography. They should do one with you. I
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.620]   am yeah, well
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:25.300]   They haven't asked
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:30.820]   I'm not standing by the phone waiting for the call masterclass.com/twig
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:35.460]   I just it's my kind of I don't know I think if you watch some of our shows you probably are the kind of person that would love this
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.940]   It's my kind of thing
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.940]   um
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:48.180]   I guess we could talk about this fortnight installer thing now the uh, tim swine the ceo of fortnight's blaming google
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.740]   for the fact that their launcher
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:54.180]   Insta could be used for malware
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:13:00.980]   Uh actually it's an interesting question. So this is we've talked about this before fortnight decided to
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:05.700]   Bypass the google play store something they couldn't do on apple. They've made 150 million dollars
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:10.340]   On the apple play store for this game this battle royale game on ios
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:15.540]   150 million dollars well they didn't make that much they that's how much revenue came in apple took a third
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.740]   So they only made 100 million
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:25.300]   So when it came time to go on android they thought well, we don't have to go through the play store like apple makes us
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.500]   So they did a side load which at the time I thought
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:35.140]   Boy, you know, you're you're jeopardizing your user's security so you can make more money that the optics of that if nothing else are
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:43.700]   Bad well now and as we mentioned last we could turned out that the fortnight installer they initially put out allowed a kind of uh app in the middle attack
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:48.020]   It was a two-part download the first part allowed any app on your phone
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:52.260]   To download a malicious app
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.540]   Google disclosed
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:01.700]   Uh epic game says that's irresponsible they're doing it because they're they're mad at us
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:04.660]   Because we didn't go through the store
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:11.140]   You know, I got a I know I tend to side with the platforms on this one i'm side in the google too because you know, well
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:13.780]   go around us and
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:16.420]   But also users and also
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:22.580]   I think that they needed to do this because it was a it was a live vulnerability
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:27.620]   Uh epic fixed it was already out. Yeah epic fixed it within two hours
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:32.980]   Uh normally what would have happened is there's a 90 day
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:40.980]   Responsible disclosure window where google would go to epic say before we published this and this probably should have done this before we published this
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:44.420]   We're gonna give you a chance to fix it since it only took them two hours
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.780]   Uh
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:54.100]   Google security team apparently according to the register turned down epic's 90 day request to publish the information one week after the patch
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.340]   Oh, well the patch was already out
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:58.100]   Okay
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:03.940]   Google did report the issued epic which immediately started working on a patch put one out uh one day layer
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:11.700]   Two hours after informing google that it published the fix epic security team asked google to the lay publication of the issue report for 90 days
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:15.220]   Oh
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:19.220]   Why would why would they want to wait 90 days after the patch was out
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:23.460]   Google published one week after the patch
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.460]   Um
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.540]   I
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.940]   I'm not sure uh what's going on. I
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:38.820]   It seems like I don't it feels like google's trying to do the best thing for its users. I think so that'd be my guess
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:42.740]   And a little bit of shot and for it to hear like
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:47.060]   Exactly why uh, we thought it was a bad idea
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:49.620]   Yeah
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:54.900]   We're here to protect users when you have users side load stuff and you make millions of users do that you're making millions of
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.180]   Small, you know young unsophisticated users
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:04.820]   vulnerable now here's one that uh google doesn't look so good on we talked before about the privacy issue
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:09.940]   uh a research paper published by professor doug was spent at vanderbolt university
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:18.420]   Says that androids sucks 10 times more private data from you than your iphone, but how do you come up with it multiple like that?
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.420]   you know
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.660]   Showing me naked
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:28.420]   Versus, you know 10 times you put my location in that's a good point. Which one is 10 times worse?
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:32.740]   That doesn't yeah, I don't think the data points are not the issue. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.060]   Um
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.780]   Okay qualitative issue. I don't know it could be worse
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:43.860]   I don't know but but don't argue with it. Why not natively argue with it qualitatively. What's more harm to you? Right
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:50.420]   Yeah, you're right 10 times, but I have to think that
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.340]   Apple doesn't suck as much of your private data in general
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:58.340]   That's a good question
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:01.300]   Oh, that's why she's so quiet
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.380]   Oh, I thought we were just boring you
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:06.740]   Yeah, she thought we were ignoring her. No Stacy. We were not
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:10.260]   I couldn't be a strong silent type
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:15.620]   No, I was my dog had started barking while you were talking jeff and I wanted it to not be
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.180]   Yeah, she told me again. Yep
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.820]   No, no family just came home
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:24.340]   What is gonna be running? I want to say something about about this
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:28.820]   I just forgot. Oh my gosh. This is just terrible. All right. I got one
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:31.140]   remember
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:33.140]   IG TV
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.980]   Remember that?
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:35.780]   Nope
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.780]   Instagram TV was like a month ago
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.100]   Go for that
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:41.860]   What happened?
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.180]   It's still there. Is that the boomerang thing?
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.900]   No, the one no
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:51.540]   It's the one where creators are supposed to make long form at the two-hour videos
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:59.620]   Right on a special application horizontal vertical videos on a special application not instagram, but i g tv
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:03.380]   Ah
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:08.260]   John Constein running on 10 crunch a couple of days ago instagram has never truly failed at anything
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:16.260]   But judging by modest initial view counts i g tv could get stuck with a reputation as an abandoned theater if the company isn't careful
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.900]   It's kind of like
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.060]   IG plus
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.420]   Yeah
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.420]   Two months after i g tv's launch
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:28.580]   Facebook is not saying anything about uptake
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.820]   Um
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.660]   It's a new Kevin systrom that you found her in ceo at instagram
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:39.620]   It's an i like kevin a lot and i love instagram even though i just dumped it. It's a new format
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:43.300]   It's different we have to wait for people to adopt it and that takes time
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.860]   The problem is you've got all these creators who are deciding should i
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:54.820]   Take the energy and time to make something on i g tv or should i just put it on youtube or even just instagram
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.620]   And if there aren't a lot of views
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:01.540]   They're just gonna walk away
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:12.500]   Yeah, creating a marketplace is terrible whether it's a marketplace for content or just you know here's sensor tower data
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:18.980]   Starting June 18th when the i g tv came out weekly installs kind of a precipitous drop
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:25.300]   It's hard i mean how many apps do you have on your phone? Yeah
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:29.380]   Yeah, it is hard your terrible example for this i have thousands
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:36.340]   But i have three less now that i've dumped instagram twitter and facebook and tumblr four or less
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:42.820]   I i won't say any i'll stop talking about it. I'm just they're gonna send you at let me track how many emails
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:47.140]   They send you asking for you to come back no, oh really you think i will get some
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:54.020]   I could email like i just stopped using it and i sti i could get emails i don't i stop reading emails so
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:59.060]   And they they get increasingly more desperate they're like stacey you haven't been on instagram in a while
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:05.140]   Stacy what can we do to bring you back to instagram? This is an app i might get we should have added this to the changelog
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.140]   It's not from google. It's from nasa
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.540]   nasa selfies
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:13.460]   The nasa selfies app let's you generate snapchat

[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:12.340]   Like mars has read you ask it a question and it will go on for like hours
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:21.540]   Yes, we've showed before there's spacecraft a our app which puts space, you know, like the mars rover on your desktop. All right, wait a minute. Okay, nasa
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:26.180]   Somebody's gonna tell them
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:32.740]   Okay before using nasa selfies take a moment to read our yeah, right right allow allow

[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:15.700]   Update or you can ask random that's on the amazon echo
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:19.380]   Yes, all right, so I need that i'm gonna get a better picture of myself
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.300]   That's better
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:24.900]   That's much better

[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:12.020]   Craig new mark
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.780]   He's at it again
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:19.540]   He is indeed my friend craig our friend craig just gave mother jones a left-wing
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.580]   Publication I might add
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:26.020]   $1 million to fight fake news good for you craig
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:31.860]   Yep, and full disclosure. I know i'm professor at the craig new mark graduate school of journalism. Thanks to craig's general
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.900]   He's actually the Leonard tau professor for your lives to get a message
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:40.420]   We're gonna have craig on the show and I I forgot to sorry. I'll when's he gonna be on the show connection?
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.900]   But so is your back well a little range of
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.860]   Better be after I return
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:51.220]   So awesome. No, I don't have to be here. You could do it with Jason be here
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:56.500]   Mother Jones is nonprofit focuses on investigative reporting. It is absolutely
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:03.060]   It is really good. I love it. Yeah, that is the magazine that I dreamed of working for
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:06.740]   When I started as a journalist as a little baby journalist
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.700]   Oh that rolling stone, you know
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:13.940]   You I guess I could post this on google plus
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:16.660]   ha
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:23.300]   But it does kind of bring home the fact that a lot of these sorts of things are just silly ways to get you to share
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:26.820]   Oh, absolutely. There's there. They're not okay
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:30.580]   I know it's okay. It's
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:33.700]   Do you still have my space? All right, I put it up on my google plus
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:43.620]   Do you literally do you still have my space? I have I will tune it later. Yeah, but here. It's not super high res
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:46.100]   Frankly, I'm a little disappointed
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.180]   Come on JPL
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.220]   Come on
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.980]   Supercomputers to use the heck
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:54.980]   Let's get those puppies transcoding. I think it's fairly realistic though
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:25:00.020]   That's exactly how I would look if I were floating around the christmas tree cluster in a space suit
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:04.900]   All right, so
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.700]   I'm a master of
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:11.700]   The selfie on google plus
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.700]   I
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:18.100]   You pathetic I'm pathetic
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:23.940]   We we did I think we this is like I think we've done everything
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:31.300]   Singing. Oh, yeah, you have a sorry you go catch your plane man. No, no, no, no, no, I was gonna say i got plenty of time
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:36.580]   How about Toyota investing half a billion dollars in uber? What about that, huh?
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:40.740]   Making the ride sharing company worth
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:46.340]   It's or valued. I guess shouldn't say worth valued at 72 billion dollars
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:53.060]   So it's interesting isn't it toyota obviously interested in the driverless car stuff
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:26:00.340]   Which is funny because wasn't wasn't there a noise that uber was gonna drop its driverless car research or we're
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:04.740]   Wasn't the board or something saying let's you guys should get out of that. Yeah
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:11.780]   See mekonomical so that is a little strange. Uh, well you got another half billion. Maybe it's more economical than you thought
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:19.380]   I don't know. I mean did you see the information article and the difficulties of way. Oh, yeah, which was hilarious and very true
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:23.780]   Well, but then there's also uh benedict. Oh, what's his name the vc benedict
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:26.420]   Cumberbatch. I love him. No
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:28.580]   Evans
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:34.420]   Evan benedivents. He so he tweeted and he said everyone he knows in autonomous vehicle world says
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:38.580]   This is years off. We're just working and so all these darn stories. It's more
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:44.660]   Technopanic. Oh my god. It's not ready to take over the world. No, nobody who knows what they're talking about is saying that it is
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:50.900]   They're doing waymo tests of the of the christmas specific event in uh, Arizona
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:52.740]   and uh
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.740]   the suburban phoenix and apparently
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:27:01.460]   Uh, the waymo vehicles are a little hesitant sometimes they'll like enter in intersection and pause and stop
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:03.780]   Which supposed to barely and throw in killing
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:10.980]   Exactly and and it's bothering the humans. I love this. This is amira friday writing at the information two weeks ago
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:16.580]   Lisa hargis an administrative assistant who works at an office a stone's throw from waymo's vehicle depot
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:20.900]   Said she nearly hid a waymo christler pacifica minivan
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:24.900]   Because it stopped abruptly while making a right turn in an intersection
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:30.980]   Go she shouted angrily. She said after getting stuck in an intersection midway through a left turn
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:36.900]   Cars had been driving behind the waymo also stopped. I was gonna murder someone she said
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:42.980]   And the cars are the problem. Well indeed go down to the numbers
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:47.220]   Uh excessive under excessive optimism
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:54.260]   Oh, yeah numbers. Yes axio says one big thing people cause most autonomous
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:56.660]   Vehicle accidents
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:02.100]   And you look at the chart there is one accident in california caused by the thomas thonomas vehicle
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.620]   the
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:10.180]   Six accidents caused by autonomous vehicles were caused by the person driving it at the time manually
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:17.940]   The waymo vehicle of friday writes is generally programmed to follow every rolled rule precisely that may mean stopping for at least
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.940]   Three seconds at a stop sign
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:22.180]   whether human drivers like it or not
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:24.980]   And turning on its blinkers
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.060]   Well before it makes a lane change
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:33.220]   So you could see that the problem is that people are rear-ending think because it's not
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:38.980]   It's not just actually following the law stopping in a st- how dare you stop on a stop sign
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:45.780]   Well, it looks like in some of these cases it's pausing in a way that people are not anticipating to right right
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:51.460]   Well probably also states you that that example though wasn't the lady like starting to barge into the intersection
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:56.020]   So it was cautiously saying uh-oh. Yes. She might hit me. I better stop right?
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.900]   Well, no, I think it was more a function of
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:04.740]   The I mean having been behind people who drive this way drives me absolutely nuts
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:10.100]   You're like, oh, they're going it's a it's a you know left her nyield kind of situation
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:16.420]   You're just like you make the commitment you go and you're ready to keep going so you can also get in before those cars
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:18.020]   And so we don't want to be timid
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:21.620]   Attempt driver sometimes is more of a problem than an aggressive driver
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:25.300]   Especially if they're surrounded by aggressive drivers
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:29.460]   One of the problems drives at the speed limit
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:36.500]   Yeah, yeah that drives people cra- I so when I drive at the speed limit, I feel like i'm a hazard
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:40.260]   People come right up to your butt and go hmm
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:47.140]   And so I always now drive seven my I set my uh my tesla to drive seven miles above the speed limit
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:52.260]   Because I figure you're not going to get a speeding ticket, but people won't be so nutty
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:55.780]   Right are always nutty
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:30:00.100]   So one of the problems the waymo has according to mere is the zoolander problem
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:05.380]   Like the movie character zoolander waymo's minivans have issues turning left
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:08.580]   Specifically unprotected left turns
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:12.660]   That's when a left turn ning vehicle, you know, it doesn't have the right of way
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:17.780]   There's oncoming traffic and in places where there are no left turn lanes the vans just like human drivers
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:23.540]   Get confused by drivers in oncoming traffic who don't turn on their blinkers to signal
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:26.340]   Whether they'll take a left turn a continue straight and some drivers
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:31.060]   Makes such wide turns in front of the waymo vans the vans react defensively
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:34.260]   So it's the humans
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:36.180]   We're terrible
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:41.060]   Vans get confused if they approach a line of cars in the road waiting their turn to enter a driveway
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:43.540]   Such as malls or other busy retailers
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:46.740]   Confused means I guess what they stop
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:51.700]   Well, it's try yeah, confused like it's trying to parse the situation
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:55.300]   And it doesn't want to just do something until it understands the situation
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:58.500]   So that means it pauses and that drives humans nuts
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:05.620]   Barreling ahead is probably not a great plan. Yeah, I think it's this is we you know what there's going to have to be some
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:11.300]   Acclement act harmonization of the humans not just as riders, but also as drivers
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:15.780]   That there will be these like think of them as like student drivers
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:21.540]   A friday says it's like student drivers. They're very very good student drivers, but they're a little cautious
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:29.140]   So you just got more patient you become normative driving and and does it does it hold to a flow
[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:35.460]   And and and and and do you have an indemnification against them the law says yeah
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:41.620]   It's safer for you to actually violate the law than it is for you not to yeah because they could they could program it that way easily
[01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:45.860]   They could program what stay in the flow, especially once they're all communicating with each other
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:52.500]   That's the thing once you get the humans out this thing that's going to be the other side of this is they're going to be whizzing around like crazy
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:57.300]   Because they know because you don't have to worry if the car is got a blinker on or not
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:59.460]   You know exactly what the car is going to do. Oh, yeah, he's gone
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:06.820]   Well, that's not true. I often pause when people have their blinkers on because a lot of people in Texas
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:11.060]   They just drive with their blinkers on fake really that's more dangerous
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:16.740]   Yes, soon they're turning and they plow right into you. I never assume. I'm just like yeah
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:23.380]   This person could just be high drunk who knows so lisa son is 15 and a half
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:30.100]   So we're kind of trying to model good driving and that's one of the things lisa's really good
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.820]   She's saying okay, and I see that guy backing out of the driveway
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:40.180]   Do you think he sees me and really kind of talking through these decisions that we unconsciously make but michael has to learn how to make
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:46.100]   And and it is a lot of good driving is very defensive driving people are terrible. Yeah
[01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:50.740]   Yeah, my mom used it my mom actually she used to like don't look at your mirrors
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.940]   Who's behind you? What colors the car, you know, she would just quiz me
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:01.380]   It was it was really useful. That's great. I'm gonna try that I learned. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:06.020]   All right, let's take a break and uh, we'll wrap things up and then I will
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:14.740]   I thought how many better coins waiting for me along with a nice big glass of thank ria
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:20.180]   Our show today brought to you by our new messaging platform
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:22.900]   Every it's so interesting
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:29.140]   Everybody in the studio is saying when is what is when are we converting because we've been using hip chat hip chat got acquired in some
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:37.940]   Confusing deal with by slack and hip chat's gonna be replaced by slack. We were using hip chat, but we had used slack before it uh
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:40.580]   when we did the website
[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:43.140]   And then it turned out I didn't know this but Megan
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:49.700]   And Jason had secretly been using slack for some time to coordinate their news show
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:54.340]   Because people love slack and uh, and so now everybody's saying okay when
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:34:00.100]   Faying yesterday, I can't download hip chat anymore. Yes, you can. No, I can't I need slack
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:08.660]   Slack is a collaboration hub for whatever work you do with slack the right people in your team are kept in the loop
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.660]   It's so much better than email
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:15.540]   Information you need is always at your fingertips the teamwork happens in channels
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:22.660]   Letting you organize conversations and information around teams projects offices whatever you want
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:29.780]   People who drink tea not coffee whatever you want and then everything you need is in one place
[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:33.300]   It's faster and easier to get things done. We did look at alternatives and of course
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.940]   Uh, you know, there are lots of alternatives out there
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:41.620]   Everybody wants to be slack, but nobody really quite is slack. I asked Russell. Well, what do you need?
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:45.700]   And we had I think seven or eight integrations. He absolutely had to have
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:50.580]   uh applications that we use including Atlassian's Jira and confluence
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.300]   We needed uh
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:59.140]   uh, pan opta which keeps an eye on our servers and and slack does it slack integrates with more than
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.140]   1000 apps
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:05.380]   Salesforce zendesk google drive you can make slack
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:09.460]   Be your central hub of everything you do
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:15.620]   No more searching through emails for that follow-up or searching through multiple systems to find what you're looking
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:21.940]   For you don't have to switch across multiple tabs and platforms to keep updated. It's all there. It's secure
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:30.660]   It's fast. It's easy and it's fun and I don't want to I think you shouldn't deprecate that notion either people want to use it
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:34.900]   You can have another solution and if people don't use it who cares
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:39.700]   People love slack with slack your team is better connected
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:43.220]   Learn more at slack slac.com
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:50.100]   Stuart Butterfield, uh, this was his his startup after he sold flicker off right to uh, yahoo
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:54.660]   And man did he do it right? He learned quite a few lessons. He's mopped
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:59.700]   You know, I think it was his third startup initially they were gonna do a game and then then they made it to flicker
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:03.300]   And then he sold that and this is an awesome awesome job
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:07.380]   slack.com we thank slack for their support
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:10.580]   And we uh, we're all very excited about
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:16.180]   Moving over to are you gonna have a slack group for us for the show you bet? Of course
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:20.100]   Yeah, do you like slack? Will you use it? Yes? I do I do
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:23.700]   I think I've never made anybody doesn't like slack. No
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:29.460]   It's kind of a time waster. That's the only complaint you ever hear is it's too is too much fun
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:34.580]   But you could control that when we were doing we were doing the website we had I mentioned this before
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.740]   A plug-in that anytime you said that's nice, which I apparently say a lot
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:44.420]   Maybe they were trying to get me to stop saying that I would say that's nice and a borat picture would show up
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:46.500]   It would say that's nice
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:50.500]   In fact it worked because I stopped saying that
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:55.140]   So maybe that was the point the thing I did love is we had an alex trebek bot
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:58.180]   And I could just say alex let's play jeopardy
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:08.180]   So if you yeah, if you're worried about productivity you might want to leave those integrations out, but there's lots of useful
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.260]   stuff
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:14.980]   Jeff actually let's start with uh with stacey at her uh her thing of the week
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:20.900]   My thing of the week is okay. Are you guys ready for this? It is a smart olive oil bottle
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:24.180]   Oi how smart is it? Oi?
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:31.780]   It's pretty smart. Um, it's actually not that smart. Okay, so this is a I think it's a 60 dollar bottle
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:34.100]   um
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.420]   And you guys are looking at it. Yeah, so uh
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.460]   roof roof thing about it. I know
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:44.820]   It's like okay guys. Okay. Uh, so the cool thing is it is designed
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:49.780]   With glass so it's it's darker. So your oil doesn't get
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:53.060]   Have a lot of light hit it, which is bad for your olive oil
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:59.300]   Um, and then it's a refill program. So when you're 80 through your wall olive oil
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:01.380]   Oh, jesus
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:03.380]   Which you're like
[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:10.980]   This is the jesus of olive oil bottle. Yeah. Yeah, so then you so then you for 12 bucks
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:15.140]   You get a refill and a bag you get off all over the bag
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:21.940]   Well, that's actually kind of nice because that's easier to ship. I am a pro bag and you just stick it in there
[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:26.100]   Yeah, that's a good point. Um, that's less. We can imagine this powerpoint that proposed this
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:31.140]   They have a small they're Dutch though, which is not known as an olive oil nation
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:34.340]   so
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:36.340]   Yeah, I mean
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:41.220]   This is more this is not something I would buy and I use a lot of olive oil
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:43.860]   but if you know
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.740]   You're interested
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:51.940]   Can I show you can I show you my pick of the week?
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:57.060]   Oh sure. Yeah, you put the olive oil in these squeeze bottles
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.940]   They're about a buck each
[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:05.780]   They're it was Kenji Lopez. Oh, these are actually awesome and you know what you do what this is
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:11.860]   This is the pro tip everyone on the side mark out your favorite dressing recipes
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:19.380]   So like a quarter cup of olive oil, you know half a you nail it lemon juice and then you shake them up
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.660]   Yep
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:25.140]   I have I you buy these a dozen at a shot. You know, like a buck each
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:29.780]   I have one next to the stove that's filled with that delicious olive oil. We have a sponsor
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:32.580]   That's an olive oil sponsor trace buntas and it's really good
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:35.940]   So I keep that there and then I have another one that is my vinaigrette
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:41.300]   Which is balsamic olive oil a little de jon mustard salt and pepper
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:44.500]   You shake it up and I squirt it on everything
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.300]   It's fabulous
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.460]   Fabulous so in
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.380]   Then you do the recipe though on the side
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:55.220]   And then people can make it when you're out. Oh that's smart
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:39:58.980]   Isn't that so like you're no longer the dressing key like in my house
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:02.580]   I'm the only person like Stacy. Could you could you whip up some of your hazelnut dressing?
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:03.700]   Yeah, I'm like
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:08.340]   I have a dressing I make with instead of olive oil. I use cashews
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:13.540]   You soak them and then you put them in the um, Vitamix and it liquefies them in cashew milk
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:16.420]   Yeah, it makes it a popular vegan cream
[01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:22.660]   I'm serious you that's like half the steps of a vegan queso right there
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:25.780]   Oh, you had me at queso
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:29.860]   Vegan I said vegan queso so there's no cheese
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:32.820]   Right. It's cashew cream
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.500]   How does it taste?
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:37.940]   I think that's the case. Oh, I think that's why you have to loop move to Seattle
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:44.260]   Because you're not allowed to be in Texas anymore because you violated queso statute number one. Wait. There's a popular vegan
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:46.340]   queso
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:49.620]   It may not be as bad as you know chipotle queso
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:53.380]   Yeah, well, nothing's as bad as chocolate queso
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:41:00.260]   All right, thank you Stacy. You know, Stacy. I want your bottle. What your bottle should come with any brains is gin
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:02.740]   Ah, now you're talking
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:11.620]   I would love that I would love the mail order gin
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:17.060]   Unfortunately, blue laws make that difficult. Oh, yeah, you're probably in a state where you can't get that kind of thing
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.300]   I can't ship alcohol here for anything
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:23.140]   Everything goes you can ship pot you can ship anything
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:28.580]   You know when I have this awesome gin and I can't get it delivered to me. It's from Utah and I'm like sucks
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:33.140]   God, what's the name of it? I'll have it delivered to me and then drink it for you
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:38.100]   Excellent. That's a great plan. Um, it's called a it's by
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:44.660]   Beehive distillery. It's called jack rabbit gin if you guys can take like get it. Oh, it's amazing gin
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:51.380]   I had a really good. I didn't have it, but I just sniffed the my drinking colleagues gin and buenos Aires
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:58.260]   It's local gin. It's really wonderful spell. So, uh, is it the combination of botanicals? It makes this so good
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:01.460]   It is it is a really delicious
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:08.340]   It is a juniper forward, but it's also kind of sweet. Oh, it's a it's a nice mix. It's not like
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:12.740]   It's good for a gnt. It actually is amazing in an aviation
[01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:20.580]   So, oh, I love an aviation and you know what else it's good in what? South side, which we've been drinking a lot here in texas. Oh
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:24.020]   What would a south side be?
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:30.260]   It is three quarters cup or three quarters cup three quarters of an ounce of simple three quarters lime juice
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:33.140]   submit leaves and two ounces of gin. Oh
[01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:37.700]   Okay, easy. That's like an aviator. That's similar to an aviator
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:46.980]   Uh, I was talking about an aviation an aviation. Yeah, no an aviation is lemon juice creme de violet and oh gin and
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:50.420]   Can you come to my house and I will get the beehive?
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:53.620]   If you'll make the salad dressing
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:58.020]   Excellent done done
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:02.660]   Mr. Jeffrey javis you have a number for us. Yeah, we're giving them all away already
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:06.500]   But I've got one I got one thanks to miss stacey he can broth him. Oh, yeah
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:10.100]   He was thinking of me on twitter and I'm grateful
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:16.020]   And I said oh as soon as I saw it from you didn't get very helpful
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:23.540]   Who says that the l to the pixel book two could end up having lte which is what i've been wanting to have
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:27.380]   I love this from kevin's post on about chromebooks
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:35.140]   During my daily scan of the fcc database today. Oh, no, that's hard for john house. Yeah
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:40.340]   So he's from across that's that'd be really nice. I'd like that if I can take my my
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:46.820]   Combination laptop tablet whatever the heck it is anywhere in the world. I'm gonna bet it's gonna be google 5 compatible
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:52.180]   I think you're actually the world is on your side on this one jeff because of
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:56.580]   5g I think that most devices
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:03.460]   Including laptops will be wireless enabled if you're stupid watch as lte
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:08.660]   Why doesn't your device where you're watching things and doing things all yeah? No, I think you'll see lte everywhere soon
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:14.580]   Question is one of the one of the plans gonna be but that's where google can make a difference with fi right
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:18.580]   I mean, I hope it doesn't charge some ridiculous monthly fee for having it
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:23.060]   But it just puts you into your data feed whatever it is and then that's easy then I just have multiple devices
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:25.620]   I will be taking t mobile
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:30.900]   And google fi and remember I learned that google fight is not work in monoco so
[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:34.100]   Oh, I will walk a couple of blocks to france
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:40.500]   And I will happens for me, you know, does it happen for you with fi yeah
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:47.540]   I like I hit point as odd as and it took like four hours for to know recognize no no no it goes right away
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:53.380]   Because I like to check in uh to to four square the minute I land wheels down
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:45:00.260]   Can I do I can I keep my four square no like it only keeps social media. No one uses. That's my rule now
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:02.900]   So
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:04.900]   I'm like
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.900]   my space
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:15.380]   I will be I will be tuning I guess what about snapchat? Where does that? No, it's right out
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:23.140]   Too popular maybe if it goes downhill a little more it has a show okay. I was like it's it's not it's on its way out as soon as no one uses it
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:25.140]   I'll be there
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:28.500]   Excellent. Actually, I think that's a pretty good rule of thumb for social media
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:30.500]   Only use social media. No one else is using
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:34.180]   Ah because you find no one there it's adi social media
[01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:41.060]   So I will also be carrying this to have global Wi-Fi with me. This is the sky roam
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:46.100]   I we we tried it in japan. We it worked really well. It's not cheap
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:49.940]   It's I think nine dollars a day for unlimited for five devices
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:53.140]   99 dollars for the month, but but between me and lisa
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:58.260]   99 dollars. This is much better than vera's inner team. Oh, well team mobile. You're fine though
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:00.900]   Fives 10 bucks a gigabyte. So
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:05.140]   But is fine gonna be as fast. So I won't away be testing
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:09.060]   All of these devices. I had used it in japan and really liked it
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:14.660]   Uh, it was a real because I don't have fine on every device and I have it on my lap. I guess I could do a hot smooth
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:17.540]   It again. It's called the sky room solace
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:20.340]   You can rent it or buy it
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:23.860]   Uh, it's like 150 bucks to buy it's basically a it's like a my fight
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.460]   But what I like about it's a little bit bigger
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:30.340]   Which means you can use it also to charge your phone. It's a battery pack as well and and it's global
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:32.500]   It's totally global
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:36.260]   Which is really cool. So you don't have to change sims or anything
[01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:41.300]   It just works 99 bucks and that's important because i'm gonna be in seven different countries in three weeks
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:47.300]   So does the does the do you buy time that that expires or any of that? No, it doesn't expire
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:52.020]   Uh, well, yes, you do you subscribe you either get a day pass which expires at the end of the day
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:54.900]   Uh, there's no there's no bandwidth cap
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:57.300]   They they say this is a day pass
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:59.700]   $9 a day and i'm but i'm gonna do the
[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:04.740]   $99 for the months because we're going for three weeks. So it'll be a better deal. Yeah
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:07.540]   And um
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:09.540]   It's a $99 for the puck
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:11.620]   Uh
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:16.500]   I think the puck's 150. I'm not sure 150. Yeah, okay, but you could rent it
[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:20.420]   Oh, and if you rented it for $10 a day if you know if you didn't use it all the time
[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:27.620]   That would make $10 a day is actually what Verizon charges for daily internet access on your phone. That's right. That's right. And atnt
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:33.140]   I think charges that too. So they're here. Yeah, 99 is the better deal if you're gonna be gone long enough
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:37.060]   If you only gone a week, it's not worth it. But if you're gone two weeks then it would be a better deal
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:42.820]   And there somebody told me there are a bandwidth caps. I never ran into them. So
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:47.300]   Uh, i'll give you i'll give you a report when I get back, but this is this is gonna be
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:52.660]   I think you need to use it and join us on twig actually. I don't know if it's
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:56.980]   That's a good test. All right next Wednesday when let me see where i'm gonna be
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:02.500]   I don't know where i'm gonna be but uh, if it's Wednesday, it must be Belgium
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:07.620]   Tuesday. Oh, are we switch we're no no it's gonna
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:14.580]   If it's Tuesday, no, it will be Wednesday. It'll be Wednesday. I'll be in Portugal
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:16.260]   Put them out
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:23.060]   Put the gal put the gal put the mal put the gal and the our our our our our our gavs all gavs
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:27.380]   I'll be in port and then we do this show
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:32.100]   At 2000 UTC. I might have sailed by then. I might be at sea
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:34.820]   That's the bad thing about a cruise
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:41.140]   You know, you'll leave the ship sails. So my ship will have sailed. I'm sorry. I'll be at sea. I can't could i can't talk to you
[01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:43.860]   That's a really good excuse
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:52.660]   I'll be on my way to tanger. I'll be sailing when sailing from portugal to tanger. I'll leo leo are you wait a second
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:49:02.100]   You are gonna take it aren't you? Oh, I should wear a fez in fez
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:06.820]   Well, hell. Yeah. Well, huh. Yes. Do you have like a costume drawer or something?
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:10.020]   Right there
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:12.020]   It's right there
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:18.100]   Yeah, actually, you know, I had to do some calculations because apples event is gonna be on september 12th and midnight
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:21.460]   pacific time on friday the 14th. I we think
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:25.380]   and that turns out perfectly to be 9 a.m
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:29.060]   as we sail into a maufi italy, so I will be
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:31.860]   busy ordering an iPhone
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:34.180]   Not looking at the scenery
[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:37.140]   Going refreshing the apps apple store like crazy
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:41.220]   I'm worried because I think that google's gonna put out like three or four things
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:43.940]   I can't afford the wall. Oh
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:46.820]   If I knew I knew I think my priority is a new pixel
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:52.420]   The consensus seems to be that the event we didn't mention this will be october 9th
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:57.300]   Yes, google has not said but it is consensus. I don't know why in new york
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:01.860]   Certainly the pixel three we've seen that in many of you craning off video
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:07.060]   But uh, you think they're gonna do a new chrome book a pixel book a new pixel book and a watch
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:11.380]   Say somewhere. I we're pretty sure they're gonna watch if I we didn't mention the new android where
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:13.780]   I should have put that in the
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:20.100]   Chain. Oh, I I tried to I tried to make us talk about that the coach or the new where just there's a there's some updates to where o s
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:22.740]   Yeah, um
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:25.220]   And coach has one
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:27.220]   No, no, I'm saying and
