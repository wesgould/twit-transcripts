[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.000]   Twig. This week in Google, the show we cover the latest news from the Google verse from Facebook,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.680]   from Twitter to Jeff Jarvis is here, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.160]   He's also the author of many books including what would Google do? Private parts is one of
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.240]   no public parts is one of our latest and then of course, ski-experient gifts is his latest.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.720]   They're all on the usual suspects, Amazon, etc. And he blogs at Buzzmachine.com. Hello, Jeffrey.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.920]   Hello. Good to see you. Nice to see you. Also joining us, we're thrilled to have him.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.040]   Aaron Nukem. Always. Always. Hello, Aaron. Aaron is a maker. You see him pretty regularly on Floss
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.880]   weekly. In fact, you were on yesterday on Floss Weekly and he also joins all about Android fairly
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.680]   frequently and you've been on all of our shows. Yeah, I think so. Except for Mac Break Weekly,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.440]   you know, I kind of avoid the whole Mac, Apple verse. For more of a Linux guy. So yeah, so I
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.200]   prefer to go on all about Android or Google. What are you running? You're running Windows, it looks
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   like. Windows, I am shocked. I am. It's this is a company laptop. So I can't I don't get a choice.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.920]   Can't put Linux bit on there. Yeah, that's what I thought. But don't tell anybody.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.720]   Aaron works at NetApp. NetApp. That's right. Yeah, which is. Storage. Okay. Yep. Good enough.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.560]   Yep. Big storage systems for data centers. Yep. Lots of storage. Yep.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:15.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, we can talk today about many things. As always.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.160]   Jeff, where do you want to start? Where do you start? Oh, God, I don't know. We talk about the
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.320]   Twitter thing that's going back and forth. I have not yet seen it. Remember, we talked last
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.240]   week, Twitter, it's actually ad nauseam, probably, that Twitter was going to put a,
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.000]   I don't know if we actually talked on Twig about this. Oh, I don't know. After Twig.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.960]   It was up to Twig else. They were going to do, as Facebook does, not a chronological feed,
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.400]   but an algorithmic feed that would surface the best tweets you might have missed and then show
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   the rest. Jack at first said, it's not exactly a former Twitter engineer said, well, it would be
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.280]   great. And then they've done something, but they're not, they haven't done that yet. They've,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.720]   it's kind of, now see, I don't, whatever it is, I don't have it yet. It's rolling out.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.600]   But the idea is that it's kind of while you're away, the while you're away stuff will surface,
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.840]   but it's algorithmically chosen the best tweets you might have missed and then you can go on and
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.400]   see whatever else is going on, kind of like, well, I like while you were away. Jeff, are you
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.160]   getting the new thing? No, I'm not. No, I don't think I am. No.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.240]   I use tweet deck. Anyways, I'll never get it there.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.600]   So here it's Jack's tweet tweets you missed from people you follow,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.360]   recap in reverse cron, refresh back to live, flip it on to try now. Interestingly,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.760]   this is a seven hour old tweet that was at top of my timeline above a one minute old tweet
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.840]   from somebody named Kim. So I guess I do have it. Yeah. Starting today, you can choose to try our
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.280]   new feature. So you'll never miss important tweets from people you follow. Well, I mean,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.240]   this is the Twitter blog. You flip on the feature in your settings. Then when you open Twitter
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.360]   after being away for a while, the tweets you're most likely to care about will appear at the top
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.280]   of your timeline still recent and in reverse chronological order. The rest of the tweets will
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.800]   be displayed right underneath also in reverse chronological order is always at any point,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   just pull to refresh to see all the new tweets at the top. Now this of course,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.920]   I didn't know this. Well, this of course requires that you use
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.080]   either the dedicated Twitter client or Twitter on the web. I'm not sure.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.600]   I don't know. Shall I look at my settings and see if I can find. Yeah, I'm looking at the
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.280]   settings right now. I don't see anything. Twitter's settings have gotten like Facebook large and
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.200]   arcane. It's just Twitter. It shouldn't be this complicated. Should it history?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.840]   Oh, that's orders. Mark media and video do not inform me. I actually do inform you before I
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.880]   should see media that would maybe sensitive. I should just turn that one on for sure.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.640]   Reenter your Twitter password to save changes to your account. Okay.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.440]   Oh, I blocked lots of people.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.840]   Woo.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.720]   Woo. That's a long list. So my question is, what happens when you have a,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.680]   let's say Leo, you tweet something, right? And then I reply right away. And then someone else
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.360]   replies, someone else replies, and there's this whole kind of conversation flowing in chronological
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.880]   order, but then it only promotes your part of the conversation. Then it would, well, that's one
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.680]   complaint people have had is that conversations will get broken up. Yeah. But that's not the blue
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.080]   line will show you on the web anyway. If it's a conversation, we'll let you see the conversation,
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.680]   right? Okay. See, I'm not a huge Twitter user. Yeah. See, that's the, that's
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.760]   yeah, I'm trying to compare this on a huge Twitter user. And I don't know how it works. So
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.040]   that's kind of the thing about Twitter is you didn't really have to know anything to use it.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.280]   Right.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.680]   I don't see a setting either, Jeff, and they weren't clear about where that setting is.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.840]   So Twitter at this moment is releasing its report, initial report. All right.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.600]   And I just saw this for Stephen to war and this is that the monthly average users for Q4 15
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.440]   were actually down on a sequential basis. That's going to kill them in the stock market.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.640]   The revenue was up 48% from the same period. But this market has never cared about that.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:17.840]   Right. The market only cares. The market only cares about growth. Growth's been slowing. So
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.560]   Twitter's stock has been diving. And now with a negative growth, I would imagine it'll dive.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.160]   Well, I want to confirm that, folks. I don't see the story. I just saw a tweet.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.920]   Matthew, I'm retweeting. That's why we like the Twitter. It's all see. Was it algorithmically
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.880]   promoted? Is that how you found that breaking business? Yes. Twitter shares plunge after fourth
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:44.800]   quarter earnings now down 12% according to market watch. But except that I'm looking,
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.280]   now it's up 4%. Nope. Now it's down 5%. It's up. It's down. It's down. It's up. You see that?
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:59.120]   Look at that plunge. And then it rebounded a little bit. But currently, the key is that market cap is
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.520]   now 9.83 billion. That's what it would cost to do a hostile takeover just to buy it by a
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.120]   buying Twitter base. What was the market cap at its highest? Everybody have any idea?
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   A lot more than that. I don't know. I could probably get a market cap graph.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:21.840]   But I don't. If I cared. Twitter reported a net loss of $90 million. That's better, though,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.120]   than in the year to year. It was $125 million this time last year. Adjusted earnings for sure,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.760]   $0.16. That's above the consensus. So usually the market likes that. That's probably why it's
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.360]   going up and then down or down and then up. Sales of $710 million. That's almost double what they
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   did a year ago. So Anthony DeRozis, if you've exclude what SMS fast followers,
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:51.840]   Twitter lost 2 million users since last quarter. However, it reported flat, 320, 320, 320 million
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.320]   monthly active users. So it rounded down. Yeah. And I rounded up. Well, it didn't do the exclusion
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.240]   that you just described. What is it? The fast SMS users? Why would you exclude those? I don't even know.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:10.880]   And then Bill Lee says, if you take out 2 billion, 4.2 billion current assets, less 2 billion
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.400]   in liabilities. Twitter is effectively as valued at only 8 billion. 8 billion.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   Again, getting more and more affordable. We learned that last week, Mark Andreessen had,
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.560]   along with Silver Lake, considered a buying Twitter outright. That would be an interesting play.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.680]   One of the things, Jason Kellogg and S on Twitter a week and a half ago. And he
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.320]   I asked him, well, who would buy Twitter? And he said, well, there's two categories. There's
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.720]   one companies like, say, Google or Apple that would integrate it into their existing business
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.960]   Twitter be of value to integrate it into your existing business. The other would be investment
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:51.760]   companies intending either to spin off or turn around Twitter. Right. I'm Mark Andreessen is probably
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.320]   one of the few people in the world who thinks he could turn around Twitter.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.400]   Yeah, we'll get to a story later. Today, he probably doesn't feel too good about being on Twitter.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.520]   He stepped in it. We'll get to that later. Yeah. It's tough. I mean, it's like Marissa Mayer
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:12.480]   trying to turn around Yahoo. Right. So I got it. So Verizon will just buy both Yahoo and Twitter
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.200]   and AOL. And we'll sit there and we'll never see them again.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.000]   That was the rumor. It wasn't that Verizon was looking at Yahoo's properties. That would make sense.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.840]   Verizon bought AOL and
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:38.320]   yeah, you have to feel like if Verizon buys you. Well, it used to be if AOL or Yahoo bought you,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.680]   you disappear into the basement. Yeah. Yeah. You died. Yeah.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:53.040]   It's a conundrum. I mean, Yahoo's got all of these great assets. And yet, they're not,
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.280]   at least from my perspective, people will disagree with me, but they're not compelling
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.840]   anymore. Right. And so what do you do? You're just sitting on these, you know,
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.680]   Flickr and some a couple other things and
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   but it's not really compelling. So it's the same thing with Twitter. For me, anyway,
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.880]   it doesn't seem to be as compelling. Really, I feel like Twitter has the real conundrum on Twitter
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:25.920]   is that it is kind of inherently valuable as what was it the guy in the new Republic said
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.560]   as kind of the news feed of the world. If you want to know what's happening right now,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:38.560]   you go to Twitter, right? Yep. And there's a real value there. Now, with only what is it?
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.440]   320 million active monthly active users. It's a I mean, that's a lot of people.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:50.080]   But it's not I guess is I guess part of the problem is the scale is now dwarfed because
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.640]   of Facebook's 1.6 billion people. Yeah, it makes three Twitter look low.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.600]   You know, Twitter could say this is antithetical to ways to look in Valley
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.960]   operates, but say we don't want the whole world. We want the elite people who are actually going
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.200]   to share stuff worth sharing who care about sharing. And that's where the news is. You know,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   it's a bit of a spin, but maybe there's a way to do that. I don't think Twitter is just used
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.880]   by elites. It's just used by pockets by so different social groups. Yeah, but there are those who
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:23.760]   argue actually that the that it is an elite within Twitter is the action is tech showbiz,
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.800]   celebrity. There's a pretty thin layer of Twitter that is most of Twitter.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:38.400]   Anything else for the results? No, I'm just kind of scanning them to see if,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:45.520]   you know, Henry Blodget tweets, now that Twitter's valuation is attractive by which
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.560]   it means they're attractive for take right for take over. I think we will get some news in the
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:57.200]   next few weeks about a takeover. Good article by Matthew speaking to Matthew Ingram. I love
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.360]   Matthew Ingram. Good article, I think, and I'd love to get your opinion about the author's guild
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.360]   and the Google book scanning. This is, you know, Google started scanning kind of unilaterally ages
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:17.760]   ago. The author's guild said, you're stealing our stuff. They lost many times in court because,
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.880]   you know, here's here's here's here's the opinion piece and the Wall Street Journal on Monday.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:31.600]   How Google stole the works of millions of authors, authors, guild president Roxanna Robinson writes,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.960]   in 2004, Google sent its moving vans to the libraries and carted off some 20 million books.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:46.480]   What a sinister copy them all, including books in copyright and books not covered by copyright.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.000]   And asked no authors or publishers for permission and it offered no compensation for their use.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.400]   So they sued and lost and sued again. They started in 2005 as they started this process
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:09.360]   and sued again. And the thing is in in in court, in 2013, the judge Jenny Chen ruled the Google's
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:15.360]   book scanning project met quote, all the legal requirements for fair use. Not only did the scanning
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.520]   and indexing of books provide what the judge called significant public benefits, both to authors and
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:29.040]   book lovers, but Chen said all society benefits. He said it is a transformational use. Reminder
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.520]   here, Google never makes the full contents of the book available for reading its snippets.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.160]   Yep. And they do Google is doing what a library patron does. Google borrows the book.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.280]   He can do whatever it wants with that book and it gives the book back. Well,
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.320]   okay. So it records the book. It copies the book. Right. That's the issue. We went through that
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:53.200]   exact same argument when it came to VCRs, right, that the act that is somehow copying
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.440]   for an internal use was a copyright violation copyright law. I'm committing to see more and
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.800]   more and more. You know, Larry Lessick was right is is an uploaded concept. Yeah. Well,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.840]   so in fact, the author's guild is now appealed to the Supreme Court and is hoping the Supreme Court
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:17.520]   will hear it. But the author's guild is somewhat according to Matthew Ingram changed its argument,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.920]   saying lower courts have in fact distorted copyright law beyond its original meaning
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:30.640]   by overemphasizing this transformative use. Transformative use is one of four measures for
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:38.240]   fair use. If it's a transformative use of the original, it's considered a fair use. The court
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.120]   has to consider the purpose of the infringing use, the nature of the original work, the amount of
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.800]   the original work used and the impact the infringement might have in the market for the original.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:54.960]   So in the new argument, the new brief before the Supreme Court hoping they'll take the case,
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.080]   they haven't yet. The author's guild says the second circuits refusal give real weight to any
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.920]   factor other than the perceived transformative purpose also contracts the approach mandated
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:11.520]   in other circuits more fundamentally. It threatens to undermine protection of copyrighted works in
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.040]   a digital age to an extraordinary extent. Such a radical rewrite of copyright law
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.200]   should not be allowed to stand without this court's consideration. Matthew point says this is,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:27.840]   this is in a sense, the lawyers for the author's guild dangling a carrot in front of the justices
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.320]   saying, now you really want to take this case because we're talking about, you know, a massive,
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.600]   right, subtle transformation of the copyright law raises the stakes with them. It's not just about us.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:44.240]   I, you know, on the one hand, if the Supreme Court took this case,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.400]   they could settle it once and for all. And it would help a little bit in an
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.720]   understanding of what copyright means in the digital or you can argue that it's already been
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.360]   settled once and for all. Yes. Yeah, by certain reason. Yeah, two separate court opinions.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:05.920]   Why is he, Jeff, you're an author. What's why does Margaret atwood hate Google so much?
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:13.520]   Yeah, I know it's, it's, you know, it's this notion of content. I was talking with somebody,
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:20.320]   a very smart guy last week who was looking into government data and he was trying to look for the
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.800]   economic benefit of government data being being opened. And I said, you know, to me,
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.480]   the way to attack this question is that in the case of government data, and I know this is going
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:36.000]   to sound like it's irrelevant, but I'll get there in a second. There should never ever be a question
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.120]   of copyright. Number one, because information cannot be owned. And in the case of data, it's a
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:46.080]   clear case of that only the treatment of information can be owned. That's copyright. So there should
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.400]   never be a question the government has copyright on data, especially our data second issue, of course,
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.040]   is that it's already paid for in its hours. There's economic benefit to it. And government
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.480]   should never own copyright in my view. Now you transfer that to this, to what Google has done.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.880]   It's not just about, you know, Google didn't in a sense, I would argue, copy the pros to have the
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.800]   pros Google copied the data to have the data. You know, what does mankind say in all of its books?
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.600]   Humankind, pardon me, say in all of its books. That's information, that's data, that's knowledge,
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.120]   that's, that's worth having there is a societal benefit, as the judge said.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.720]   They didn't copy it to go read the books for free or to sell the books to others.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.760]   Would say it is, in fact, indeed, a different transformative use that I think does fit fair use.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.880]   But authors just can't get their heads around that because they and just like newspapers,
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.520]   just like magazines, just like TV stations, we sell content. And as long as you stand the
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:48.000]   business of selling content, you're going to be commodified. And I think that's an
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.440]   outmoded business model. Oh, and also, oh, good. I was just saying to kill books,
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.720]   I'm not saying to kill a copyright, but is that the basis of business models
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.480]   moving forward? I don't think so. Sorry, you have to be that kind of transformative about
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:09.200]   the whole thing. This is a very straightforward, in my opinion, use is what Google was created
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.920]   to index all information, make it available to your fingertips. It are not selling the book.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.560]   They're not right. They're not giving you the full text of the book. They're letting you search
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.720]   what would otherwise be a dark area, which is your book. So you can discover it, find it,
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.560]   and even in some cases by it. That's exactly my point. And that's what I was going to
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.240]   bring up is that if you're an author, don't you want your work to be discovered? I mean,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.360]   you want to be regulated to doing book signings at bookstores, not the bookstores are bad,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.640]   love bookstores, but you're missing out on a whole broader universe of exposure to your work.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:48.640]   And I know that I don't know about you guys, but I have found books on Google books through
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.080]   Google searches that I do, where I was looking for something very specific. And oh, by the way,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:58.000]   there's a book. And I can tell by scanning how they let you look at a snippet of the book,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.880]   I looked at that. I'm like, oh, yeah, this is exactly what I'm looking for. I'm going to go buy
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.160]   this right now. I would never find that in a bookstore. Exactly. And then clear lesson that
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.960]   I've learned in the business, whether this is news stories or books or music or whatever it is,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:17.920]   your content is your best ad. The content itself is what draws people. In a real Murdoch arguing that
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:23.200]   three lines snippet is theft. Of course, we know is patently absurd that that three lines snippet
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:30.000]   actually might be too short to effectively send audience to what you've made. So yeah, I don't
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.360]   think there's that much new in this case. I hope this report doesn't take it because I think it's
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:44.720]   settled law now. If they do, I shudder to think what they might do. But there's Lawrence Lessing
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.440]   tried to take the extensions of copyright to the Supreme Court and he failed there.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.280]   Supreme Court in the past has not been terribly interested in, I think, revisiting copyright. So
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:03.760]   we'll see. The Engram Viewer is a really good example. Somebody says in the chatroom of how this
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:13.360]   is transform transformative. Let's do a search. You can search across books from 1800 to the year
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:23.440]   2000. You can use multiple search. So you can see how let's say the tragedy of the commons
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:32.080]   and jid-d. I don't know why I'm searching for that of the commons. Let's see how that
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:40.480]   search term being much more mentioned ever since 1964. I mean, that's a silly. What would be a
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:48.720]   good example? I don't want to tell it television. Oh, yeah. I got radio, newspaper, television,
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:22:01.920]   and see how these trends have changed. Radio peaked in 1945 when it would have got more than twice the
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.520]   number of mentions of newspapers. TV started going up, then radio went down, but TV crossed
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:13.280]   radio. The television didn't peak the way radio did. Yeah. Well, not yet. It was kind of a, well,
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:20.400]   no, it's not yet. In 1978, it crossed radio and of course, it continues to be number one now.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:28.160]   Newspapers though, their peak was also in kind of in the 30s, but it's held fairly steady ever since.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.120]   Which would argue the radio was more, was a more transformative
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.960]   societal. You see, that's how an academic uses this kind of stuff. Yeah. It's really,
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.960]   diagrams are really great. Okay, how about video games? Here's a good one.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:48.480]   Video, games, television, radio.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:57.760]   No, video, but remember, it stops at 2000s. And besides, that's probably not, you know,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.600]   best term to use. Anyway, you get the idea. Run your own experiment. Rod data is also available
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:11.520]   for download, which is kind of cool. All right, I'm still, I still don't see the,
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.840]   but apparently today we will see the new algorithmic feed on Twitter. I'm still
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.720]   waiting for that to kick in. But maybe because I live on Twitter, I always have it open.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:26.240]   I'm not seeing what I have to take a day off. Yeah, that's what I'll do. I won't use Twitter now
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:34.240]   for a while. Well, party's over for Twitter VIPs, ads back in our feed.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:43.440]   I have not seen ads on Twitter in some time. I don't even see promoted trends right now on my
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:50.640]   Twitter feed. But apparently that's going to be over. Mark and Driesen started seeing promoter
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:24:03.040]   tweets just a couple of just yesterday. Enough Twitter knows enough enough Google books news.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.520]   Let's see. How about Bandido? Let's take a break and we'll talk about Bandido.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.840]   Okay. Because I'm curious if I can read that for Andy.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.000]   Oh, I want to think about it.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   So what I had read yet, so I got to read that. Yeah, Super Bowl also breaks the record
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:28.160]   for streaming video. 3.96 million unique viewers. Can we do that on our feeds? Can we get to
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.640]   four million simultaneous viewers? Let's try that.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.120]   I don't know what that would happen. You broke the internet. You broke the internet.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:44.160]   Harry's let's talk shaven. I'm here with two bearded men. But you know, even when you have a
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.680]   beard, you still shave. I shave with Harry's this morning. Yeah. Otherwise, I'm head to
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.840]   hair. Yeah, I did not. And you can tell your suit. You look a little drizzle up. You can see
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:59.280]   you going for the prospector look. Yeah, that's a good one. We badges. We don't need no badges.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:08.160]   Show me the gold. It's gold. Harry's Harry's dot com slash twig. If you want to check it out is
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.920]   a better way to get a better razor. An amazing shaven and affordable price because they deliver
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.240]   it right to your door. And how do they do that? Well, you're buying it direct from the factory
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:24.160]   in effect. Harry's bought the famous razor factory in Germany that's been there almost a century.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.800]   And they've designed these razors for performance for
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:37.760]   price. They deliver them to you. And it starts it all starts with your great Harry's kit.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.760]   I got a I got a Winston kit, which I love. In fact, I got the winner Winston. I'm glad I got
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.640]   that the copper Winston. But there's a variety of kits for a variety of prices. You can start as
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:56.080]   little as the $15 Truman kit. A lot of people like that Truman kit. And once you get the kit,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.480]   then you can order the blades on a regular basis. And I'm not talking $32 for an eight pack. It's
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.840]   about half that they offer customized shaving plans that make it easy to get shave supplies
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:11.520]   delivered to you on your terms, including the incredible Harry's foaming shaving gel and the
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.640]   Harry's cream. I am a cream guy, but many people like the foaming shaving gel. They both smell
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.480]   fabulous. And Harry's is so confident that you will love your shave. For a limited time,

[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.400]   shower, I can shave without anything. Wow. It doesn't sell you any of the other things Harry
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.880]   sells. But that's not a good pitch. But the razor works very well. Better, better than the ones I
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:49.200]   used to buy in the drugstore. Yep. Harry's Harry's calm slash twig for your free shave.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.720]   Actually, you're going to get at least a free week's worth of shaves. Maybe more. We used we
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.120]   used Harry's to shave me for on. We did. I remember that years. You've shown everybody said,
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:05.520]   you're shaving him against the grain. Don't do it, Leo. Are you okay? No, he'll effects the
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.960]   beard group. Look, look, look, it's beautiful. Actually, your beard looks good. Yeah, it does.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:15.040]   Kind of was at least said, let me grow a beard. Oh, she won't. No. It's not the beard she
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:20.640]   minds. It's the in between time. Little then you see what that you know, the this is not Harry's,
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.320]   but I do use Harry's for the neck. Yeah, well, but then I use the Neralco. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.240]   Well, of course I would use that. I mean, it's just she doesn't like me to be scratchy.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.200]   She also says, Leo, you're on TV. You cannot have a beard. You have to have your face has to be
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.080]   open to the world. Same reason I wear contact lenses. I don't want anything hiding this
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.000]   punum from your view. This beautiful punum.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:55.200]   Oh, well, how long has it been since you've since I shaped my head?
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.120]   I had a beard. No, I had a beard in high school, I think college, maybe.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:05.280]   I find some old I went off to college. I stopped shaving. And the first time I shaved since then
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:12.000]   was was at the Twit Studio. I know. Wow. Yeah. Why do you why do you shave with why you shave
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.840]   with the grain? I've always shaved up and down. And every so everybody tells me no,
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:21.440]   you're supposed to do that. Otherwise I can't get it off. Yeah. The first time down just gets
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.160]   kind of the top layer, but you got to go my Harry's. I use Harry's for probably too long. But I know
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.840]   that moment when it doesn't just come right off against the grain. Yeah. I'm just changing the
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.160]   change of life. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:43.920]   The 3.96 million viewers of Super Bowl 50 on CBS and none of them saw those commercials.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.880]   Well, I watched all commercials beforehand. Anyway, right. That's true. If you're an internet
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.160]   viewer, you saw the commercials on YouTube. So what do you need to? Which weren't very
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.400]   impressive this year. No, the game wasn't great either. But the game often is not great because
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:04.800]   it's such a letdown after all the hype for two weeks. They average viewers per minute was 800,000.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:12.640]   And the total number of minutes, 213 million, which is interesting that a lot of people watched
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:18.480]   for more on average for a long time, 101 minutes, which is an awful lot. Yeah, it is.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:31.360]   The prior record was 1.1 million viewers, Super Bowl 2014.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:38.880]   And then, yeah, I think that was the prior record. I don't know what happened the year after that.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:46.320]   We're getting closer to a world where we don't have to have a cable to watch the stuff we want to watch.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:53.280]   I don't know. I've heard some country opinions. Really? Yeah. Just yesterday, I think on NPR or
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.720]   a day before, I guess they were talking about this. I'm trying to look it up to see
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:03.280]   see who it was. But yeah, basically the guy that they had on said, you know what, there's no way
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.440]   for live sports, there's no way you're ever going to be able to in the foreseeable future,
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.120]   replace television for live viewers of a live event. Well, that's true with four millions, nothing,
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.920]   compared to the exactly what is it, 200 million that watched. And at first, I was like, no, no,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.840]   the internet's great. What are you talking about? And then I was like, oh, yeah, that is a lot of
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:28.960]   that's a lot of simultaneous. 110 TV viewers, 110 million TV viewers. So the need is some sort
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.760]   of em bone solution. It's funny because we had this solution in the early days of the internet.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:43.360]   The em bone was created by university walks to do better streaming and worked quite well,
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.360]   but has since been decommissioned. Do you remember the em bone? Is that ring a bell?
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:55.040]   I remember the, the, the true multi cast backbone. The idea was one server can't serve 100 million
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:03.680]   people. But what you do is one server serves 10 servers, serves 1000 servers. And by multi casting,
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.440]   you're able to serve everybody who needs to be served. It's, I guess it's essentially kind of a mesh
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:13.120]   topology. Yeah, this was Dan Rayburn, by the way, in case people are interested on
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:18.400]   and oh, yeah, Dan is a vice president at streaming. Yeah, and he does a steam streaming blog and he
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:25.040]   makes he raises a good point. But Dan is also a little bit of a he's a more conservative in general
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:30.640]   about this stuff. I think did any of you you I didn't try to use it, but the but it's not live,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:36.800]   but the a bit torrent streaming client. Yep. How do it work?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:43.760]   Are you used it or do you not want to admit to it? No, I was saying yes, I know what that is.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.920]   Yeah, yeah. No, they started being streaming using which would I guess kind of be like a
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:54.880]   em bone idea because it's a period of period. Yeah. Yeah. Even alive. But that might work actually.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:00.320]   Distributed distribution. That's how Skype worked. That's how Kazah worked before Skype.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.720]   That's how Google's going to work pretty soon, apparently with hangouts. Hangouts. That's right.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.800]   They're going to start using a peer to peer to peer. I wonder whether it'll be good enough for us then.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:17.040]   You know, we for all the years, we use Skype when they weren't owned by Microsoft. Microsoft
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:23.280]   killed Skype's super node feature. But in the years before they were acquired, they had something
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:29.120]   called a super node. But it would only work if you were not behind a router, then you could be part
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.200]   of a peer to peer network because the craze of Skype were the craze of Kazah before that.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.800]   And so Skype was initially conceived of as a peer to peer network because that seemed to work
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.080]   better. But I would imagine that increases latency. We always used a dedicated port. That was one
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.960]   of the secret things, not secret, but one of the special things that we would do to improve our
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.240]   Skype is to make sure that nobody was getting super noted. That was close to a direct point-to-point
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:00.880]   connection. So super noting relieves the network maybe, but it doesn't help. I think it doesn't help
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:11.040]   improve latency. The 1994 Rolling Stones concert from Dallas was the first major cyberspace
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.960]   multicast concert. Mick Jagger opened the concert by saying, "I want to say a special welcome to
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:24.240]   everyone that's climbed into the internet tonight and has got into the M-Bone. And I hope it doesn't
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:31.600]   all collapse." Mick Jagger is not the person I want to hear saying that. Climb into the internet.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:40.080]   And get on my M-Bone. I don't know what the total number it says. 50,000 fans were able to watch
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:46.800]   over the M-Bone. That's pretty good for '94. If you think back to '94, I mean, that's pretty darn good.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:55.360]   It did require some specialized hardware to do. So you told me, speaking of K-Chord cutting,
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:04.640]   and I think Dan's right, that live events will be tough. But a lot of what we consume is not in real
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:09.360]   time. And it was last week, Jeff, that you told me to download Horace and Pete.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:19.600]   Yeah, I did. Louis CK's $5 in episode strange. It was more like theater than a television.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:26.640]   Yeah, it was theater. But the cast was what blew me away, including not only Louis CK, but Alan Alda.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.200]   Shep Shami. Shep Shami. Shep Shami. Jessica Lang sitting at the bar,
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.560]   Steven right at the end of the bar. He fell, I'll be honest, I didn't get far enough into CED.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:43.360]   You didn't? I tried. Oh, I think it's brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. I missed the laugh track.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:48.560]   Episode two. It's very dry. It sounds very dry. There's a lot of...
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:54.480]   It's Louis CK with his... But it's like a theater with no audience. It's just very...
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.800]   It is, but it really gets amazing. And the second episode, though it's not a comedy,
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:05.200]   I had four belly laughs. So there's another episode? Oh, yeah, no, this is an ongoing series
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:11.920]   every week. So the first episode was $5. And then he sent out a funny email. I quoted it in that
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:18.640]   link there. So why did the dirty F balls? Why the dirty F balls that I charge you $5 for Harris and
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:24.960]   Pete? Well, the dirty and mobile fact is this show is effing expensive. Louis CK never known for
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:30.160]   his cleanliness of speech. He has two sets, four cameras, of course, a great cast, an original
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:39.120]   theme song by Paul Simon. He says, "Every second the cameras are rolling money is shooting out of
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:45.920]   my butt like your mother's worst diarrhea." Basically, this is a handmade one guy paid for a version of
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.240]   a thing that's usually made by a giant corporation. It's very much like a play. I mean, it's written
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:56.160]   like a play. It's a little mammoth-like maybe. What was the other great line from... I think it
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.520]   was Variety or Daily Hollywood. The Hollywood Reporter said, and I'll read this, it starts as a
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.160]   Eugene O'Neill play about two brothers bringing a struggling joint transition to a David Mamet drama
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.000]   about political correctness and generational definitions of masculinity becomes a Norman
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.600]   Lear sitcom about contemporary political attitudes pivots into a check-off saga about an underestimated
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.880]   woman reclaiming the birth rate and settles into a Mike Lee kitchen sink dramedy about painful blue
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.160]   collar family revelations. I think it's all of that at once, and that's where I was a little
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.440]   unsettled by it. It's amazing. It felt like it couldn't figure out what it wanted to be.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:38.400]   No, it's all those things. The second episode is just beautiful scurrying of irony and hipsters.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:46.080]   It's a dive bar in Brooklyn, a fight over closing it. Alan Alda is the grumpiest bartender ever on
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:51.040]   Earth. Alan Alda is wonderful. He has eaten the scenery, man. He is having a ball. He is wonderful.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:38:00.320]   He loves the opportunity to say very nasty words. Yes. In long strings, chains of very nasty words.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:05.040]   It's Alan Alda as you've never seen him before. So I'll ruin one thing. So, a hipster comes in,
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.280]   the hipster comes in and says, "Whoa, wow, how cool is it being old?" And so one of them goes up to
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   buy Budweiser. No mixed drinks. He doesn't buy a Budweiser. He wants like a margarita or something.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.800]   A gin and tonic. Well, no, no, the second episode. So he buys a beer. Oh, okay. And he's charged 450.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.840]   Yeah. And he says, "Stalin Alda, you charged the guy over there $3. And Alan Alda says,
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.000]   you know, pour a beer out of your head. I don't care. It's 450. And the back and forth, back and forth.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.280]   So Louie comes along and says, "I'll take care of this. I'll take care of this." And Louie doesn't
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.600]   back down and charge. He says 450 for you. And he's the other guy $3. Yeah, he's been here a long time.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:43.360]   And he says, "But why is it 450 for me?" He said, "Listen, you got to come in here and you got beer
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:50.320]   and irony. That dies to the ear of the ears. All he does is get the sis." So the patron says,
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.120]   "So you're saying this is a douche tax?" Louie says, "Yeah, exactly." He pays the 450.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.560]   Yeah, but he did get the irony for free. Yeah. Oh my God, that's hysterical. It's wonderful.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:06.320]   There's great moments like that. It's not for everyone. I'll be honest,
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.640]   not even for Louie C, necessarily for Louie C. Keith, Suki K fans, because it's not like the
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.360]   show Louie, for instance. No, it's not. But the observational rye, oh my God,
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:21.280]   this world makes no sense to me. World view, built on chowong, is in there.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.680]   Yeah, I like it. It's written, directed, produced by him.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:34.560]   There's some, for one thing, Louie always feels like he forgot his line and he's looking for it
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:43.760]   and then says it. He's, I can't quite figure out what it is about his demeanor. He's not a natural
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:50.240]   actor. A chatroom, do you watch it? Yeah, some did. Guy Smiley says it has very strong language.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.280]   Just nice, Louie. By the way, had it been a comedy,
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.240]   PS Chop says he should have said, "Well, in that case, I'll take a beer, hold the irony."
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.680]   Do we know how many of these? I'm just looking at the prices. It's $5 for the first one and $2
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.640]   for the second one. And then he's got it with three dollars from then on.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:16.240]   The people have a kind of like the beer thing. He's just charging whatever the hell he feels like it.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:22.160]   That's tough for me to swallow. Not that that's an incredible amount of money and I guess if the
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.520]   show was a fair amount of money. In fact, I was thinking if I were going to the movies,
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.160]   I'd paid three times. Yeah. If you were buying a play, the first episode is 107 minutes.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.520]   Yeah, it's long. And it is a play. It could be shorter, actually. Well, that's a good question.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:42.000]   I don't know. I'm disappointed you didn't like it. I'm sorry. I didn't hate it. I didn't finish it.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.320]   At least I'll watch it. No, it's definitely not her cup of tea. No, really?
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:55.200]   She's not a big fan of irony. Yeah, salespeople, but money people generally aren't. Yes.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:03.680]   I think there's a certain personality that enjoys this kind of stuff.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:12.320]   And it is very much like a play. I mean, if you think of it as not a TV show,
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.880]   and at first you look at it and say, "Oh, there's going to be cheers." It's not cheers.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:28.480]   It's a play. But what I do like and I really enjoyed was that you feel like you're looking
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:35.520]   in a creative process, that you have these very talented actors and Louis just said,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.840]   "Hey, let's get together and do something." And you feel like you're kind of in on something
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.760]   that they're creating on the spot, which is nice. And the key here is, and this is the reason I
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:49.360]   want to call about it, the key here is that kind of Mickey and Judy, "Oh, hey, kids, let's put on a
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:55.280]   show in the barn." He could do it on his own. Right? Now, he could only do that because he has the
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.680]   fame that Big Old Media brought him by being a star. That's true. That's the Howard Stern's
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.520]   argument about against podcasts is that you can't be big unless you were already big.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:09.520]   Yeah, I don't understand. Nonetheless, as he says, this wasn't made by Big Corporation.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.880]   Right. Didn't need to be. He could make whatever that F he wants and he can charge you for it,
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.240]   and you can curse Adam or not. He doesn't care. There it is.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:23.440]   Right. Well, I hope he does well. We could have probably saved him some money if he wanted to
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:28.000]   shoot it here. I think that he's probably paying Hollywood prices. Right. It's not that expensive to
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.320]   have a four-camera shoot. And our lighting would have been better, frankly, his lighting was not
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.520]   very good. But I didn't think that. The set wasn't expensive. No, it's a cheap set. It was the point.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.400]   Yeah. Yeah. But it doesn't look like a cheap set, but it looks like a set. It looks like a play.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.480]   It really looked like a play. Oh, it is. It is. And as I said it last week, there are very current
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.200]   two-day-old references in it. He shot it right now. I know that was kind of wild. He's talking about
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:43:00.560]   the... They say, "Yeah, the hour caucuses are tomorrow." I mean, it was very, you know, like,
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.640]   "Oh, this was just... They just must have done this yesterday." Yeah. I think they did that. They
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.680]   must have done that in advance. No, no, no, because he mentioned stuff that happened.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:13.600]   Yeah. Did you see the debates? Oh, really? Yeah. Which is really interesting. That's pretty...
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.440]   Yeah. So he's doing it with a guy. I think he's doing basically live-tate. Yeah. It looks like
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.640]   it's done live-tate. Although, they're obviously some rehearsal involved and stuff. And I'm sure
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.640]   those actors aren't cheap. Although, I would expect he could go to them and say, "Well, I want to do
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.920]   something interesting, you want to do it for scale?" Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'd adore that. Yeah.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:37.040]   So Bandito is an interesting idea. It's basically with the Washington Post. Remember,
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.800]   the Washington Post was purchased by Jeff Bezos. And as you would expect,
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.760]   Bezos is bringing in some digital content stuff. This is very much like the A/B testing that
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:54.560]   websites do. Exactly. Bandito promotes the story, the version of the story, with the most popular
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:01.360]   headline and images. So when editors enter in an article into the digital part, obviously,
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.800]   the newspaper doesn't do this, but then digital part of their website, the editor
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.200]   can use different versions of the articles, different headlines, different images, different teaser
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:17.440]   text. The technology offers it up in a variety of ways to viewers and then decides which one is
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.880]   the most successful and optimizes, starts serving that version more frequently on the home page.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.640]   Isn't that interesting? Yeah.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:32.560]   So what's new here is the fact that they're doing this automatically without-
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:38.800]   They have a tool without intervention. Right. Yeah. And it's also, I think, I mean, people do A/B
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:46.160]   testing, but you don't do it all the time. But this is institutionalized it into their workflow,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.640]   so they just do it all the time. I wonder if Buzzfeed or Vystooth has something like that.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.400]   Oh, I'm sure. Yes, absolutely. And the difference here that says in the story is that it kind of
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:59.760]   does it automatically. Right. Right. The first iteration of the tool optimizes content based purely
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.400]   on the number of clicks, but the company hopes soon to factor in other metrics, including
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:10.640]   how much time readers spend after they click reading. This isn't just about clicks, says Sam
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.800]   Han, Engineering Director of Data Science. How many newspapers have an engineering director of
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.840]   data science? I know. I know. Clickbait works for a while, but not long term. I like hearing that
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.520]   engagement is a better metric to focus on, but we're not going to optimize just to that. We'll
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:29.120]   find a good balance. Wow. You got to figure- You should be- Go ahead. You got to figure that Jeff
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:34.160]   put him on a plane and flip him over to the post and say, "Hey, help these guys."
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:41.840]   I mean, I'm delighted that Bezos is investing in the post. I wish they were more public and more
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.120]   generous in sharing what they're learning with other newspapers. I understand kind of why they're
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:50.880]   not, but the only real competition they have is the New York Times. Everybody else is in the
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.320]   other world. And it's really neat that they are competing heavily with the New York Times. They
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.960]   a couple months ago, we can't have more, gain more US audience than the Times.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.760]   As the Times goes more international, and look at the time, what happened at the Times. The Times was
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.680]   a huge paper in New York. It's not that big a paper in New York now. It's a national paper.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.560]   As the Times becomes international, the post becomes the national paper. That's very, very
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.360]   interesting. The probably problem I have here is there's still, this is true of every damn media
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.680]   company out there. They're still shooting for page views and page views inevitably leads you
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.240]   down the road to cats and Kardashians. And we've got to move up to higher level
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:34.720]   relationships. Well, this is to me, this is a little bit of a red light here, this quote.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.960]   Yes. We have to be more careful in that area because they're talking about measuring.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:44.560]   Bandito may even begin to factor in other more detailed information about post readers into
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:49.600]   its decision making, such as whether or not a user is an existing subscriber and types of content
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:56.080]   they've engaged in within the past, kind of like the algorithmic feed they give you more of the
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:02.160]   stuff you like. We will be more careful in that area, says Han, because of privacy. And then this
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.240]   is the thing that worries me. And because we need to be sure we're providing right leaning and left
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:16.960]   leaning content equally. Well, I can argue that both ways. Because I can also say that that's
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.840]   the false balance of one column A, one from column B, Chinese menu journalism.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:27.360]   If the right has not or if the left has nothing smart to say today and nothing major to say
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.120]   today, why do you have to equal out the number of left column inches to the number right column
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.720]   inches? I understand the argument. It's a filter bubble argument that says that.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:43.040]   What if the what if the Boston Globe only showed those articles about the priest's
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.320]   molestations to non-Catholics just to avoid controversy? Well, you shouldn't do that. That
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:54.000]   would be a bad that would be wrong. Yeah, that'd be wrong. And here's the way I a smart editor,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.920]   I know, I work with a New Jersey sort of a whiteboard a couple years ago. We had this discussion and
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.840]   he said, listen, right now every we serve everybody 100% the same thing. And he said, well, if we could
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.160]   just get 20% of that that's more relevant to you. The other 80% is what editors choose still.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:14.720]   Fine. Oh, that might be all right, which is 20% or 50 50 or even in the other way, 80% relevant
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.120]   and 20% outside the filter bubble, but you're still going to have things that editors say to you,
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.720]   you you need to know this. You may not want to know about it, but you need to know,
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.400]   you may not read it, but we're going to present it to you. That's always going to be the case in
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:30.000]   these products. And I don't mean to take away that editorial prerogative, but there is tons of
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.560]   noises irrelevant to me. Number one, number two, there's also too much content. The Guardian,
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:40.720]   which I work with and full disclosure and dearly love produces four to 600 pieces of content a day.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:46.160]   No rational world. Can you imagine that a reader is going to come in and I saw it all.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:52.640]   I'm I'm I'm seated now. No, you got to do a better job of giving people greater relevance within that
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.600]   structure. Well, I mean, I think it's it's not a direct parallel here. But what you're saying,
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:03.040]   I mean, when I use Google's news app, they show you they say, are you interested in this? You know,
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.160]   we've noticed that you've been searching for this. They don't say that that something pops up that
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.840]   I was searching on, you know, over the past week a lot, something will pop up and says, are you
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.840]   interested in this? You know, and a lot of times, it's stuff from my kids that I'm not interested in,
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.480]   and then I can click yes or no. And it's not the whole that actually is about 20% of the the
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.360]   headlines feed is that that here's suggestions for you based on your interest. And the rest is,
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:28.160]   you know, world headlines, US headlines, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But I like the way they do,
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.840]   I actually like that because then I can say, yes, I'm interested in Raspberry. This is another
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:38.400]   example of there are a lot of examples in technology of things the end user loves, but may not be good
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:46.960]   for him. So the real the real issue is it is in everybody's interest, except for societies,
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.920]   that you only see stuff you agree with, you'll be happier, you'll click more, you'll buy more
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:59.520]   products, everybody'll be happier if we just eliminate all that irritation. But that's not
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.920]   what we want. You may end up ignorant. Yeah, but you will be yeah, you won't have any idea what
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.680]   the what's what's really going on, because you're only seeing stuff you agree with. Yeah.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:15.760]   I do worry a little bit about that. I'm not like you. I'm I kind of dismissed Eli Parriser's article
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:22.320]   arguments in the filter bubble, because I felt like you Jeff that the real value and promise of
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.600]   the internet is that we are exposed to far more than we ever got exposed to before. But if algorythically,
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:33.920]   you know, this is ad this is like ad tech. This is why we can't have nice things.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.280]   We haven't done it with with content. This is why we can't have nice things,
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:41.840]   because then algorithmically they figure out, oh, you know, just irritating to show these guys
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:46.400]   stuff that they don't like. Oh, I think you're being you're being typically dystopian.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:53.200]   I think that our business has done a terrible, terrible job of giving us relevance. It treats
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:57.520]   us as a mass. It gives us a one size fits all product. It has to move this way. Now, the question
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:02.800]   is what signals does it use and how does it use them? You know, I'm not a sports fan. Stop wasting
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:07.200]   your time trying to promote sports to me. I'm not going to want it. Unless I go searching for it.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.760]   I actually like media stories. I like stories about Google. How nice to me if there's a story
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:16.000]   buried in the Wall Street Journal that or New York Times about Google, I would like it to raise
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.680]   that to my attention. That's a perfectly fine thing to do. I just worry when the marketing department
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.720]   gets a seat at the editorial table. It's actually the opposite. The marketing department's been doing
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.520]   this for years. Now, finally, editorial is going to use these skills and tools for the benefit of
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:40.160]   the user. Good. From your mouth to marketing, Zir. And so what I my wish for the for the for
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:45.440]   the Washington Post and Bezos involvement has long been from the day it was announced, he was buying
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:52.400]   it. I argue that we've got to shift to a relationship based strategy in news and Bezos and relevance
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:58.800]   value and Bezos understands relevance built on relationship data better than anybody there is.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:04.960]   And so those are the skills I want to see him bring to the post. Now, you can do this badly,
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:09.280]   right? A programmatic and retargeting advertising. You look at Amazon, you look at those boots,
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.320]   those boots fall you around for six weeks after long after you bought the friggin boots.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:17.440]   That's a bad implementation of what otherwise could be a useful technology.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:22.160]   Most people most of the time when people don't like add customization is because it's done it's
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:26.960]   because the algorithm suck. If it did it well, they wouldn't even know what's happening. They
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.280]   just go kind of love it because I only see ads for stuff I'm about to buy. Yeah, but it doesn't
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:38.400]   it's computers aren't that smart yet. Yeah. All right. I agree. We're all in agreement here.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:48.720]   Sundar Pichai got a nice little bonus, the new CEO of Google. I love the article in
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:53.120]   the Verge by Michael Singleton. Sundar Pichai is having a better February than you are.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:53:02.240]   270,000 shares of restricted stock currently worth $199 million. It's the largest.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:06.800]   Wonder what the vesting period is. Yeah. It's the largest equity stake given to an executive
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.960]   officer whose grants have been publicly fired in the company's history.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:17.520]   So what you're saying is they're often with this kind of stock award.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.680]   They're often restrictions on how quickly he can capitalize on it.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:28.640]   You have more to this. You either have options or you have restricted restricted is a gift to
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.880]   him at a date in the future. Yeah, these are restricted stock that's interesting. They're not
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:38.240]   options. So options is an option to buy this at a price. Usually a strike price is lower than
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:44.320]   the current price. That's the theory anyway. But a restricted stock gift means you here have
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:50.320]   some stock and of course it'll go up and down. And typically you'd say you get 20% in the first
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:55.840]   year, another 20% every year thereafter till the fifth year when you've finally vested 100%.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.080]   Or in some cases they do it's just five years out and it's a lump sum.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.760]   You don't get any of it. You kept you here for five years. And the problem is,
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.320]   the only problem is that you were getting it from because it's not an option. You paid nothing
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.640]   for it so you have to pay taxes on the full value of what you require, which means you usually,
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.120]   that's when you see executive sell stock in their own company. It's often to pay the taxes on a
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.520]   reward like that because it's a lump sum. It's a very nice thing to get.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.320]   Yeah, you get 200 million but you got to give the government half.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:31.280]   Company also gave the CFO with poor at 38.3 million dollars in stock.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.160]   She's been a rookie. Yeah, you bet. And Diane Green, the head of the cloud business,
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:42.480]   42.8 million dollars. So they're all doing nicely. Those are based on current,
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:47.760]   Google's current price of course, Google's stock value goes up so well there. It says,
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:54.480]   "Pachai and poor at stock awards will vest in quarterly increments through 2019." So it's only
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:01.440]   three years. Wow. We're going to do it okay. So not only is Google the most valuable company,
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:08.720]   it's got the richest executives. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Arguably. Nice work if you can get it.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:15.920]   We're going to take a break, come back with more. Aaron Nukem is here from NetApp,
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:21.360]   regular on many of our shows including, he's brought a little maker thing. Yes, I always bring
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:26.640]   a project. Including Floss Weekly and the new screen savers. We'll see that as your pick of the
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:31.200]   week. That is. Okay, good. That's my project. I have a make a re-pick myself.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:37.360]   I don't. And Jeff, I'm doing number. I'm clumsy. I can't build any things.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:44.720]   Do you still have your 3D doodler pen? Yeah, somewhere. You ever use that? You ever break it out?
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:49.040]   Say, I think I'm going to bring it out as often as I use my Google Glass.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:55.520]   I shouldn't say that. It's not nice. It's a very nice device. But I, I also have a cabinet of
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:04.480]   Lost Toys. Oh, do you ever? Oh, do you ever? I thought the, remember the book light that you got
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:09.280]   in the Kickstarter and I got the cheap Chinese clone? It's pretty nice bamboo. It looks like a book.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:17.360]   In fact, Lisa was, because it, yeah, that, I love that. My has a bamboo cover. Lisa saw it on my
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.400]   bedside table and she said, what's this? She said, oh, it's his journal. Let me read it.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:26.720]   And it opened them. It was a big light. It's a big light. We're just going to turn it on.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:31.200]   Earlier, we did a triangulation with the founder of Firo, the guy who invented the Sfiro and the
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.800]   BB8 and stuff. And he gave me his business card. This is the coolest thing ever.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:43.840]   It's a circuit board, pre-punched breadboard that you could then add the components to.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:48.080]   And he showed me a picture. He made a car out of it.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:52.640]   That you turn on the light on your smartphone and it follows the light.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.000]   Nice. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know what it can do. I don't know where the specs are. But
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.680]   what a good idea for a business card. Yeah, I was going to do that. And I did the paper one.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:04.640]   Remember that? Yeah. I've still got it in there somewhere. Yeah. Paper was a lot cheaper for me.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:09.920]   I'm seeing more and more expensive. Yeah, I would imagine this is, you know, five bucks a business.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:14.880]   You don't get those in this print. Makes me jealous, though.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:20.480]   Yeah, they're cool. Yeah. Who gave us a, was it Kevin Mitnick? I think Kevin Mitnick's business
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:28.560]   card is a lock pick set. Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Yep. Yep. Legal in some states.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:32.960]   Wouldn't that be weird if your business card were illegal in the state of California?
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:37.280]   Our show today brought to you by Nature Box. Oh, is it snack time? Yay.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:41.120]   Yay.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:48.320]   Poor Jeff was ripped off. We sent him his Feds in a nature box because we had some left over.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:54.080]   And he got all excited. Don't let this happen to you, children. Make sure that when you get your

[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:34.240]   make salad dressing by blending them up. But I love to use the nature box flavored cashews. Yeah,
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.200]   because then it's a really good dress. It's like sriracha flavored.

[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:16.800]   That's just a recipe for disappointment. Get the biggest box you can. Naturebox.com/twit.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:23.920]   So I've been playing with my echo. Have you played with the echo at all for your maker stuff? Nope,
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:30.160]   not yet. And we had somebody on Sunday who works at an AWS and he said, have you written any
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:36.800]   echo commands? And I said, you can write them yourself? He said, oh, yeah, you just go on lambda,
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:43.040]   AWS lambda. And there's a whole API. You can write them in any language you want. He was using no JS.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.720]   You can use Python, Ruby, anything you want. You write them and so you can have your own private
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.680]   commands or if you know it works well, you can publish them. And obviously, Amazon's doing that
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.720]   because they're the echo commands are going crazy. They just added Domino's pizza and Ubers.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.000]   So you can say echo, get me a car. It'll use your Uber account and the car'll pull up.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.720]   Yep.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.760]   Love this. Yeah. Friend of mine does this whole shopping list that way.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.920]   Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Yep. Because we have an echo in the in the kitchen and the bedroom.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.680]   So lambda, you know about AWS lambda because I had never heard of this before.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.800]   It's kind of a neat idea. It lets you run code, but you don't have to provision a server.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.920]   So normally, like on AWS, you would spin up a Linux instance and you know, it'd be yours. But
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.640]   lambda pays all you pay only for the compute time you consume, right?
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.080]   Which is which is awesome for especially for developers. If you're starting a company,
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.560]   starting a new app, anything like that, right? You don't want to have to even bother setting up
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.960]   your own instance and have it running without using it most of the time, right? You just want
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.320]   to run your code. Have it work. I think this is great. I think it's anything
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.320]   it's great that Google is jumping on board here too.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.400]   Well, that's the story, but let me just finish this. So the reason they use that's great for the
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.640]   echo and somebody wants to just do something is it doesn't cost you anything unless there's a
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.920]   fixed cost of whatever one tenth, the one cent per command. But it's going to be minuscule.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:07.280]   It's minuscule. And you don't so you don't have to pay to spin up a server all month long to
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:12.480]   issue a few commands. So Google seeing the success of this says we're going to do our own.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:18.080]   It's called the Google cloud platform. Google, it's called a Google cloud functions.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.520]   You could set up functions that get triggered in response to certain events.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:30.960]   Much like Lambda. Now they say this is in alpha and you have to get access by filling out a form
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:36.640]   and they will grant you access. No blog post, no tweet. But thanks to VentureBeat, we know
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:42.640]   that they're doing this. This comes over. Remember we talked about a Werner Fogle's column that he
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:51.680]   wrote two months ago? Remind me. It was I'm just trying to find it. It's it's kind of how in the
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:57.520]   web separated content from presentations, this separates code from server. Yeah.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:04.880]   And it goes to kind of a radically distributed view and a content perspective.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:10.480]   You could have content that sits out there as a blob of content that that doesn't really have
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:15.680]   an address or doesn't have anything. It starts to get you to read it. Vera is a brilliant unsung
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:20.320]   guy and it gets you to rethink a lot of how this operates. We live in an amazing world. Java
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:25.440]   man in our chat room actually reminds me that the first million requests on Lambda are free.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:32.480]   So unless you write a very elaborate, you must have to write the most popular echo command ever.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.680]   Somebody's written a fart machine that different farts every time you ask. That might be that
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.720]   might be exceeding the million requests. But as there is there a directory of of oh yeah,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.120]   you can just put on your you go to your Amazon account. Well, do you have an echo? No, I don't.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.960]   Well, let me go to my Amazon account. I can show you it's it is exploding.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.680]   Partly because it's so easy and inexpensive to do this. There's no reason
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:02.400]   not to. I mean, if you have an idea. So let me look at my echo.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.760]   Or maybe I have to go to devices. I always.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:14.720]   You can go to the echo website. Oh, there's an echo not on Amazon.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.600]   No, it's got its own. It's got its own site. Yeah, it's where you can access.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.640]   Because I also use the.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:27.680]   I'm trying to find the site. I also use.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:35.440]   The app. There's an app that's the easiest way to do it. Oh, there you go. I was just going to say,
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.960]   I mean, yeah, I have it on Lexa on Amazon. They have to be in the same room with the device.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:45.920]   Yeah, so the app. So what I keep a Kindle fire next to my Alexa because it shows the apps and
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.480]   they actually you can then vote. You could say says, did I do a good job? You say yes or no.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:55.600]   Here you go. So the skills to here. Here it is. I got it fart for me. Oh, oh, this is because I
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:01.360]   asked for so so here you go. I said fart for me and it didn't. So I can say to the Alexa do what
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.840]   you want to know. But that's probably because I didn't turn on the skills. So let's go here and
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:16.800]   look. This is is such a long thing now. There are 24 pages of skills. Daily information, rock
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.440]   paper. You could play rock paper scissors. I play Jeopardy. I'll give you six Jeopardy questions.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:26.000]   That's official. That's from the Bart status. You could say, what's the Bart status? There's a
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.560]   Super Bowl trivia quiz. Alexa opened the magic door. I'm sorry. Didn't say that.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.920]   I'm making it. Do you trouble that? It's a magic eight ball. Let me let me search for it.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.440]   I think you should have an Alexa on the desk as part of the show. I'm thinking I'm going to buy
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:50.320]   one for yeah. So here it is. Alexa asked for a fart. What's enabled? I just didn't ask for a
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.960]   fart the right way. So next time I will say Alexa asked for a fart. Oh, I'm sorry. I said it again.
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:02.640]   See if we bring one into studio though, the real name is Amazon. We'll know when we accidentally
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.160]   trigger. Yeah, because it'll start to look at it. I'm going to order one right now.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.360]   But now you did notice there was an update to the terms and agreements on the AWS.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:15.440]   Oh, yeah. It's in the rundown. They had a big change in the terms. Oh, no.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:23.760]   One of the things they included is where to go. So it talks about the, you know, you can't use it
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.320]   for nuclear facilities, manned spacecraft, military use and connection with live combat. However,
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.720]   fair enough. However, this restriction will not let me put it up here.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:37.680]   Apparently you can't you can't there's a zombie apocalypse. Yeah, this this restriction will not
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.680]   apply in the event of the occurrence certified by the United States Center of Disease Control
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:48.080]   or successor body of a wide viral infection transmitted via bites or contacted with bodily
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:53.120]   fluid that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living flesh, blood, brain,
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.760]   or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization. In that case,
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:05.440]   have had it. I love it. I love it. I was thinking about that. I wonder whether you have a joke
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:11.520]   like that in there with the lawyers. Did that have to go up to Jeff Bezos? Ah, I would be mad
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.080]   if I were Jeff Bezos and I didn't get to approve that didn't know about that. Yeah.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:22.080]   Amazon also announced something new called lumber yard that I am very intrigued by.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:33.280]   This is a this is a game platform. So it's a free cross platform 3D game engine
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.360]   tightly integrated with Twitch. Remember Amazon acquired twitch? Everybody was like,
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:44.400]   what are they going to do with that? It has you know, plugins galore. Here's a game ready
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:51.440]   wilderness assets. In case you need to build a forest scene. Beach City asset package, including
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:08:00.720]   1950s, jukeboxes and others. This is fascinating to me. So if you've been a if you're a game dev
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:07.440]   or a kid, see this is what I find interesting. If you're a kid who wants to develop games,
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.960]   Amazon's just going to basically enable this for you. Wow. Wow. I'm impressed. Yeah.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:20.960]   Ready to use art assets. You don't even have to be a designer. You can you know, you don't
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:27.680]   I wouldn't know how to design it a woodland forest. You don't have to just download the
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.160]   textures in your set even support multiplayer games. Yeah.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:39.920]   We live in like I said, this is an amazing time to be a kid because you can you know,
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.760]   and I think it's probably a fairly logical step from doing Minecraft. Then you get about 18 or 19
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:51.280]   and you say, I want to do something, you know, 3D rendered. Yeah. First person shooter. Yeah.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.640]   And because it works with Twitch,
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:09:01.920]   you're kind of already socially and it's socially enabled. I'm going to have to play around with
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.880]   this. I love doing, you know, map development for games and things like that. I always found
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.680]   that really interesting. So and my kids now are picking that up with Minecraft and with other
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.320]   games. They're like, Hey, could I make my own map for this game or, you know, could I make a
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.520]   multiplayer map that people that my friends can get on? And so they're getting into it too. And
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:26.560]   this sounds really cool. And again, like all AWS services, in case of zombie attack, you could
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:34.160]   continue to use the game engine and run nuclear generators or
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:44.720]   this lumber yard is kind of mind boggling. They have the Crytek engine. And that's for crisis,
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.600]   right? That's the best. That's why it is. That's one of the best ones. I mean,
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.240]   you're getting access to the like top of the line. Yeah. And yeah, for sure.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.560]   I mean, Unreal Engine is probably the most part. And they recently announced that they were
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.280]   not not for they would give away for free up to a certain point. And then when you start taking
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.720]   revenue, you you owe some money, but you can get started for free on Unreal Engine 4 now.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:12.320]   This says free to download no seat fees, no subscription fees, no requirement to share revenue.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:19.760]   No requirement to share. It's free free. Huh. And then it has a Twitch chat play. You can use
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.880]   drag and drop visual scripting to create gameplay features that let Twitch Twitch viewers use
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.000]   chat to impact the game they're watching. So this is probably similar to technology that they use
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.360]   on Twitch when you're Twitch plays Pokemon. Yeah. So that the chat actually talks to the CryEngine.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:44.000]   Yeah. So it's saying the Amazon will make money off Amazon Web Services that developers use
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.760]   to build or support their games. That's how they're going to make money. They give this away for free
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.080]   and they say, "Oh, well, you're going to need a place to run it." So run it on AWS. Wow.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:59.440]   GameLift has $1.50 per 1000 daily active user fee in addition to standard fees for any other
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:06.400]   Amazon Web Services used, I guess three or whatever. What language do I write things? Is it C++ or
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.120]   is there a scripting language? I know. Is it all GUI? Is it all?
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.240]   The images make it look like it's all GUI, but it can't be, right?
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:20.240]   They do have a managed service that you pay for for deploying operating and scaling
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:25.200]   server based online games using AWS. GameLift and that's going to cost you. But affordable,
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:33.760]   about 50 per 1000 daily active users. Amazing. I wish I had the skills to use this kind of stuff,
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.960]   but I'm sure there are kids, if you're watching, learn the right code.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.480]   Yeah. Absolutely.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.520]   When I left design games.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.280]   Or maybe not because everything's going to become popular.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.280]   You don't even need the right code. You may not. There's going to be something you need to,
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:56.960]   some logic you need to add to your game. But this looks really good. I'm going to have to give
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.880]   this a try. I told you, I like to do maps and things for games. I did a half-life map.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:09.840]   When I left one of my jobs, it was a copacetic, I was leaving the job, go someplace else, and
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:15.040]   they said, "What do you want to do for your last day?" And I said, "I'm going to make a map of the
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.280]   office and we're all going to get on. I'm going to come around and load half-life on all the
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.680]   computers and we're all just going to have a big game in there." Oh, what fun. It was awesome.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.240]   You know, someone's like, "I'm in the conference room." And it's like, "Are you really in the
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.560]   conference room?" No, no, I'm on the game in the conference room. It was a blast. I still have
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.920]   that map around someplace. So you use the tool within half-life to make it. I did use the mapping
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:42.960]   tool. Is that fairly easy to use? Well, this has been ages, right? This was 19, well, 2000, I guess,
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.760]   when I did this. So it was ages, and it was not easy to use. It took hours and hours and hours.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:55.520]   But it was fun. I think it's probably gotten a lot easier. Yeah. It's the end of Flash, as we know it.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:02.320]   Finally. Finally, Google's display ads will be all HTML5 by January 2017.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:10.640]   This means, yeah, I mean, it doesn't mean Flash won't appear elsewhere, but Google does drive a
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:15.600]   lot of the advertising on the net. No more punch the monkey kids unless you could do it in HTML5.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:22.640]   Yeah, that's goodness right there. Although, AdWords does have automatic converters.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:30.560]   So many people just take their flash ads and convert them into HTML5. It is really the beginning,
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:37.120]   even Adobe is acknowledging that Flash is gone. Speaking of ad blocking,
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:46.480]   were we always Google had initially, as you may remember, pulled apps like AdBlockfast,
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:54.320]   stalling updates for others in the Google Play Store. The folks who developed AdBlockfast appealed,
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:00.320]   and now Google has reapproved and republished its app to Google Play, perhaps reversing their
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:09.840]   decision to block ad blocking in the Play Store. I wish they'd block the blocking, but
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.840]   block the blocking too much to ask. Yeah, the problem is it looks like a conflict of interest.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.320]   It just reaffirms what everybody says. Oh, Google's an ad company. Of course they're not.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.480]   Well,
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:32.560]   Samsung's pulling an Apple, they're doing a Content Blocker API for the Samsung browser on their
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.680]   phones. I think the message is clear. People want to be able to block ads.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:46.800]   Google's got to figure out a better way. Maybe AMP is it. Maybe AMP is the solution.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:04.800]   Putin's Internet czar is not a job. You call the head of the Internet in Russia a czar?
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.160]   Oh, what the heck. What the heck?
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:16.880]   German Klimenko. He was named Putin's Internet Advisor six weeks ago,
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:25.280]   and he's been in an interview peppered with expletives. He's been slashing out at American
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:30.640]   tech companies. Klimenko said forcing Google and Apple to pay more taxes and banning Microsoft
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:37.360]   Windows from government computers are necessary measures according to Bloomberg Business, which
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:44.560]   apparently one unwiggling or unable to repeat the language Klimenko used, but they say he explained
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.680]   it in terms of barnyard economics and marital infidelity.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:55.920]   If you could figure that out, we are breathing the cow, says Klimenko. We are breathing the cow
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:04.640]   and they are milking it. We didn't know cow. Are you breathing a cow and then we're milking it?
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:10.720]   Of course, they want to of course raise taxes on US companies so that Russian competitors like
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:17.600]   Yandex and mail.ru can succeed with by offering a less expensive service.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:26.080]   When you buy a name from Google player, the app store anywhere in Europe,
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:33.520]   Vantage charged value added tax in place of a place of payment, but not here in our banana
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:47.920]   republic. It's amazing. You can't compete tax. We're talking about the Forbes list of richest men
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.760]   in the world or just people in the world. And Calacanis on Twitter said, "Yeah, but the number one
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:59.040]   richest person in the world is not on that list. It's led to me of Putin because he basically owns
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:07.600]   Russia." And I guess you could say that in a way. A lawsuit, a class action lawsuit,
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:18.400]   accusing Google of capture fraud has been dismissed out of hand. The lawsuit alleges fraud because
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.000]   Google sometimes requires people wanting a free Gmail account to fill out a two-word capture.
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.400]   Captures that thing where you can hardly read the words, but in theory, a robot, a computer
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:35.120]   program couldn't read it at all. So it's a way of detecting whether you're a human or
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:41.440]   some automated process generating lots of Gmail accounts. The class action said Google is committing
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:46.240]   fraud by forcing people opening a Gmail account to decipher the two words because
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:55.200]   this is actually kind of interesting. The second word is actually a word that they can't OCR and
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.560]   they want you to actually do this. This came out of Carnegie Mellon. This was the really clever
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:05.600]   idea to do two word captures. One word is really generated by the computer. They know what it is,
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.720]   but the other one comes from an OCR, perhaps with Google Books or whatever,
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:16.880]   or Maps trying to decipher a street sign. I can't figure it out. So it puts it in the capture,
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:20.400]   and some human will actually say, "Oh, yeah, that looks like Main Street."
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.120]   Ooh, how many times have you seen those ones that look like house numbers? You know that's
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.920]   coming from Google Maps where they can't figure out what this house is?
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.280]   Yeah, the photo. I've been getting those more and more often lately, photos.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:37.840]   That feels a little creepy. To me, interpreting what the word is felt like, "Oh, I'm doing my
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:43.280]   civic duty. I'm helping to interpret what this word is." Then when they started doing the photos
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:49.760]   of people's addresses, I'm like, "This is just creepy. I feel like a stalker. I don't want to
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.920]   tell you what that guy's house number is. Someone's going to abduct him or something."
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:59.040]   U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley dismissed the suit saying, "Plaintiff has not
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.480]   alleged any facts that plausibly suggest the few seconds it takes to type a second word is
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.760]   something for which a reasonable consumer would expect to receive compensation."
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.080]   Google's behavior is not immoral and impressive because the harm--
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.720]   The fact that the judge had to go that far to point that out.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:19.840]   Excuse me, this is not immoral and oppressive because the harm, if any, of typing a single word
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.320]   without knowledge of how Google profits from such conduct does not outweigh the benefit.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.840]   Man, the court-- It also plays to that ridiculous beam of if you're not--
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.040]   If you're not-- You're the product. Yeah. If it's free, you're the product.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.120]   Yeah, we can just stop that. Can we just stop saying that? I'm seeing it more now.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:44.400]   Google's profit is not the judge's rights. It's not the only benefit the court considers in this
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:50.080]   balancing test. Completing the prompt also entitles users to a free Gmail account.
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:58.720]   Hello? Moreover, users' transcriptions increase the utility of other free Google services such as
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:03.360]   Google Maps or Google Books. "Plaintiff has failed to allege how these numerous benefits
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:08.880]   outweigh the few seconds it takes to transcribe one word." My God, this judge actually sounds
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:16.560]   intelligent. Silly plaintiff. Silly plaintiff. Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:21.280]   School of Law says the decision ranks as one of the most interesting internet law ruling so far.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:24.880]   In 2016, well, it's only February. Give it time.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.880]   Where was this tried? Where was this-- In San Francisco. Okay, that's why.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:36.640]   Like they obviously even bring this suit to Texas, no offense Texans. It has come to
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:44.400]   attention that Google is using our citizens on behalf of their own evil plans to take over the
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:52.160]   world. The final quote from Judge Corley as Google suggests it strains credulity that plaintiff or
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:58.560]   class members would forgo access to a free Gmail account and hire quality Google Books or Google
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:04.560]   Maps because their brief transcription of a single word might indirectly or directly facilitate
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.400]   Google's profit earning. Who brought this suit? I didn't look for that part.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.880]   It's because she's not a judge in the United States, I mean the United States of Germany,
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:17.440]   a Blurmane. It says-- Who brought the suit?
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:24.640]   --No where Schubert is San Francisco lawyer or Boston attorney Patrick Villelli.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:32.320]   And I don't know who was in the class. You know what? Lawyers are always looking for
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:38.000]   something to do when this is spare time. And get a couple of hours. Maybe I should file
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.120]   Gabriella Rovos-Losano individually on behalf of all other persons
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:49.920]   similarly situated plaintiff versus Google. Plaintives.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.160]   Not a money that's wasted on that. Allegiance.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:55.120]   The following facts upon personal knowledges to herself in her own acts.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.680]   Google, she says it's just too much tumble and they're making money on this.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:06.240]   I love it that the judges said, "Yeah, forget."
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:12.480]   A resident of Williamstown, Massachusetts in August 24 while living in Massachusetts,
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:17.440]   Ms. Rovos-Losano signed up for a new Gmail account and had to type two words.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:25.760]   My God! So is everybody who has a Gmail account than a member of the class?
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:30.720]   Class? Hell yes. Yeah. That's when you get that little thing in the mail and it says,
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.840]   "You may be a party to this lawsuit. You could get 25 cents."
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.560]   It was actually in Massachusetts this was pursued.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:45.280]   So Google had to fly a lawyer all the way out there. Now we want some money back.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:56.720]   Oh, I love this one. Speaking of the government, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration,
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:14.160]   Google asked them the NHSTA for NHSNH TSA. Ask them for a ruling on autonomous vehicles.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:20.080]   Who's the driver? Who's driving the car? It's actually the letter. If you read the letter,
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:29.600]   it's great. Let me load it up and have it here in the show notes because I really enjoyed the letter.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:36.880]   Google wants clarification from the, an interpretation from the National Highway
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:42.240]   Traffic Safety Administration regarding a number of provisions in the federal motor vehicle safety
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:53.920]   standards as they apply to Google. Google describes its vehicles. The level four vehicle, autonomous
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:58.400]   full self-driving vehicle is designed to perform all safety critical driving functions and monitor
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.800]   road wear conditions for an entire trip. Such a design anticipates that the driver will provide
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.760]   destination or navigation input but is not expected to be available for control at any time
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.240]   during the trip. Both occupied and unoccupied vehicles by design, safe operation,
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:21.600]   rest solely on the automated vehicle system. Google told the board that we found that humans
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:32.080]   didn't improve things. For vehicles with an AI driver, we preclude any occupant from assuming
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:41.600]   the driving a task. So who's the driver? And they came back with an interpretation. Google said
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:46.800]   there's three ways you could interpret this or two potential interpretations of driver and one
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.640]   potential interpretation for driver position. One, the NHTSA could interpret the term driver is
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.200]   meaningless for the purposes of Google's self-driving vehicle since there's no human driver.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   And consider FMVSS provisions that refer to a driver simply as inapplicable to Google's vehicle
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.240]   design. There's no steering wheel or brake or gas. They can't drive. Or they could interpret
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.200]   driver and operator as referring to the software of the self-driving vehicle or three, they could
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:21.920]   interpret the driver's position or some designated seating position as referring to the left front
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.760]   on board seating position regardless of whether the occupant of that position is able to control
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.840]   the vehicle. In other words, you'd be the driver even though you couldn't drive just because you're
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:36.880]   sitting there. So there was, this is a great, it's a fascinating thing to read. And actually,
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:44.160]   again, this is another case of government getting it right. They went on and on, they talked about
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:49.520]   the pros and cons and basically decided, you know who's the driver? The software's a driver.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:56.240]   And for purposes of the law, the actual self-driving system is the driver.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.960]   Well, you could have just sent them the definition for autonomous.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:08.320]   It's called an autonomous vehicle. I agree. You understand why Google wanted this clarification.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:12.480]   I mean, it has to do with insurance, it has to do with liability. That means Google's level.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:21.920]   The driver caused an accident. Right. The driver, the algorithm's driver,
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.480]   who did the algorithm? Right. Hello, Google.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.400]   So will Google self-insure?
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:36.640]   Well, there's still the senior analyst for Kelly Blue Book, Karl Brouwer,
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.520]   asked exactly these questions. If the NHTSA has prepared to name artificial intelligence
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.160]   as a viable alternative to human controlled vehicles, it could streamline the presses of
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:50.560]   putting autonomous vehicles on the road. It's a terrain test, terrain never thought of.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.840]   The next question is whether and how Google would certify that the self-driving system
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:57.520]   meets a standard developed and designed to apply to a vehicle with a human driver. Actually,
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:03.200]   this is the NHTSA talking. Google is still evaluating the response. I took me a while to read it.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:08.560]   And they've said they'll likely partner with established automakers to build self-driving cars.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:14.720]   Yeah, so it's not going to be Google, they get some trouble. It's going to be Toyota or...
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.480]   I've been reading the manual for the car that I will someday get called a Tesla.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:24.400]   And the self-driving stuff. And it says there is a sensor in the steering wheel
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.160]   that will sense whether your hands on the steering wheel and you need to keep your hands on the
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.960]   steering wheel or the self-driving capability will disengage. That's how Tesla solves this,
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:37.120]   is saying you're the driver. Yep. Are you steering at that moment? No.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.600]   But you must be touching the wheel.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   And they have a summon feature where you're not in the car, you summon the car,
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.280]   it pulls out of the garage and picks you up. Is that working already? Oh yeah.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:55.040]   But they say do not use this anywhere but you're driveway because it's illegal.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:01.840]   That's outside of your driveway. But you can... Yeah, oh yeah, there's videos on YouTube of
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:05.280]   happening. The woman who's a little scary since the car is so silent.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.400]   Well, and then what's interesting moves really slowly. It'll also park, not only parallel,
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:15.920]   but it'll not... But it'll do perpendicular parking. So if you can't get out... If you look at a space
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:19.600]   and say, "Well, if I park there, I'm not going to be able to get out," you just get out of the car
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.920]   and you say, "Park in there." And I've seen videos and it just moves very slowly but it just...
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:31.280]   Now who's... Now who's the driver, Captain Phillips? Jeez. I like how it plugs itself in.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.280]   Yeah, that's not... I don't think that's actually working yet but I think that would be very cool.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.880]   I think that's the idea of the summon car across the country. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.800]   It would have to because it has to charge up.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.800]   Yeah, no, you're not there yet. But the good wife covered self-driving cars.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:48.240]   Who's responsible for an accident? Do they resolve it for us all?
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.920]   They had a segment on it and when you get there, you'll love it.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:57.440]   So the good wife is ending. Yeah. Seven seasons?
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.240]   I loved her. Yeah, she's great.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:00.720]   Better bet.
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:12.320]   India says internet.org violates net neutrality and is illegal and they're shutting down
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:18.880]   free basics which is the nicely renamed internet.org. It's free basics.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:22.320]   Mark Zuckerberg says, "You're not keeping us out of India."
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.960]   Now you just were talking about this with somebody, right, Jeff?
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:33.280]   Yeah, so the guy who started this nickel pow-wow is the founder of amazing, amazing young guy who
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:39.520]   used to work for paid content.org for Raffa Ali and then started his own media site called Media
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:45.920]   Nama in India. I met him when I was in Delhi and he's a really, really wonderful guy, very smart,
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:52.800]   very connected. And when internet.org came along, he had a fit about it saying this violates
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.760]   net neutrality. It's zero rating. It's another form of zero rating.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:59.040]   Exactly. And he said that's just the problem. So zero rating which is a terrible name because
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:06.320]   it's not clear what it is, is what T-Mobile's doing with Ben John and others do this. We're,
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:10.960]   hey, you won't count against your bandwidth. We won't charge you when you consume data from
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:16.080]   these particular services. But it's discriminatory. It's discriminatory. It's zero rating.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:21.760]   India decided that's not okay and they prohibited zero rating.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:27.520]   So, so, so, so, nickel started the campaign and is credited with, with killing internet.org.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:33.680]   And he even ended up in a discussion a few weeks ago with Mark Zuckerberg online. He did,
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:38.720]   you know, op-eds against, he created a credible campaign using all kinds of software to
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:44.720]   organize people, to be able to send emails to their MPs and all kinds of things.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:51.840]   And now has a platform for movements and protests and basically took off the last,
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:56.880]   I think, three months to, essentially, I'm going to start an NGO out of this,
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:59.520]   which is great political movements. And he said, "There's two things politicians care about.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.520]   There's money or votes. We can't control the money. That's what the big companies have.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.560]   But we can make them see the pressure of the votes." And they did and he changed the discussion
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:13.680]   entirely. And interestingly, what I found interesting was that Nichols said he wasn't really fighting
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:18.160]   Facebook. He was fighting the telcos. Yeah, because that's the one I'm worried about.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:22.880]   Yeah, you can't find a position that the telcos are doing this. But Facebook and his view was
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:28.000]   tone deaf in how it approached this. And I said, "Nicolas, is there any, my first question to him,
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.840]   is there any structure you could imagine?" I still like the idea of getting poor people on the internet.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.640]   Well, that's debate with Om Malek, who, of course, has some standing in this. He's Indian,
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.200]   understands the issues. And he really hates internet.org. He says, "No, that's not the internet."
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:47.600]   But my position was, if you're getting information, we get Wikipedia, admittedly,
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:52.560]   Facebook's there, but Wikipedia is also there. Women's health clinics are put online by this.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.760]   Isn't that a good, isn't that a net benefit? That's been my wish, is to find a way to make
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:04.480]   that work without ruining that neutrality, which I believe in fiercely. And Nichols' answer was,
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.000]   the only way to do it in his view is give people bandwidth and let them do what they want,
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.480]   give them credit and say, "Here's a whole bunch of sites that are wonderful, and they're really
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:20.800]   cheap." And you can stretch your rupee a long way by using these sites. But,
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:27.440]   though, you can go to a porn site too, if you want to. And that that's the only way to do it,
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:35.040]   which you're not being discriminatory. And so it is a real challenge, because I think,
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:42.320]   and I said this to him, I think the Zuckerberg's motive was generally good and at face value here.
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:47.760]   That he really wants to bring people on the net. Both Google and Facebook are working on drones
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:55.120]   and satellites and kites to bring internet to remote areas. Now, what Nichols said is,
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:59.600]   yeah, he didn't necessarily argue with that, but he said there's also a clear business benefit
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:06.560]   to Facebook, and that's also very true. And part of the problem, though, in this case,
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:12.240]   it's interesting to me, is he said that the MPs are concerned about how Facebook
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:17.360]   could use, I don't think I said use, but could use its
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:28.560]   power as a gateway to news and content to lobby public and thus political opinion.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:31.600]   Right. Oh, you can imagine all sorts of harms.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:37.760]   Mm hmm. Oh, yeah. And well, and not just in the case of it or not.org, but also in the case of
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:43.040]   this battle. Right. And so this is the discussion we in journalism have with Facebook that they've
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:47.120]   got to deal with. And I think there are answers, but they've got it, they've got to understand
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:51.520]   what the questions are, what the issues are, that when Facebook becomes a primary distributor of
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:59.360]   news and information to people, then it has to decide what the principles are around protecting,
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.480]   open and free information and knowledge in society and democracy and mom and apple pie,
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:12.560]   or, or, you know, whatever it may be that, that we want to protect the society. And so it's true of
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:15.520]   Google and Google has principles around this. And Facebook, I think I have to do some more
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.720]   thinking about this. They need the perspective of people like journalists and public society
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:25.360]   people in this discussion. They need to, they need to have an open discussion about this. And
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:33.040]   I've said this to them. And I think that that the internet.org case shows that vulnerability,
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:37.600]   that unless you're dealing with a sort of way with principles that you can answer that and say,
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.520]   here's how we're operating and here's why and here's the responsibility we have. It wasn't just a case
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:47.040]   in the net neutrality that came up. Facebook put itself in a position where its role as gatekeeper
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.120]   to information also now becomes a factor. And they're going to deal with that.
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:56.720]   You know, it's interesting. Oh, Malick, who, as I mentioned, is a dead son against this
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:01.680]   road, an interesting piece on his blog in which he said, maybe I'm suspicious because my family
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:07.840]   has told me their personal story of the British Raj and the, and the story of how a commercial
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:13.360]   spearhead, the East India Company came bearing gifts and then became the symbol of British imperialism.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:18.560]   It's interesting. So the historical precedent for this is, you know, hey, we got good stuff for
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:23.360]   you for free. Well, that's what Mark Andree is in trying to step in. Yeah, Mark, Mark tweeted some
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:30.560]   tweets. Yeah. So this is, you were mentioning this earlier. This is the latest kerfuffle.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:37.600]   Mark a master of Twitter genius at Twitter steps in and gives what he fixes a simple opinion and
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:42.560]   Oh, there was a fire. And this was my opinion. I mean, I'm going to say it. You know, there is
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:47.920]   something to be said for at least a little internet better than no internet. Mark tweeted denying
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:53.040]   the world's poorest free partial internet connectivity when today they have none for
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:36:00.560]   ideological reasons strikes me as morally wrong. Then he went on. That's the next one that got
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:07.920]   him in trouble. And uh, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, down, down, down, down. That's the one.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:13.280]   So there's response Benedict Evans responds. It's a terrible thing to offer people with no money,
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:18.560]   the choice of something free. And then V crumb chakra says that sounds like justification for
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:24.960]   internet colonialism. Then Andreeson responds anti colonialism has been economically catastrophic
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:34.160]   for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now? Oops. Then what happened? So then there was huge
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:40.880]   viewer on Twitter in India. And Andreeson had to back way up. He apologized. Yeah,
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:46.800]   Facebook, uh, you know, adamantly said we don't forget addresses on the board of Facebook. So he
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:51.760]   wasn't just speaking this individual. He was seen and sometimes you're speaking from Facebook.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.080]   And so Facebook says we have nothing to do this. We completely disagree with it. Yeah,
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:00.240]   for us. And then Andreeson had a great quote this morning. He said I am henceforth going to
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:05.200]   leave discussion about complex Indian matters to those who know much better than I do. Yeah.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:11.440]   And yeah, as I do, I do, that's one of the reasons I got turned around on this is home convinced me,
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:16.480]   not because of his the merit of his arguments, because I really wasn't sure I agreed with those,
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:21.760]   but just because he has stature and standing in this. Yeah, I don't. Last line on Twitter says
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.000]   Andreeson, I made an ill informed and ill advice comment about Indian politics and economics.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.960]   To be clear, I'm 100% opposed to colonialism and 100% in favor of independence and freedom
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:35.680]   in any country, including India. I'm a huge admirer of the nation in India and the Indian people have
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.120]   been nothing but kind and generous to me for many years. I apologize for my any offense, my
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.920]   common cause and withdraw and full and without reservation. That's a good good good apology. Yeah,
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.920]   I will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:52.480]   and experience than me. I don't even know what his tweet meant. I mean,
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:38:02.000]   what how can you assert the think that the fight against colonialism has been harmful
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.320]   economically catastrophic to the Indian people? Well, when it was some time, wouldn't allow foreign
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:14.000]   companies to invest things like that. And this would be another example of being
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.000]   sensitive to this, right? Yeah, exactly. You couldn't get foreign brands in the Coca-Cola
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.000]   wasn't in India for years. There were fake Coca-Cola's in there. Yeah. And so finally,
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.240]   when it was opened up to international markets and investment and such, I think this is what
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:33.360]   Mark's saying. Look how much better things were when you tried to fight against too far against
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:38.880]   the colonialism that in fact did depress them didn't do much good. So now you're trying to,
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:42.240]   you know, worry about and fight against Facebook, you know, is that the best thing to do?
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.640]   But I'm getting folks, I'm not saying this. I'm just trying to interpret just to be clear. I'm
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:52.560]   not saying anything. Yeah. But I think that's why that's why I interpreted what he was saying.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:58.880]   But yes, it's a classic, classic case of you can't make a complex argument in one tweet.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.040]   Right. I guess the first time I've seen Andreson do a major skin back.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.480]   Good. I think that he's been brilliant on Twitter and generally, you know, if you've gone that
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:12.160]   long and said that much and you've only screwed up once, that's not bad.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.520]   Well, I'm sure there are those who will find other scrups.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:20.960]   Well, he's not one of the president. This could well be a new form of imperialism,
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:26.560]   right? Intellectual or internet imperialism doesn't have to be geographic.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:31.840]   Yeah. No, that's the fear. Yeah. And it is our burden as white men.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:36.480]   And it's the further fear of what, you know, Putin's internet czar is going to do and China's
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.880]   going to do it. And it's going to split up internet. And France is doing right now giving
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.840]   new rules on Facebook around. And Google is the story on the rundown.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:49.520]   Google is now going to scrub results more because of the right to be forgotten decision,
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:55.360]   which makes us separate and different internet in Europe, a less complete internet there,
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:01.760]   which is just appalling. Yeah, I was announced. We knew they were to do layoffs. We heard about
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.280]   it on their earnings call last week. They've announced their first round of layoffs,
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:15.040]   15% of the workforce, 1500 jobs. Wednesday's an answer to layoff the first 107 effective April 11th
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:21.280]   employees getting 60 days advanced notice. They filed with the California Employment
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.360]   Development Department, the layoffs spread across a range of departments and job titles.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:33.760]   Polishing up Yahoo for sale, getting the baby, stanching the bleeding.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:41.200]   And it's in German. So I don't know what it means, but there's breaking Gutenberg news.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:49.680]   I just wasn't that a proxy moron. Has there really been any breaking news about
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:56.000]   Gutenberg? This is a big deal. This is a this is a this is a what is this? This is
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.440]   the it's the mindset, history, the history of the state of minds.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.640]   Yes. So what what have I just saw this on Facebook? And I just I was just putting this in here.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:19.200]   The state archive of Wertzburg found a document from February 26 1468 that refers directly to
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:28.400]   what was the quote I put in here. Certain forms, letters, instruments and stuff that had come from
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:36.560]   the printing work that belonged to Johann Gutenberg and that after his death, he he gave on. So this
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:41.520]   is a this is very little documentary evidence. And this comes out of the fight that Gutenberg had,
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:45.120]   which I've talked about in the show before with Johann Foust. And I'm sure you're all up to speed
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:52.720]   on this who had had funded Gutenberg and he lost much of the business, but he kept some materials
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:58.480]   and left that to others. So this is actually in Gutenberg geek world, which is about three of us.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:03.200]   This is big news. This is a nice a nice historical find.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:08.720]   Thank you for for allowing me that little moment of Gutenberg moments. We can move on now.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:14.960]   By the way, the reference to white man's burden had nothing was an ironic reference.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:21.680]   Oh, I you know, you get bit by people who know, know a history and so they go, oh, he just said
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:26.000]   white man's burden. It's lucky. I didn't say the rest of that, which was, you know, those
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.520]   wogs really need us to help them get their lives in order.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:37.680]   I am sad to hear this. The bits blog is shuttering on the New York Times.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.080]   New York Times has killed blog after blog after blog after blog and eventually they'll just be
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:47.440]   not there. Maybe I don't know. There's still do the content though, right? Yeah. Yeah. So it's
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:52.240]   just not going to be separated out into a blog, but the idea to go to that brand that was bits and
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:55.920]   the bits has a voice and bits is something you can have a relationship with. I think it's kind of
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:02.160]   having the exact wrong way. I think that the big one size fits all products must split up into
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:09.360]   a bunch of more relevant and targeted products and they're doing the opposite. So did stuff in the
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:14.880]   bits blog get in the printed paper? I don't know how much bits blog did, but yes, I mean, certainly
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:19.200]   one form or another, absolutely the blogs since the beginning. And that was that was a pretty
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:24.320]   revolutionary thing because I had a great discussion with the then editor of the New York Times about
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:31.760]   blogs that went on forever. It's somewhere online. Bill Keller and, you know, New York Times was
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:35.680]   stiffy about blogs. And then they started doing it. The tech writer Saul Hansel was one of the very
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:41.040]   first and it was a huge note that some of the stuff that Saul wrote on the blog did actually appear
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.760]   in print. So it took the blog voice and put it in the gray old lady voice and it started to change
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:52.240]   the entire voice at the times. Blogs had a huge impact on the times and its relationship to its
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:57.520]   public. So that's why I'm just sad. I'm more than full to see them basically go there.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:06.000]   But content will remain. It's just the reporting and some form or another will be there. But will
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.600]   it have the same voice? Can I subscribe to the bits blog and know the authors and all that? No,
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:18.320]   that's that's gone. It'll just the content will just be called tech. Yeah, exactly. I have to say,
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:24.880]   the word blog seems antiquated. Yeah, it does. Oh, now, now, now as a blogger, Jeff,
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:30.640]   goes, wait a minute. I don't like the word podcast. I think naming content,
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:35.600]   giving content a description based on how it's distributed is antiquated, right?
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:45.600]   Content's content. But content is a concept is antiquated too. Oh, no. What's replacing content?
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.280]   Flow.
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:54.800]   For the state of whiter would say a river. Flow.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:01.440]   Be careful with your USB-C cables. We've been watching the posts of the Amazon. Haven't you?
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:08.160]   It's so fun. Benson Long, Leung from Google's been buying every USB-C cable we could find. And
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:11.520]   then if it doesn't live up to the spec, which means it could be actively dangerous
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:18.240]   for your USB-C powered device, he writes a review on Amazon. I refuse to buy USB-C cables now,
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:24.400]   unless I see Benson's seal of approval. Does he say it's okay? He fried his laptop.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:30.640]   Yeah, no, seriously. And it's great. In fact, I just bought a USB-C cable.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:38.560]   And somebody sent me a link saying, because I was looking for the USB-3,
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:44.160]   those weird dimple cable they call it a mic. I can't remember the name of it. There's a name
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.440]   for it. Anyway, somebody sent me a link to one and I looked and I said, I can't buy that one. Benson
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:52.480]   Long says that's a terrible one. But then I searched some more and Belkin makes one that Benson
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:58.720]   approves. So this is the new thing. Do not buy a USB-C cable unless Benson approves it.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:07.360]   It's so cool. He's tested so many of them. Apparently, a bad USB-C destroyed his Chromebook
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:11.280]   pixel. Yeah, that's what I was saying. I presume Google gave him another one because it's worth
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:14.720]   that thing. Well, Peter Bone, who's writing about this in the verse, said it happened to me too.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:20.560]   Really? Yeah, on his 6P. I used a cheap cable I found on Amazon to charge my Nexus 6P.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:25.760]   It drew too much power for my MacBook Airs, USB ports. They shut down temporarily to protect
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:30.320]   themselves. But when they came back online, they only worked intermittently. Wow.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:41.120]   Yeah. I'm sitting here with my Chromebook Pixel and my Pixel-C and my Nexus 6P phone all on USB-C.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.800]   So I do not buy anything unless I see Benson in the reviews of that cable say, "Okay."
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:55.120]   And then he, some Redditors have created a website with an or a Google spreadsheet, your choice,
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:02.640]   aggregating his reviews, client or not compliant. You definitely need that.
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:08.400]   Because, you know, but the good news is whenever he does put a review on Amazon,
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:12.640]   it's immediately voted up to the top. So you usually don't have to scroll down to find it.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:15.760]   You would think this would be something that would have been simply taken care of in the
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:20.160]   standard itself. It is. They're not up to the standard. That's the point. They leave out a
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:24.800]   critical resistor in some cases. Well, so here's the question though, but all USB-2
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:31.440]   cables couldn't do that damage. And it's just is something inherently the design of USB-C that's
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:35.680]   more dangerous? No, you could do this with USB-2. If you had something that drew the
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:41.200]   differences, you're not drawing enough amperage with the USB-2. Usually those devices don't draw
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:45.440]   enough amperage. But now you're powering laptops with a pixel or a MacBook. Yeah,
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.880]   you're drawing a lot more amps over that cable. And when you do that, that cable is going to heat
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:55.760]   up if it's not thick enough. So we've done that in our makerspace. Lots of heavy.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:00.880]   Oh, yeah. Not with USB-C, just with sending too much power over a too thin of a cable.
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.560]   And it doesn't. It's not price specific. You really just have to look and see if it was made
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:10.480]   properly. I would imagine that this will, at some point resolve itself because people will
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:17.520]   not buy the back cables. But this is a good, good tip. Everybody should look for this.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:24.720]   Now, let's solve this hoverboard problem. I've taken to putting our hoverboard out in the back
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:32.880]   yard and charging it outside. Our CPA firm, one of the partners in our CPA firm, had her hoverboard
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:40.800]   explode here in Petaluma a couple of weeks ago. Throwing chunks of hot lithium ion throughout the
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:47.440]   throughout the room, her husband and daughter were in the house. Thank God they weren't standing
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:52.720]   next to it. They would have been, you know, damaged. $30,000 of fire damage. FBI were actually out
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:59.120]   invested. So, Leo, yeah, babe. Yeah. You really want to use an auditor or use the hoverboard?
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:06.160]   No, it's for a daughter. Oh, okay. Just maybe a little too loosey, loosey California.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:13.040]   Hey, man. I got you. You should see these kids on the hoverboards, man. They just go whizzing
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:19.520]   around. Michael's so good. He just goes, so be careful on the hoverboards. Yeah.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:29.600]   Actually, you L you L labs have started certifying hoverboards now. So that they do USB cables too.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.960]   Yeah, I wish they would. Yeah. Yeah. Charging with a USB. So if you're going to if you're going to buy
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:44.160]   a hoverboard, wait because they haven't yet started certifying them. But they're going to start certifying.
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:50.480]   I love. Yeah. We give some credit, some props to you. Well, the under Loretta's labs who
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:56.480]   certify all the electronics we use and you know, they're much safer because of that, right? Yeah.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:59.600]   Love you. Well,
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:07.760]   fortunately, there are many things you can do to protect yourself from such an incident.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:11.440]   He looks like he's been spending a lot of times testing overcharge the hoverboard.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:15.840]   Electron manufacturers recommended charging times found in the product manual.
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:21.120]   Somebody said it wouldn't be a problem except for the cheap Chinese knockoff hoverboards.
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.440]   They're all Chinese. There's nobody makes a hoverboard in the US. It's all.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:32.160]   It's every hoverboard is made in China by probably 50 different countries all knocking off each other.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:38.960]   There's no official. But aren't the ones with the Samsung batteries better or safer?
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:45.360]   Do we know? We don't even know. Aaron? No. I mean, they could be, right? But how do you know the
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:48.720]   charging circuit where that came from? So you get a good battery. But if it's over charge,
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.600]   any battery overcharged is going to. Well, not anybody. And there are American companies selling
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:57.120]   these, but they're just rebranding Chinese hoverboards. They're not.
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.360]   Where do the parts come from? Yeah. How are they designed?
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:05.920]   I'm scared to death of our hoverboard. Now. I'm way too clumsy. Period. I'm like,
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:10.240]   you know what? They're easy. Oh, not for me. I thought, oh, I'm not getting on this. This
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:15.360]   trivial. The only problem is I've been spoiled by my segue way because you use your body weight
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:18.960]   steer the segue. This you use your toes. You lean your foot back and forward.
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:24.560]   Rich. You know, Rick's fallen one of the photographer who did this day in life, American, all that.
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:29.520]   He got on one of 30 seconds, fell off and basically broke his wrist. Yeah. What? Oh, I know, Rick. I
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:35.280]   love Rick. Eric's wonderful. You should graduate to the segue hoverboard. A little guy. They're
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:41.520]   coming in. We're going to have them on. Oh, the new screen savers. It's you don't steer it with
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:48.480]   your feet. You steer it with your calves, your thighs. There's a little rod that sticks up. Oh,
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:54.160]   but the rod also can be converted to a following robot. It can convert into a robot with additional
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:59.120]   accessories, especially success, accessories sold separately. Can I ask you guys a question? Yeah.
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:04.240]   On the US back to the USBC for a second. On the list, there's no USBC to USBC.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:11.360]   But they make them. I bought them. I need them. I use them. There's nothing on here. Can
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:17.760]   imagine why that's not on there? There's A to C. There's a micro B, AC charges. That's just,
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:21.760]   this list was just made by somebody. So what I would do is go to Amazon.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.640]   Look for one of the C. And look for one of the, you know what? He's
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:32.320]   USB C to USB C. I have plenty of them. And I know they're all right. I wouldn't have bought them.
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:38.320]   Let's find one. Here's an anchor like anchor. In fact, I love anchor.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:42.160]   Usually a good brand. USB C. Let's go down. Look at the reviews though. Don't buy it without
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:47.600]   looking down here and see if Benson says it's okay. Oh, there's no review. So he's either
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:56.400]   not tested them or for some reason the review is not, not there. Huh. Huh. But anchor is usually
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:01.040]   pretty good. Usually. Yep. I can't imagine anchor would. I usually buy anchor, anchor,
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.840]   USB two cables for all my stuff. Yeah. Anchor batteries. Yeah.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.680]   If anchor made a hoverboard, I'd buy their hoverboards.
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:17.200]   You know what? I don't see. I do. Well, you know, Amazon reviews are useful, but
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:22.480]   I don't see. Maybe Benson doesn't. Maybe he doesn't check. Right. Check these. I don't know.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:32.640]   I get the braided cables. I really like those. And for USB C, I get different colors. So I will know.
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:35.600]   Yeah. I don't see any Benson reviews on here.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:46.880]   Mr. Benson. Mr. Benson. All right. Let's take a break and we will get your tips and numbers and
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:57.360]   we will get a demo. Yes. Something very cool that Mr. Newcomb has brought us. Texture is so cool.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:03.280]   I'm a texture subscriber. Actually, I subscribe back when they were called next issue. They're now
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:09.200]   next issue by texture by next issue or something like that. Same idea. It's Netflix for magazines,
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:15.280]   basically, for your iPad or your phone or your tablet. You download the app, you subscribe,
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:22.480]   and it's all you can read of the best magazines. And I love this because, hey,
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:27.520]   I like magazines. I think magazine writing is still some of the best writing out there.
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:34.560]   But I don't want to buy the magazine. That'll really add up. And I don't want to subscribe
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:39.840]   because that's going to add to the clutter. So I like reading them online or but not everything's
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:45.280]   online. So this is a really great solution in every category. So it's almost always every month.
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:51.440]   I want to read an article that's in Wired. I like the pictures in National Geographic.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:57.280]   I might want to read an article in Rolling Stone or Vanity Fair, rarely more than one.
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:04.880]   I don't want to. This is the way to do it. They've got literally dozens. In fact, if you go to
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:12.960]   texture t-e-x-t-u-r-e.com/twig, you can try it for free and you can see the two plans. There's a
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:20.080]   $15 a $10 a month plan, different magazines available. You'll be downloading not only the
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:27.920]   current issue, but back issues. You can download it and go offline, which is nice. The magazines are
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:32.560]   exactly like the magazines on the newsstand. Every page, every article, but it's easier to
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:36.400]   navigate. For instance, if you've got the cover page, you can just click an article you want to
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:41.920]   read from the cover and go right into it. They also have an editorial team recommending daily
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:48.240]   stories and a collections list. They call it their curated collections that let you pick a topic and
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:53.520]   then read articles across a variety of magazines about that topic. Styling tips from GQ and Esquire,
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:59.520]   workouts from men's health or men's fitness, Forbes or Fortune, stay in the know. It's all there.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:12.560]   I love it. I want you to try it free at texture.com/twig. If you travel a lot, if you're looking for
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:16.880]   a way to keep up on the magazines without the clutter, without killing the trees,
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:24.640]   texture.com/twig. Is the magazine business in the same kind of straights as the newspaper business?
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:30.640]   I get to sense some magazines do find yet. Yeah. A lot of print magazines,
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:34.720]   cutting-ass magazines where I used to work, vogue and such, just to make money, but they recognize
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:41.200]   certainly they've got to be online and be digital. I've long contended that magazines
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:44.480]   should be better off on the internet because they start with a relationship. They start with
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:48.480]   relevance. I like this magazine. It's not that. I don't think anybody's really done a good enough
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:54.480]   job yet of doing that, but they still think too much about content rather than relationships.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:58.960]   But I think that if they get their act together, they can be well-poised. I mean, there's some
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:04.640]   magazines like the New Yorker that are just, you know, and that's a weekly impossible.
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:08.960]   New Yorker or the Economist, there are Apple, there are things that are in its day, there are
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:16.240]   things that are so good that you can break all the rules. Yeah. Yeah. I love magazines. That's
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:20.480]   why they said like National Geographic. I used to have stacks of them in the basement. Now we don't
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:25.680]   have to do that because you can just, you get it in your, it's actually that's basic or, I think
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:32.800]   somewhere still I have a whole bunch of the ones on DVD or CD-ROM, hardly, CD-ROM. Oh, I remember that.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:38.080]   Yeah. That's when we all thought that was the future of publishing. They're still pitching that on
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:43.600]   public radio. What? Get a CD-ROM? Yeah. Yeah. I was surprised. That's a good idea.
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:49.760]   They had all the mad magazines on CD-ROM, but there is, there can be an issue because it
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:54.560]   depends how they digitize them. Like the mad magazine digitization was not a very well-done
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:58:02.160]   effort, unfortunately. Oh, why am I not surprised? Well, doesn't Conde on them now? I think so.
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:09.840]   All right. Let's see. Let's, how should we do this? Well, I wanted to mention a couple of things.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:17.200]   Remember we were talking about Google Fi. I don't know if I have my
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:24.000]   phone here. And we were saying, how do you know which network you're on when you're on Google Fi?
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.960]   Because Google Fi doesn't expose that. And a number of people tweeted me and wrote to me saying,
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:35.040]   oh, you needed that. There's a special app, probably a number of them, but there was one that almost
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:40.640]   everybody universally recommended that you can run on your phone that will tell, I'm just looking
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:46.640]   for it because I can't remember the name of it now, that will tell you which, there it is,
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:50.720]   signal spy that will tell, actually tells you all sorts of interesting things.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:57.760]   So here's the bands and the carriers. So right now I'm on T-Mobile and I'm making a Wi-Fi call,
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:02.800]   but you can view the network history. So I can see that actually here in Petaluma,
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:09.600]   I don't, I never get connected to Sprint, but this would be really useful to see even to the point
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:16.240]   of the promiscuous connection. So this is promiscuously connecting to a Wi-Fi at a restaurant next door
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:21.440]   to a store I go to. And I don't want to be connected to them promiscuously, but in fact,
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:25.360]   that's one of the things that Google Fi will do if it's an open access point.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:34.800]   So this is a really nice little program, it's called signal spy. If you're a Google Fi user
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:40.240]   and you're trying to keep up on what's going on, now I don't keep it running in boot because
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:44.800]   you know I'm trying to get my battery life up on this phone, but a very useful thing. You can
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:50.080]   even say, you can, one of the things you can do is you can say which dialers you should use
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:53.600]   in preference over what others instead of laying in pick automatically.
[01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:58.560]   Nice little, nice little doohickey. Thank you for all the people sent me a note on that.
[01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:03.360]   And then I just got this book from a no starch press. I love no starch press. They do great stuff.
[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:07.680]   And I'm really excited about this. Learn to program with Minecraft. Now as some of you know,
[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:12.960]   I kind of fell in love with Minecraft and started a Minecraft server of my very own,
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:18.080]   but what I didn't know was that on the Raspberry Pi, the Minecraft there has an interface to fourth.
[02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:24.000]   You can use fourth commands to interface with Minecraft. And that's what this is all about.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.080]   It's a good way to learn fourth, especially for kids who are Minecraft obsessed,
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:34.080]   because when you say to them, well you know what, you could build a rocket ship programmatically,
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.400]   you know, just a few lines of code. You could build a, you know, 100 foot high wall
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:45.040]   to separate your land from other lands. But you just need to know a little code that gets them
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:51.520]   very interested. And this is done by Craig Richardson, who is an educator, uses Python to teach. He's
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:59.040]   taught high school computing classes, led workshops on programming Minecraft with Python. And the
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:02.880]   nice thing is you don't have to have a Raspberry Pi to do this. This will work on Windows, Mac,
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:10.320]   or Linux. He actually gives you the files to download and offers you a very simplified way
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:14.560]   to set up a Minecraft server on your own computer so you can write software and use the idle IDE
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:23.120]   for Python to write code. It's pretty cool. It's, you know, dance parties. This is the,
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:31.360]   you know, teleportation. You show a kid this that you can create a disco floor that lights up when
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:37.520]   you dance around on it. They suddenly say, I'd like to do that. So I really, I've really been
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:43.680]   enjoying this. Very cool. Learn to program with Minecraft. Craig Richardson is the author,
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:46.160]   and it's from no starch press. They do a lot of great stuff.
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:49.360]   I was doing a lot of coding cookbooks. I looked at one of the kids.
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:57.280]   Yeah. I just feel like this is a great way to ease a kid into programming, maybe even better
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:03.120]   than robots. Some kids like that physicality of a robot or the turtle, the logo, turtle graphics,
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:08.320]   and all that. But because kids are already doing stuff in Minecraft, you've shown me some really
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.200]   cool stuff, Aaron, that you do in your maker space with your daughter in Minecraft. For instance,
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.240]   you saw me before the show, she can design a house and send it to a printer, a 3D printer.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:21.520]   That's right. Yeah, that's called print craft. That is pretty awesome.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:25.280]   Yep. That's really cool. Yeah. That's really cool. Because it connects the physical thing,
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:30.880]   a lot of what we talk about in the maker space is in terms of education is it's great to learn
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:34.720]   the theory. Right. Right. But then what's the practical application? You always hear kids say,
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:38.480]   I'm never going to use this. Can I call this once I get out of school? Well, you know, show them how
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:42.720]   they use it, you know, and turn them on to education, turn them on to learning something new. Yeah.
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:48.000]   And they'll go a long way. So I really like this. And it's nice that if you do have a Raspberry Pi,
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.960]   it comes with by default, I believe, with the Raspberry and operating system. Yeah. So you just
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:58.640]   load up your your five dollar Raspberry Pi zero and plug in a few extra things. And it's right
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:02.400]   there. Kids can just jump on it and use it. Be better to get a Raspberry Pi 2 if you can afford
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:05.840]   the 35 bucks. Yeah, it'd be better. It'd be better. A little more horsepower and a little more memory.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:11.360]   But yeah, I mean, what a great thing that you have this little thing in an Altoids box. Right.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:16.960]   That is not only a Minecraft server that is persistent game, but you can program it.
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:22.800]   Exactly. Yep. Learn to program with something you love. Yeah, I love this. Jeff, some numbers.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:26.240]   Oh, all right. Let me try that.
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:36.640]   You surprised me. Oh, I'm sorry. No, no, I get up there. I'm there. Where was it? Right. Facebook
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:44.960]   is telling advertisers to add captions to their videos. People are watching 100 million hours of
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:54.000]   video on Facebook every day. Wow. Watching 100 million watching watching. Right. And so the
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:58.800]   advertising there, they haven't been as smart as AJ plus, for example, and they're not there.
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:02.240]   They're presuming people are going to listen to their wonderful ad. So they're not getting their
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:07.680]   message across. So Facebook's director of ad products marketing, Graham Mudd, told Business Insider,
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:13.440]   the company estimates that as many as 40% of video ads don't communicate their message effectively
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.920]   unless they have the sound on. So they're taking their just plain old commercials
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:22.240]   about campaign. Not being aware, of course, captions, headlines, other things.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:29.600]   Facebook also said that internal tests showed that captions can increase video view time
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:34.000]   by an average of 12%, which stands to reason, surprised not even more, in a sense.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:41.920]   Mudd said that 55% of people who watch the first three seconds of an ad will watch the next 10 seconds.
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:47.680]   45% will make it to the end. That three second number is significant. It's the length of time
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:54.640]   Facebook considers accounts as a view. So Facebook's going to charge you, I would presume, for that.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:05:00.800]   So it's interesting to me just simply that these guys are not updating for the way that, I mean,
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:05.360]   Facebook set the structure. And we talked about this in show before. I've argued for a few years
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:09.280]   that mobile video needed to be silent movies because you're working to put headset center and
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:14.000]   listen publicly or all that. I never anticipated what Facebook did in making auto play silent.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.560]   Thank God they did that. Well, they had to. And I find it actually a very good feature.
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:24.320]   As I look at the video and I will often, AJ+, I'll often sit and watch the whole thing. I get
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:28.160]   informed there's eye candy, things moving. It's great. You think advertisers would have been
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:32.080]   ahead on this and they're not. So now Facebook is trying to school them.
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:38.480]   I find it telling that I've actually used this as a shorthand way of judging
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:45.200]   which presidential candidates are socially media aware and which are not. Because for instance,
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:51.680]   Hillary is in fact your son is on the right team. Hillary does captions, you see, on all of her stuff
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:57.760]   so that you know immediately what's going on. And obviously that's going to raise her engagement.
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:02.720]   Let's see if Donald Trump, by the way, I follow them all because you don't need to know what he
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:13.040]   does. Let's see if he's using video to know. And are you using video? It barely has no video.
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:17.440]   Forget the captions. Now that's certainly not an indicator of whether somebody's going to be a
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:24.560]   good president. But I think it is interesting to see their command of the medium. Whether they're
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:30.640]   in the in this century field burn. Yeah. Well, let's see. I also follow the burn.
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:34.320]   Let's see if the burn has it. You know, he's what 70.
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:44.720]   Really good crack that was it John Kasich said. Somebody maybe. Oh yeah, he's using.
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:50.400]   Applause. Yeah, he's using captions. The burns got it.
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:55.200]   Because he's got to let young people. He's hip. Was it that was it Donald Trump said,
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:58.240]   I thought I thought Bernie is going to turn 77 right there on the stage.
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:06.960]   Very effective shot. All right. So the burn is doing it. Let's see maybe
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:12.800]   who's is Marco Rubio still in the running? No, I don't know. It just says the same thing over
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:19.040]   and over and over again. That's all. It's a lot easier to do the captions on his page.
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:25.120]   Yeah. Yeah. Did you see the Ted Cruz video, by the way, but see he's got the video.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:30.240]   Right. It's got the ad, which is a great ad. Captions Ted. Just a tip. I didn't see that one.
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:37.360]   Oh my God. He's finally taken name at the dot. Oh, I don't want to turn it go political on this,
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:41.440]   but I'll let you. But you're I think you're absolutely right. That's how you get the views up.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:47.120]   Yeah. Yeah. Facebook. This thing also says that Facebook conducted the study with Nielsen
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:53.040]   commissioned by Facebook that found that 40% up to 47% of the value in a video campaign
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:56.640]   was delivered in the first three seconds. Well, of course, Facebook would say that given that
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:02.560]   that's that's all they can view and 74% of the value was delivered in the first 10 seconds.
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:08.240]   Wow. I understand that. That's hard to do a video that 10s has 10 seconds.
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:13.200]   And you got to get the content in there in 10 seconds. Well, we could learn a thing or two
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:17.760]   from that value. How do you how do you say what the value of video is? Right. Yes. That's right.
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:22.320]   Let's reduce all Twitch shows 10 seconds. Snapchat. Good bird.
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:29.440]   Snap to it. I take great pride of the fact that we are a pretty old-fashioned here to it. We do long,
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:36.240]   thoughtful, wordy shows. So is Facebook gonna offer a you know, they should offer this as a
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:40.880]   service, right? Yeah, captioning. Yeah. Hey, we'll go back and redo all your videos for a fee
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:45.920]   and add the captions and then just you know, they must have some predictive.
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:51.280]   Push. No captions. Here's your, you know, he's given his, his thank you to New Hampshire speech,
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:57.360]   but am I going to turn on the sound now? Because I don't comment work, right? I can't. And you want
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:03.520]   to fall asleep on the job? No, come on now. Come on now. Let's not be mean. He's a nice fella.
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:07.280]   What would Trump call him? Low energy.
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:15.840]   How about Marco Rubio? Do you think he, as you said, probably very easy to caption his
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:25.600]   just have a robot do it. Yeah. No video. No video. Very sexy. Now, on the other hand,
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:28.880]   you might say, well, I think somebody who puts a lot of thought in there and a lot of text,
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:32.640]   what's wrong with that? You know, that's somebody who's not hip. I don't want somebody
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:38.640]   hip in the presidency. You want to communicate with voters? If I'm going to that page, use every
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:43.280]   tools available to communicate with me. Right. You can read text while you're on a treadmill.
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:50.640]   Yeah. Yeah. That's why you want a video. So Carl, Carl for Arena and Chris,
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:58.160]   my dear governor, Chris Christie are out. Oh, Chris did decide to drop out. Yeah, I did.
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:03.680]   The disrespect, yes. I'm sad about that because he was fun to watch. And you know,
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:08.880]   he's the guy who got Marco Rubio in a loop. As somebody said, I don't know where it was,
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:18.000]   but it was a murder suicide. It's terrible. I just tweeted that somebody should wake up Ben
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:25.200]   Carson and tell him he died last night. Yeah. But he's going on. Did you see the funny video of them
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:34.240]   coming on stage during the last debate? Did you see the remake? No. Oh, yeah. I saw it on your feed
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:38.000]   where you put John Travolta. I didn't put it there. I didn't put it there. Somebody put John
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.880]   Travolta on that John Travolta meme waiting to go on stage. It was perfect. Just perfect.
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:47.680]   I love the internet. Such a good meme where it's from a pulp fiction where Travolta comes over to
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:53.600]   the house and he's looking around. Where is she? She's talking to me. I know she's talking to me.
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:11:00.000]   All right. Let's see what you build here, my friend. All right. So, you know, I always try to
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.880]   bring a project on because I think that's people need to do want to show that video. I could
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:08.720]   show that video. Yeah. So look at him. I'm connected in. All right. Awesome.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:15.040]   There's your own simple RGB LED cube. Yes. I can't claim all the credit for this. The inspiration
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:19.600]   for this project came from a guy that I like to watch on YouTube. He does a channel called Great
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:25.280]   Scott and he's from Europe and he's got a thick accent, but it's okay. He does some cool stuff.
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:30.400]   And so I've always wanted to do a five by five LED or an LED cube and he released a video on how
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:34.640]   to do, you know, build your own five by five LED cube. I thought, you know what? I'm going to take a
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:40.320]   look at what he did and follow along and you did it. You did it. You made a great one. So,
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:44.800]   what do you need? You need LEDs? You need LEDs and these are programmable LEDs. There's a big
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:48.320]   difference. So these aren't just regular LEDs. They're not just multicolor LEDs. They actually
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:53.760]   have a little chip inside and it sends what it does is it reads there's an in and out on each one
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:58.720]   of these. There's four connections, two for power and then two for the data path. So, what it does is
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:03.520]   it looks for a data stream and it says, is this a little bit of information for me if not pass it on?
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:10.880]   And so it gets its instructions from a single wire. You send the command down the wire and it
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:15.280]   says, okay, this is for me. You just told me to make myself red. I'm going to make myself red.
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:20.240]   You just told me to turn on. I'm going to turn it on. And so they're really great because all
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:25.040]   you need is one wire out of an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi to make this whole thing function.
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:30.080]   Really? You don't need to do shift registers. You don't need to do complicated electronic
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:33.840]   setups and that makes it really, really good. So you dress them by row and column kind of?
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:38.320]   You can do that, absolutely. You can. Right now there's zero through, I have 125. So they're
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:43.840]   numbered zero through 124. And that's how you do it. But actually we're looking at doing an array
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:48.960]   like that, an X-Y-Z. And that way you can do some really cool stuff very easily. So should I turn
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:53.840]   it on? Yeah. So we can take a look at it. You've actually put in a pot so you can dim them, which
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:57.600]   is not because they're on dim mode so the cameras can pick up. Oh, look at that. So this is one I
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:02.400]   made. I made this pattern just as a test to see if I could do it. It's always fun. And then the next
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:06.160]   one I did is more interesting, which is it was raining at the time here in California, which is
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:11.680]   odd. But I wanted to do a thunder and lightning, a lightning and rain kind of thing. So you'll see
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:16.560]   in a minute the lightning will go, right? And then it'll start raining. And this is you written in
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:23.680]   light. Oh, that's cool. And C or? C++. This is done with Arduino. So it's C++.
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:28.080]   Arduino. It's not a Raspberry Pi. Yeah. It's a Arduino Nano. If I open it up, you'd be surprised.
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:34.080]   The thing measures about an inch by about half an inch. A lot of loops. A lot of
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:39.520]   loops. A lot of four loops here. Exactly. That's exactly right. A lot of math goes into this,
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:45.200]   basically. So now it's pouring outside, right? Oh, it's so cool. It's so cool. It's a lot of fun.
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:48.240]   It's a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun. Tell you what, if you want to learn how to solder.
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:53.520]   Yeah, that's a lot of soldering. Practice first. Do a simple project and then come back
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:57.360]   to this. This took me about 20 hours of soldering to put together.
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:00.880]   Because the LEDs have a short little leads that you're putting on copper wire there.
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:06.400]   That's right. That's right. Yep. Yep. And there's a lot of soldering. There's four solder
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:13.440]   joints for every LED. Wow. You look at these people that do the 10 by 10 cubes or even larger.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:18.000]   And it's like that must have taken you a year, right? Because it's exponentially larger
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:24.880]   when you take a look at that. So anyway, it's a lot of fun. It's electronically and
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:30.560]   programmatically. It's a fairly simple project to do. But it's a great little project and, you know,
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:34.800]   it's a nice showy project. If you want something to impress your friends, an LED cube is the way to
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:40.400]   go. And Core Health says, "That's nice, but what is it? Was it good for? It's not good for anything."
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:44.480]   Yeah, it's just for fun. It's just for fun. Although you could tie it to music, right?
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:47.760]   Absolutely. That's the next step. There's a couple things I want to do with this.
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:51.760]   One is to add a speaker so that when you see that flash of lightning, you get the thunder
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:58.320]   with it, right? The other one is I've got a little chip that does a wavelength analysis.
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:02.160]   So you need a microphone? So you can need a microphone and this little chip. And it'll take
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:07.760]   the audio in and then turn it into a wave pattern. I'm going to build this in Minecraft.
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:13.280]   There you go. Not any snow soldering required. That's right. That'd be cool, actually.
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:17.520]   You could totally do it. Yeah, totally. In the back of this book, it has a table of
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:24.960]   all the different materials. So I could alternate gold blocks with a redstone or a flowing lava.
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:29.040]   Yeah. That'd be kind of interesting. Yeah. Use the beacon feature. Yeah. Do beacons.
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:37.600]   Yeah. Some people are software. Some people are hardware. Yeah. Yeah. You could be both.
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:39.440]   I think you should be both. I think people should be both.
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:53.680]   Submarine. I think we're going to dive. You could make this if you had a lot of time,
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:16:00.560]   you could make a burning man 1000 by 1000 that you ride around in in a bicycle.
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:05.520]   That would be crazy. That would be crazy. The other thing that someone actually I thought of
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:12.160]   is to do the snake game. Yeah. You know, where you chase the red pixel around and it gets bigger
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:15.680]   and bigger and bigger until the whole thing is lit. That'd be fun.
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:22.240]   Haven't had time to work that out. Once I get the matrix written, right, for the XYZ matrix,
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:27.280]   I wish there were more time in life. Me too. If I didn't have to sleep, I could do things like
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:34.320]   this. Yeah. Damn that sleep. Yeah. Aaron, so glad you came. You always bring a project that's fun.
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:38.880]   Yeah, I tried to. Really cool. I can't believe you do. Yeah. And you do a lot of these things
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:43.280]   with your kids. I mean, are they kind of yeah, my daughter. In fact, you know, Jeff was talking
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:48.640]   about the three doodler. She's been wanting a three doodler. Oh, so you're not going to use it.
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:55.200]   There's a lot of fun. My little pony. My problem is I have the first version. Yeah, the new version
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.600]   is way better. Oh, yeah. They did a lot of really nice improvements to it. And it's really good.
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:02.960]   Yeah, great bunch of people. Yeah, we've got the beta version in the makerspace actually,
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:06.160]   and she doesn't want to use that one. She wants the new one. Yeah. Yeah. Oh,
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:10.640]   maybe a good right. Good birthday gift or maybe you will get one for the makerspace to share.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:15.520]   Where's the makerspace? It's in Benesha. So if you're in the anywhere in really in the
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:20.240]   Northern California, just north of San Francisco, if you're in Oakland or Concord, Walnut Creek,
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:24.880]   Petaluma even. Yeah. We've got people that come from Napa and American Canyon down to Benesha.
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:30.960]   And you get shared tools. You get free training on a lot of stuff. It's really, really inexpensive.
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:36.400]   And we're doing Benesha Makerspace.org. And then we're doing a maker fair in Benesha. It's our
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:41.040]   second maker fair. Congratulations. And yeah, last year's was really successful. So that's going to be
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:45.280]   in April, April 16th is a Benesha maker fair. So if you're in the area and you want to come down
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:48.480]   and check out what people are doing, that's the best time to do it. And we're looking for
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:53.600]   some speakers. We'd like to have a featured speaker. So maybe you guys can help me crowdsource
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:57.360]   that. Who should I get for a speaker? Who would be a good public speaker who would come up and
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:03.680]   talk about the value of making things and inventing things? I shall keep my eyes out.
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:07.280]   Yeah, let me know. Yeah. I bet I could find you somebody. That'd be great. Yeah.
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:10.880]   Thank you so much for joining us. Jeff Jarvis, always a pleasure.
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:16.560]   Jeff is a journalism professor at CUNY, but you could find his blog at buzzmachine.com. Follow
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:22.240]   on the Twitter at Jeff Jarvis. Do you still use Google plus? Really? Not really. No. It's sad.
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:25.200]   I don't use it as much anymore either. I still use it just not as much.
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:31.040]   When I go in there now, it feels like it's like a lot of spam. Well, here's the big news. Yeah.
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:36.560]   Mike Elgin, the greatest defender of Google plus, the man who said no spams there,
[02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:43.360]   complained the other day. Spam on Google plus. Just spam. So sad. Spam. So sad.
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:48.160]   And I think Google's not doing it as service with their hot topics because I'm seeing a lot of
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:56.560]   stuff that should not be up and coming. So it's disappointing. Hey, look at this. Jason Howell,
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:01.520]   how I use Android? Ooh. From Computer World. I'll have to see that.
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:06.080]   Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Aaron. Thanks to all of you for joining us. We do this. We can Google
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:13.040]   every Wednesday afternoon, about 1.30 p.m. Pacific for 30 Eastern, 21.30 UTC. You can watch live
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:20.240]   on twit.tv or get on demand audio and video after the fact, twit.tv/twig. We're also on YouTube.
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:25.280]   We're also everywhere, frankly, on every podcast client. Make sure you get a copy each and every
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:30.720]   week. And we'll see you next time on Twig. Bye-bye.
