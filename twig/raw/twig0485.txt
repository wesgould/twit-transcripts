[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Up next on this week in Google I'm Jason Hell filling in for Leo and we've got a jam
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.120]   pack show lots of news to talk about the end of Hangouts.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.480]   You may feel like you've heard this once before.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.920]   Well apparently it's imminent.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.960]   Also the end of Aloe is right around the corner.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.040]   Facebook emails have been leaked by the EU and we know a little bit more about what
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.480]   Facebook has done on the back end to kind of cover its trail a little bit.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.600]   Snapdragon 855 was announced.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.960]   Waymo 1.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960]   Project Dragonfly and the problems that's creating for Google at this point.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960]   A whole lot to talk about this week in Google is next.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.960]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.960]   From people you trust.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.960]   This is Twig.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.960]   This is Twig.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.960]   This week in Google, episode 485 recorded on Wednesday December 5th, 2018.

[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   That stands for this week in and Google.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   I'm Jason Halifilling in for Leo Leo is out.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   I think he gets back this weekend.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   At least I hope so because I'm doing new screensavers with him.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   So I'm going to bank on that.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   And I always enjoy when he's gone because I get to hop into this show.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   I love this week in Google.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   So thanks for letting me kind of take it over.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   Joining us today, of course, Stacey Higginbotham, creator of the IoT podcast and Internet of Things newsletter.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960]   How you doing Stacey?
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   So great.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.960]   Thanks.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   Fantastic.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   It's good to have you here.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   Good to see you.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.960]   So we don't have Jeff quite yet.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.960]   Apparently he's in France and maybe he will fly in at some point.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   If so, we'll make room on the set, of course, for him.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.960]   But in his absence, we have Kevin Tofol coming back about Chromebooks.com and also the IoT podcast along with Stacey.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   How's it going, KT?
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   You're silly America.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   It's going well.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   I'm probably not as happy as Stacey is right now and we'll find out a little later.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.960]   But I'm in a good mood.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   Oh boy, that's quite a setup.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   I want to ask like right now, but do we have to wait until later?
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   I don't know.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   It's not my thing of the week.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   So, okay, if you want to...
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   Okay.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.960]   Cool.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   Is that what we call it?
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   The thing of the week?
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   No.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.960]   Those things and items and whatever it is that we call them.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.960]   Why don't we start the show with something good?
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.960]   Why don't we start the show with something that Stacey is excited about?
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   What are you excited about?
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   Oh, this is the moment for the gin calendar, right?
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   Not the old stuff.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   I think so.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   I think so.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.760]   Is that your thing of the week?
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.960]   Is your thing of the week the gin calendar?
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.960]   That was my thing of the week last week.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   Oh, I see.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   Okay.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.160]   And so what happened is Kevin Tofol apparently decided that I was worthy of owning one of
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.960]   these and he ordered one for me as a Christmas present, which is really nice.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   Thanks, Kevin.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.640]   So, I'm having my first gin and tonic made with one of my brand new gins.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.760]   It's from Italy.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   And it is quite delicious.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   Hey, this totally works.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.960]   Chicken head in the chat twig this week in gin.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   It works.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.960]   This week.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.040]   I don't know if that was coined last week, but it works for this week too.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.640]   I don't think so, which is really astonishing.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.240]   So this is, yeah, I will not drink too many of these, but I did want to partake and enjoy.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.600]   I think that you should drink too many of those.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   It's an advent calendar.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.800]   You got to at least drink one a day, right?
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   This is my daughter's argument.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.760]   She's like, I eat the chocolate right away when I open my advent calendar.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   You've got four unopened bottles, Mom.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.680]   I'm like, I got some catching up to do.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   When did she get a break?
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   Yeah, I know.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.680]   When did that end start?
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.920]   It starts the first.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.440]   An advent calendar counts down one to 24 days till Christmas Eve.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.760]   Today is the fifth.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.720]   So you should go through five on the show and get caught up.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   Good God.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.720]   That's five ounces of alcohol.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.920]   I mean, let's see how we could break this up.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.400]   If you finish a bottle before the first ad, then a bottle before the second ad, then
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.200]   a bottle before the third ad, and then a bottle with your thing at the end of the show.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.520]   I mean, that's four bottles.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   You're close at that point.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.520]   Okay.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   You're a shot right now.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.440]   That way you can't get shot.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.920]   I hate to make it.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   And I swear this entire episode might make the best of in that case.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   There we go.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   Well, I don't want to be a...
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.080]   I'll definitely hit one if I hit two.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.600]   We'll be okay.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.040]   That's not crazy amounts of alcohol.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.400]   I can still talk intelligently about some things, not all things.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.680]   Yeah, she does two or three on the IoT podcast, and she's fine every week.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.680]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.040]   And that's it like eight in the morning.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.040]   So...
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.120]   That's the eight in the morning everyone knows is the best time for gin.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120]   Exactly.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   We all know this.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.560]   That's how I start my day.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.040]   What do we want to start with that doesn't involve alcohol?
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.280]   It's about what's happening with the communications platforms that we have long mocked Google
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.280]   for because...
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.280]   Oh boy.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.280]   Yes.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.440]   I feel like I should be where I am wearing black, but what's happening there?
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.600]   What is going on with Hangouts?
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.440]   Well, apparently 95 Google has sources that say Hangouts is going to reach its end of life
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.440]   in 2020.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.640]   I feel like the writing has been on the wall here with Hangouts, and then we'll talk about
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   it.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   I'll go in a second.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.800]   The writing is really on the wall with Aloe.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.200]   But they made the shift away from Hangouts as a consumer product towards it being an enterprise
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   product.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.240]   Hangouts chat and Hangouts meet are only available if you're a G Suite subscriber.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.120]   But 95 Google posted this article to say, "Well, the consumer version of Hangouts is
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.360]   going away."
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.120]   Then somebody on the team from Google said, "Wow, your sources are really off the mark."
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.000]   Scott Johnson, there we go, from Google says, "Your sources are off the mark that the consumer
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.360]   Hangouts will at some point be upgraded to Hangouts chat and Hangouts meet."
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   I don't know.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.520]   As usual with Google messaging, I'm completely confused when news or leaks happen.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.960]   You just never actually know what the deal is.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.400]   So Hangouts chat is just chat and Hangouts meet is the audio and video?
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   What help?
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   Exactly.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   Exactly.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   Yes.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.120]   So Stacey, you have a G Suite account.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.120]   I do not.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.720]   And you and I use Hangouts all the time.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.720]   We won't never talk again.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720]   Nope.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.720]   No, we won't.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.560]   Not on regular Hangouts because once we get migrated, or until we get migrated, I should
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.240]   say if Hangouts is shut down, I don't think they'll do that where consumers don't have
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.640]   an option.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.880]   You would have to invite me to a video chat, for example, because I'm outside of your
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   G Suite domain.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.280]   You say what?
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.120]   You would use Hangouts meet for video or Hangouts chat to chat.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.120]   Oh, OK.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.720]   So I would still use it and invite you.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.080]   But it would no longer be this wonderfully convenient I am kind of function on the side
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   of my Gmail.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   Correct.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.160]   It would no longer be this wide open I am, which is really how it's been since day one
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.120]   or since the product before it, however you want to look at it.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.200]   And what Google-- it's ironic that we're talking about messaging apps and it's really
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.400]   Google's messaging that's really the issue here.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.680]   It's branding, it's messaging, it's PR.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.640]   They have to tell a story here and they're not telling it.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.000]   They're letting the story be told for them.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.600]   And that's not the way you want to do things.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.960]   Meet an aloe or aloe and duo.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.680]   I mean, that was going to replace things.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.600]   That sort of didn't happen.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.480]   Is duo-- I don't know what it's going to happen to duo because why would you have a
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.960]   duplicate of Hangouts meet and duo?
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:29.320]   But they did, Jason, as you said, start devoting resources away from consumer towards enterprise.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.880]   And I mean, a lot of enterprises that comes with their G Suite.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.520]   A lot of enterprises actually do use that as their G Suite shop.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.560]   That's pretty much the thing to use.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.200]   But it just wasn't clear on what was happening with the consumer side.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.160]   It wasn't clear from the time they put aloe and duo out there a year and a half, two and
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.280]   a half years ago, whatever it was.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.960]   No, and obviously it's continued to be confusing today.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.480]   A nine to five Google post from a reliable source there says that aloe is going to be
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.280]   shut down quote soon, although they say it's probably at least somewhat delayed because
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.840]   of this Hangouts story that published that we started talking about.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.680]   The last aloe update happened back in January.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:17.880]   That was about the time that the aloe lead, Emmet fully, left for Facebook.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.800]   And then if you remember, aloe's team was entirely diverted over to Android messages
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.040]   to kind of lead up that team, which there at that point are kind of like, OK, well, aloe's
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.440]   days are definitely numbered.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   It's so confusing.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.640]   There's so much movement.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.880]   There's so many name changes.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.880]   There's so many.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.360]   Well, let's stop, you know, stop making our product for consumers and now it's for business.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.280]   And now it's back to consumers again.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.920]   No wonder nobody knows what's going on.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   It's just so confusing.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:51.080]   So right now, then should I, I'm not going to worry about this until like right before
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.080]   it's unsaids.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.960]   But I am going to keep my eyes open because then what kind of messaging and I am service,
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.520]   do I use to talk to the world?
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.120]   I can't use Facebook Messenger because I don't use Facebook.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.120]   Right.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.040]   That's a good question.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.960]   I mean, I mean, I think I think Google would love for Android messages at some point.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.960]   It is still called Android messages, right?
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   There's messages.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   Where's the Google messages?
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   That's texting.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.920]   I don't want I need a differentiation between texting and voicemail.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   And voicemail.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   Sorry, not voice.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.960]   Sorry, texting in like I am chat.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   Sorry.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.520]   I think the idea behind Android messages was that it was going to get the RCS functionality
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.040]   built into it, which would bring it closer to being a more unified product of ES SMS,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.840]   but also kind of the chat features that you get in a messaging app.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.960]   I don't know, you know, but you might you might want those siloed between two different
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.080]   places entirely, you know, I do because my friends text me and I like to ignore it, but
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.920]   I need my my messaging needs to be immediate.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.000]   And those aren't my friends.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.600]   Those are my work people who might also be my friends.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   Yeah, I was going to say it.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   Hold on.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   It's like evil woman.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.800]   Give me that shit about me, huh?
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.480]   Yeah, I this all ties into as you're saying, the RCS chat and we're going to discuss that
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:17.160]   in a second, but I would just wonder, see, part of the issue is Android messages is an
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   Android app.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:24.240]   It's not like you're going to have that on an iPhone, whereas you have a message and
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.000]   you know, on your iPhone.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.680]   So are they going to make that work together?
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.760]   I don't know.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.080]   Google wants an open platform, I think, for chat and it's hard to do when you've got iOS
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.160]   and iMessage.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.240]   So I thought Hangouts was that because I use Hangouts on my iPhone all the time.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.960]   These are my Apple watch talk to Stacy when I walk in the dog.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.400]   I mean, I don't I don't know.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.120]   I think they're just trying to figure out what to do.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.480]   And a lot of these I am clients have been bought up.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.320]   You know, we chat is what with Facebook now, right?
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.800]   Is we chat with Facebook or is it a, oh, what's that?
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   It's what's app.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   There we go.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   There's too many of these.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   That's the top.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   There are.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.960]   And they're all like combinations of the same words, but in different orders and stuff.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.080]   Yeah, no, it's it's true.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.680]   It's confusing at this point.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:19.800]   Even when Google Google Google Google came out with Aloe, it still felt like Google was
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.440]   behind like it had already missed that opportunity.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.600]   And the fact that Aloe is being shuttered after not very long of existing and after
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.440]   Google totally built it up in the beginning proves that it was just really late to the
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.840]   game with Aloe and it should have, you know, moved on that type of a product before or
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.680]   or that Hangouts was the solution all along and for whatever reason they decided to bail
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.200]   and change their strategy.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.600]   And that's really unfortunate because I feel like at a certain point, all they really needed
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   to do was really cultivate that SMS functionality within Hangouts and kind of clarify it a
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.400]   little bit.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   And that would have been the great option that would have been the perfect service people
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.360]   were using it already.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.600]   But that's just not how Google does things.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.280]   Well, I could tell you a little bit about how Google does things.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.800]   And I think two of these come into play here.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.280]   One is that over the past couple of years, Google has made a really big push to get into
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.720]   enterprise and therefore differentiate some of its products between enterprise and consumer.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.440]   So that's why we have Hangouts and Hangouts Meet, for example.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.200]   And finally, I can't stress this enough.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.640]   Google is such a data-driven company that it, I don't want to say it doesn't matter if
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.840]   consumers or people like a certain product that Google doesn't care that they like it.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.160]   But if the data shows that they're not getting, you know, their 10x or 100x efficiency return
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.240]   or whatever it may be or engagement, et cetera, they don't keep it around.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.600]   That's how they look at everything.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   It's all data-driven.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.920]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.720]   Can you mention Duo as far as like who knows what's going to happen with Duo?
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.000]   Strangely, I think Duo is one of the things that seems to be working okay.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.720]   You know, Duo ends up pre-installed on phones.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.000]   I think it's getting regular updates.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.760]   I think I just saw in the chat room a new update today that's around improving faster video
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.200]   messaging using Duo.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.840]   But I don't know how that interplays with a video solution on, you know, Hangouts chat
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.760]   or I guess it would be Meet.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   I don't know.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.760]   It's super cool.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.400]   I still only have, let's see, I have six contacts in Duo.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.400]   Three of them are people I forced to be on Duo to talk to me on Duo.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.640]   You are not sold on the Duo strategy.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.280]   Well, no, I'm just like, and one of them is Kevin.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.160]   That makes sense.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:43.040]   I can see, I actually, no, I still, out of all of my contacts, there's only a few that
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.560]   are actually on Duo.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.280]   Oh, Jerry W at Twit is on Duo.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.280]   Oh, Jerry W.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   Jerry.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.280]   Hey, Jerry.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.280]   I have never used Duo.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.640]   Oh, aren't we using Duo to connect with you in France right now?
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.280]   Isn't Duo powering our French connection?
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.760]   No, I'm using Skype from Chrome.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.640]   Of course you are.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.440]   Jeff Jarvis, Buzz machine.com.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.600]   How you doing?
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.760]   Jeff, it's great to see you.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   All right.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.760]   That's how this works.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   So far so good.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.200]   Jeff, you need to grab a bottle of Vino because this is a beverage heavy twig.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.960]   Well, I already had mine late here.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.560]   Well, we all have a beverage.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.720]   It's just 50% of us have water and the other 50 are getting drunk.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.120]   Just utterly trashed, trashed on twig.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.120]   No.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   Okay.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   All right.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.120]   Okay.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.120]   Well, it's good to have you here, Jeff.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:41.840]   We did not talk about the slate without you because I'm sure that you are interested in
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.000]   the Google Pixel slate.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.800]   We might as well do that now because I just said the words out loud.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   What do you think?
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.040]   First of all, before we kind of talk about, you know, Kevin's had his time with the Pixel
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   slate.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.600]   I've had a good amount of time with my Pixel slate.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:01.840]   I'm always curious to know, Jeff, where you stand on Google's solutions for its Chrome OS,
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.680]   you know, tablets and laptops and everything.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.480]   What do you think?
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.080]   So just now I was trying to get on and I had to reboot because the Android app insisted
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   on answering.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.400]   It wouldn't let go and we know that it's inferior and I had to get to the Skype on the browser,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.240]   which isn't perfect either.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.880]   But so I had to reboot.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.880]   So what's the problem there?
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:33.040]   The problem is that Android apps on Chrome are still inadequate.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.800]   Thus, the app world on Chrome is still inadequate.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.720]   I love my Pixelbook as does Kevin like his.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.160]   For God's sakes, he devoted a blog and a purpose career to it.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:52.640]   It's a lesson, but I'm not ready to say that Chrome is the OS for all yet.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:17:01.960]   And as a tablet goes, I think Android is still a better OS for a tablet than Chrome is.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.880]   Android is better as a tablet OS than Chrome OS is as a tablet OS.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.440]   Neither are amazing in tablet form.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440]   It's a low bar.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.880]   But if you had to choose between the two and I might, I would actually probably agree with
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.760]   that even though I thought that I would carry the other side of it because in my time with
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:28.320]   the Pixel Slate in the like there just isn't a whole lot of points in my life where I really
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.840]   want to work in a productivity environment with a tablet, but I've kind of forced myself
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.200]   to with the Pixel Slate and all it's done has been full of headaches.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:46.120]   It's just weird little hiccups trying to be productive on the Pixel Slate in tablet mode,
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.000]   working within like Google Docs and everything like that.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.040]   I appreciate that Google has made the updates.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:58.320]   I hear it is with an overhead shot that they've made the updates to Chrome OS to better appeal
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.720]   to tablet form factors.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.200]   But I don't know if it's going to snap out or is it feel the magnet behind?
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.600]   There we go.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.920]   So I mean it's set up a little bit nicer for a touch environment, but there's just weird
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.920]   stuff like I've had, I've been trying to multitask and do like the split screen thing.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.840]   So I'd have one app on this side, one app on this side and I'd tap onto one side to
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.000]   edit into the field and then on screen keyboard would come on and throw everything out of
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.840]   order and you can minimize it down into a small keyboard on the side.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.240]   But there was just no fluidity, no seamlessness about it.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.320]   I'd tap over here to type and it would still be caught over on this window and then I'd
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.840]   have to go over here and find out where I typed over there because even though I typed
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.040]   over here to put focus on this side, it still didn't register.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   And just weird things like that that on a productivity device that's going to slow you
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.680]   down and you're only going to deal with that so many times before you completely give up.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.280]   And that's how I feel about the tablet form factor on the Pixelbook Slate.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.760]   So let me ask a question here.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.160]   Actually I'll make an agreement with Jeff.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.960]   There's definitely work to be done on Android apps in Chrome OS.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.480]   That's not unique to the Pixel Slate because the Pixel Slate runs the same software as
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.480]   every other Chromebook.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.080]   It's actually one version ahead right now but the rest will catch up next week.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.040]   So any Android app issues you have on the Slate, you're going to have elsewhere as
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.040]   well.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.040]   It's just no different.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.800]   However, I guess I've been using this full time for productivity.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   I spent six hours yesterday coding on it, writing some blog posts, doing my normal stuff.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.080]   And I was very productive which is not what you just said you were, Jason.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.520]   Did you do it in a tablet environment or did you do it with a touch keyboard?
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.000]   That's the point I'm bringing up.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.680]   So I'm kind of being funny here.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.840]   Don't take this wrong way.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   You're using it wrong.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.120]   Yeah, no, no, I would agree.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.320]   I would absolutely agree.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.320]   Yes, continue.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.440]   I don't really mean it that way.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:04.200]   So my point is to be productive on most any device, you probably need a hardware keyboard.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:09.360]   To try and split screen and use an on-screen keyboard and expect the same productivity
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:16.640]   that you would get from a laptop or desktop, I don't find that to be a feasible expectation.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.840]   So yes, I have the keyboard attached.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   It's actually on my lap.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.800]   It was on my lap for six hours yesterday.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.480]   I was in a recliner.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.040]   Yes, the keyboard does wobble or the slate wobbles when you type.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.320]   I'm kind of used to it by now.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.760]   A lot of people wrote it off after one day and I get that.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.120]   That's a very personal choice keyboard.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.000]   But I would never try and be productive with this without the keyboard for any length of
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.120]   time I guess I should say.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.880]   And when I don't want to be productive, that's when I'm going to watch my YouTube TV and
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.080]   just cruise the web and chill out and whatnot.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   That's when I take the keyboard off and I'm just in my leanback mode with my tablet.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.240]   Man, I never have leanback modes with my tablet anymore.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   That's my problem.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.680]   Yeah, when I'm in leanback mode, I'm like, "Screw my devices."
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.800]   Is there a jigsaw puzzle I can do?
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.720]   Yeah, I completely agree, Kevin.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.960]   And it's a fair point.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:13.120]   I think my exercise has been if Google has created a device that it sees, has created
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:19.600]   a device around its updates to Chrome OS to make it more friendly in both a docked environment
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.240]   and a touch screen environment.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.840]   How far could I push that?
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.280]   And could I be productive if I didn't have that keyboard?
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.680]   I would say that in that regard, I probably am using it wrong.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.000]   There's probably better uses for just the tablet mode.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.360]   In that case, it's probably fine.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.720]   Like you said though, you are going to run into these issues with Android apps, which
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.480]   is, I would say, a large part of what you might want to do with it in tablet mode is,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.480]   "Oh, well, I'll run a tablet app and play some games and whatever."
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.520]   And there are going to be weird little issues that pop up here and there.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:55.120]   It's probably more on that kind of strange, kind of sandwiching of Android app compatibility
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.000]   into Chrome OS.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.040]   Sometimes I love that as a feature and I love that they are capable of doing that.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:08.880]   But sometimes I just, I desire more streamlined something with it.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:15.720]   And at least Chrome OS in a keyboard environment feels familiar to me from the Pixelbook.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.000]   And I can move fast on a Pixelbook and I'll be honest, like the Pixel site keyboard, when
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.920]   I first started using it, I didn't care for it.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.320]   It's really grown on me.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:32.520]   I think my only complaint for it is that it does have this kind of deep, deepness to it
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.760]   that if you're really using it on your lap as a laptop, it can be a little awkward.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   Thankfully, I'm 6'8", so I have really long legs, so it works for me.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.080]   I could see how it would not work for most people because it's just super deep as far
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.680]   as that's concerned and a little wobbly when you're in that situation.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.480]   So possibly for me, maybe that bridge, have you checked out the bridge keyboard option?
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.120]   Is it out yet?
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.640]   I think it is.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.280]   It's out and it's $40 less than the Google option.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.680]   And it has less of a footprint because you're just sliding the tablet piece into the keyboard
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.680]   itself.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.840]   There's nothing behind the keyboard at that point for a base.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.240]   It's more stable for sure.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.760]   I didn't find that typing experience or the trackpad experience quite as good.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.200]   I'm not saying it's bad, but also it's Bluetooth.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.200]   And Chrome OS has some Bluetooth issues.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.920]   Google's been working on a new Bluetooth stack for Chrome OS, so I didn't want to go that
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.680]   route even though I know it would have made for a better laptop.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.680]   But yeah, I mean, it's out.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.680]   It's nice.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.080]   I felt the same as you, Jason.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   I wasn't too crazy.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.480]   In fact, 10 minutes after my review unit got here, I was on email with my PR contract at
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   Google.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.680]   I'm like, what is up with this keyboard?
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.720]   Why is it wobbling, et cetera, et cetera?
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.320]   And, you know, I mean, they know what's done is done.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   It's been designed.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.120]   All I could do is make suggestions at this point.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.120]   So but it has grown on me.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.080]   And, you know, it's kind of like phones.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.520]   When I get a really big phone, bigger than what I used to have, I'm like, oh, this is
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.520]   terrible.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   And then I'm like, oh, this is awesome.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   I'm like, it's not so bad.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.400]   And then a week later, I'm like, what was I complaining about?
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.640]   This is awesome.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.040]   You know, it's not keeping me from being productive, I should say.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:22.680]   So I would tell people to give it a try if they're interested in a tablet and not everybody
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   needs a tablet.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.080]   That's a whole other aspect of this conversation, I think.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.600]   The key to me here is you're both right.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.520]   The problem is because you're right, Kevin.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.120]   This is exactly like my Chromebook Pixel.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.480]   The only thing is that I hardly ever think of it as a tablet except when you buy the slate,
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.560]   you're thinking of first as a tablet and that brings out all its weaknesses.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.560]   But it is the same.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.800]   The only time I use the Pixel as a tablet is I just did on the airplane coming here and
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.560]   flip it around to watch a movie or something.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.040]   Otherwise I am always in laptop mode and it is always a wonderful machine.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.120]   The only weakness is when I get on the plane and I want to watch Netflix or come here and
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.280]   use Skype.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.080]   But otherwise, yeah, it's great.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.520]   But when you have a tablet, every tablet we can speak, just be a war parent.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.320]   I don't disagree with what you said, but it's kind of funny.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.080]   I look at it completely the opposite.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.480]   I looked at it as I love my Pixelbook, but I'm not a fan of using that in tablet mode
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.920]   for my entertainment time because it's heavier and so on.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.880]   So I'm like, I can get the Pixelbook laptop experience here.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:30.680]   And then when I want the little leanback experience later, just a tablet, I just pull
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.560]   it off and go sit down somewhere and I'm good.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   I don't know.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.400]   Again, I'm looking at it differently because how many computers do you own or how many
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.720]   computers do you work on on a daily basis?
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.640]   I mean, because I think that's part of it.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.040]   If you have like a regular laptop, you have a tablet.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.680]   I don't know if you need a tablet, but if you have a regular laptop, would you use this?
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.800]   I was full time on the Pixelbook for about six or eight months.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.120]   Before that, I was full time on an iPad Pro for a year and a half.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.520]   And Jason, I didn't use that without a keyboard.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520]   I wouldn't even try.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.640]   It was the same discussion we had earlier.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.960]   I mean, I was productive, but with their keyboard.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.800]   The slate, I sold my Pixelbook already.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.920]   I shipped it two days ago.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.160]   I'm full time on the slate.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:29.880]   And it's a really fair point that as far as you using the iPad Pro with a keyboard 100%
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.440]   of the time, this is probably my first time using this type of a device, like this type
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.520]   of a convertible that pops out the tablet with any sort of regularity outside of just
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.920]   like, "Oh, that's interesting.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.240]   That's neat for 20 minutes or maybe a short amount of time."
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:49.520]   I've been living on this slate since I got it like a week and a half ago.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.600]   So it's my first time thinking in these terms.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:58.960]   And yeah, I feel like you've turned a light bulb in my head as far as that's concerned.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:05.240]   I wanted to hold it to a certain standard because it presents itself as a tablet, Chrome
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.160]   OS device.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.920]   And I want it to work so well in that mode for things so you don't always need the keyboard.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.800]   But the reality is it's just really hard to do that.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.760]   And you really see that when you're editing a Google Doc and you type into a cell and then
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:23.080]   suddenly the keyboard pops up, you've got this much viewable space above it and it's
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:28.840]   like it doesn't know where to put the contents of everything on the screen.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.960]   Everything becomes kind of jumpy and unexpected.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   So then that's a way to do it.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.360]   It's not the way to do it.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.520]   The way to do it would be to use some sort of an attachment like this keyboard.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.920]   But in that regard, I would say with the keyboard attachment, absolutely.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.320]   I'm just as productive as I would be with my Pixelbook that I've gotten very used to.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.800]   And I think when I first got this, probably like a day or two after getting this, I was
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.200]   like, oh man, I'm totally going to go back to the Pixelbook because I just don't know
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   if I can do this.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.680]   I'm happy that I continued working with it because I have come around to it.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680]   And you're right.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.360]   It's nice to be able to pop it out if I wanted to.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:12.440]   I haven't flown on any airplanes and needed to entertain myself by popping it out yet.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.640]   So apparently I need to take a trip.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.760]   No, you just need to take an office chair and stick another office chair about 17 inches
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.760]   in front of your office air and then try.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   That could do it because yes, exactly.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.600]   I wouldn't have any space to put this on the train in front of me on a plane if I wanted
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   to get work done.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   So there's the opposite problem.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.360]   So just take these questions, Jason.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.480]   Next week, Leo came back and said you're allowed one machine for everything.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.480]   Which one is it?
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.800]   Oh boy.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.840]   I think I general in general the past few years have tried to keep myself committed
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:52.120]   to whatever the latest Google released phone is and the Google released, you know, Pixel
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.880]   laptop, whatever incarnation.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:01.120]   So I probably picked this because I feel like I feel like personally I need to be along
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.480]   with Google at the front of their kind of philosophy, you know what I mean?
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.040]   And so I probably would pick this because in all reality, this whole environment is
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:17.520]   not making me less productive when I have it all docked and in this mode.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.840]   The length of it is annoying, but it's not a deal breaker for me.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.360]   Everything else I'm able to do just as good as anything else.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.360]   So that I use.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.920]   Are you going to buy the bridge keyboard?
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.000]   I don't know.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.720]   Because every review that I read about it makes it seem like it's a great solution if
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.280]   you want the form factor while it's docked to be more pixel book like.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:43.960]   But it's not very good if you have a high bar for the quality of the trackpad and the
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.960]   keyboard.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   Like you said, Kevin.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   Blue tooth problems.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.960]   What's that?
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.840]   And Bluetooth problems.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   And Bluetooth problems.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.840]   That's another big one.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.480]   So I don't know if that's worth it to me because I know for myself that one of the things
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.840]   that really annoys me about a lot of the pixel, the Chromebooks that I've tested over the
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.600]   last couple of years is the quality of the trackpad and the quality of the keyboard.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.920]   That right there, like everything else could be amazing.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.280]   But if those guys feel like a toy, then I never want to use it.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.280]   Period.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.720]   And so if that's going to be the bridge keyboard, then it's not worth it to me.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.920]   Kevin, have you played with the Bluetooth upgrade?
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.520]   I have not installed it on the Pixel Slate because I don't have a Bluetooth keyboard for
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   it.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:33.040]   So other than, let's see, I had my Sony Sony's to watch a couple hours of Netflix last night.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   Bluetooth connected.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.280]   I had no problems.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.600]   But I think it's hit or miss, depending on the device that you're connecting, the type
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.320]   of device, which Bluetooth chip it has, because there are some people in the forums that say,
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.320]   "I don't have any Bluetooth problems," but yet there's a lot of people who do.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.240]   So I don't know what it is.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.320]   Do you have the Bluetooth upgrade?
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.400]   Oh, anybody can get it.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:59.640]   Based in the Chrome flags, you just go in the Chrome flags and it's new blue, any WBLUE
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.480]   just to enable that one.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.000]   You enable it yet?
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Not on the slate.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.320]   I had it on my Pixelbook, but I generally didn't have any Bluetooth problems.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.800]   So I don't know.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.960]   But people can try it if they're having Bluetooth problems on a Pixelbook on any Chromebook,
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:19.800]   actually, just go into the flags and turn new blue on, give that a shot, maybe that'll
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   help.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.480]   It's kind of funny, just real quick, because I don't want to, you know, hock up the whole
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.480]   show with Pixel Slate, but...
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.480]   Oh, please do.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   That's why we're here.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   Just here for it, man.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   No, no, it's just...
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.160]   I mean, I read all the reviews that came out the same day as mine and whatnot, and part
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.000]   of me, for reading something, was like, "Do we use the same device?"
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.080]   Because I couldn't even replicate some of the issues that people said they saw, and I
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.760]   don't doubt that they saw them, but I don't know why I couldn't replicate them.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.280]   There are other mini-legitimate gripes.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.280]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.760]   It needs some work.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.680]   I think everything is very fixable, but I keep hearing...
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.480]   I just heard this a few minutes ago in the conversation here, you know, this is a tablet
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.480]   first.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:05.640]   And I'm like, "Again, I'm not sure I look at it that way, because it has a desktop browser,
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.800]   which is a plus on a tablet.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   No other tablet, say, for Microsoft Surface has a desktop browser.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   The iPad doesn't.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.920]   That actually was the bottleneck for me being as productive as I could be on an iPad Pro.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.680]   So now I can be more productive, I've got the desktop browser.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.440]   So I guess I don't look at it as a tablet first, even though it technically is a slate.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.400]   And if you're going to just buy the slate, then sure, obviously you are looking at it
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.560]   as a tablet.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.160]   But I never even thought about buying it without a keyboard.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:36.160]   To me, this will be my Pixelbook laptop experience when I need it.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.680]   And then when I don't, I can just do what I want to do.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.280]   So just an observation.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:48.440]   And for Android developers, is the Pixelbook slate in tablet form factor mode?
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.480]   Is that a good way to test your apps on a tablet?
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   I would say.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.480]   Well, I mean, you could.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   Let's see.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.480]   I mean, I have Android Studio installed.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.440]   I have a good definitive way to do that.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:04.200]   Well, it's kind of the only way because you can't yet connect an Android phone to over
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:10.480]   USB to any Chrome OS device through Christianity on Linux, because the USB support isn't there
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.480]   yet.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.080]   You have to actually run your app locally.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.360]   So I would think it actually would be a good environment.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.320]   But the better environment would be actually using a phone or multiple phones to test different
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.480]   form factors, I think.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.600]   I haven't installed that Android Studio, but I haven't.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.840]   I don't create Android apps yet.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.040]   So I couldn't say for sure.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   Cool.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.440]   Well, let's take a break because we do have a sponsor to thank.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.480]   And then we'll get back and we'll talk about a whole bunch of other Google stuff.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.680]   We've got a lot in the doc today to get through.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.920]   But first, this episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:49.080]   Obviously, I mean, every single day brings a new security breach, news of a new security
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.840]   breach, and you're like, man, them too.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.040]   And at this point, people are getting kind of complacent, I would argue.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.800]   But hopefully you're concerned about where your data goes.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.520]   That's the most important thing.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:05.000]   If you're making an online purchase, if you're accessing your mail, depending on the scenario,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.840]   you could be putting your private information at risk.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.920]   Because as we know, we're being tracked online, social media sites, marketing companies, your
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.840]   mobile or internet provider, everybody's tracking these days.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.640]   So not only can they record your browsing history, they often sell it to other corporations
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.440]   who want to profit from your information.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.760]   And that's why we've decided to take back privacy by using ExpressVPN.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.440]   Has easy to use apps that run seamlessly in the background.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:37.440]   You can, of course, load it on your computer, your phone, your tablet, apps for all platforms.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.640]   It turns on with a single click.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.880]   And I feel like sometimes VPN solutions can be a little complicated.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.080]   You don't get that complication with ExpressVPN.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.280]   It's super straightforward.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:53.200]   It secures and anonymizes your internet browsing by encrypting your data, hiding your public
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   IP address.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.760]   It allows you to safely surf on public Wi-Fi.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:03.000]   So if you have the coffee shop as the often used example, you can go ahead and activate
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.360]   ExpressVPN and you won't be snooped on.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.960]   You won't have your personal data stolen.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:12.080]   No one can drop in on your data traffic over the Wi-Fi connection.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.560]   It's rated the number one VPN service by TechRadar.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:19.280]   It comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee and costs less than $7 a month.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.600]   If you don't want to hand over your online history to your internet provider or data
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.800]   resellers, ExpressVPN is the answer.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.640]   So protect your online activity today and find out how you can get three extra months
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:36.480]   free with a one-year package at expressvpn.com/twig.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:42.320]   That's expressvpn.com/twig for three extra months free with a one-year package.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.160]   Just visit expressvpn.com/twig and you can learn more and we thank ExpressVPN for their
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.720]   support of this week in Google.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.960]   All right.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.760]   So we talked all about the Pixel Slate here.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.760]   Let's see.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.760]   Oh, I wanted to ask you guys.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.000]   So Pixel 3 users.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.280]   Are we all in that camp at this point or no?
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.640]   Part time.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.640]   Part time?
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.640]   Okay.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   You got the two.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.640]   Just got the two.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.520]   The first time I haven't seen Pixel Envy, I'm stuck with the two.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.520]   Okay.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:19.240]   I'm curious to know why because now the dust has settled.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.680]   I'm very familiar and very used to my Pixel 3.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.240]   I have to say it's been strangely buggy in different places.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.920]   I always expect a little bit of bugging us here and there but on and on, I get these
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:37.520]   weird system hang-ups, things just stall out and then suddenly kick back in out of nowhere.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.960]   My assistant commands are rarely registering.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.120]   I'll say it through assistant and it will get it completely wrong and dive into my contacts
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.560]   and what are you doing?
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:52.400]   I said to navigate to the store and then I have to go into maps to issue the command.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:58.480]   I know that they're issuing a December security patch that's fixing a number of issues but
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.160]   is that part of the reason why you don't have Pixel Envy this year, Jeff?
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.960]   Are you hearing more and more of these reports of oddness with the Pixel 3 or is this something
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.960]   different?
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.320]   No, just simply that I've been happy with Pixel 2 and nothing makes me envious of having
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.320]   the 3 yet.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.320]   Okay.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   Not even night sight.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.520]   Night sight's on two now, isn't it?
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.760]   Night sight's on two.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.840]   I mean, it's, I don't know.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.160]   I have the smaller version.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.200]   I think you have the XL, right, Jeff?
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:33.160]   But man, it's still a great phone and it's expensive.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:38.680]   The Pixel 3 is a lot of money for what didn't seem to be a lot of value.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.760]   If the charging stand thingy came with it, maybe I'd consider it.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.560]   That was the most interesting aspect of that release, actually.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.720]   And I mean, that is not a reason to buy a new phone.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.640]   No, that's another $70 even if you did want it.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.760]   Although I think they had a deal not too long ago where they were including it for like
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:02.120]   a day or whatever, but they've had all sorts of weird deals like that.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.400]   Have you noticed any issues?
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.720]   You say part time, Kevin, on the Pixel 3, but I don't know.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:13.360]   I like are you using it with enough regularity to notice issues?
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.360]   Probably not.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:21.360]   My phone is an iPhone XR mainly because I can't live without the Apple Watch for my running
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.560]   and so on and the whole family is on iPhone.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.600]   So I messages, Apple Music, et cetera.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.480]   So the iPhone is my main phone.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   But I--
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   You're a chick.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.480]   No.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   This is one thing.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.600]   I've prided myself on for 15 years, Jeff.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.520]   I use anything and everything.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.960]   So I have a, hopefully, a broad understanding of what's happening overall on the market.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   I hear, yeah.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.920]   I would love to just pick one and be dumb with it.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.760]   But one time I was using Blackberry and Palm.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.800]   And just like Jason, I'm sure, was using a whole bunch of different operating systems
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.880]   on the phones back in the day.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.960]   But I haven't really seen too many issues, but then I might not be using it enough for
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.240]   certain apps that I use or find and other apps are having issues.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   I don't know.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.200]   I find myself constantly talking myself out of it and being like, no, it's not the phone.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.920]   It's not the phone or something else.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.080]   But then it just keeps on happening.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.040]   And I'm like, OK, well, I don't even know how to reverse engineer this and figure out
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.640]   like what it is because it's definitely happening.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.960]   They definitely had a RAM issue, which I think they have addressed, basically.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.480]   And it sounds like this December security patch includes some sort of tweak around memory
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:38.000]   management that was-- and in this case, it was preventing apps from running simultaneously.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.400]   Like if you're listening to music in the background and then you switch over to the camera to
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.080]   take a picture, you take the picture and it would stop the music in the background, just
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   as one example.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:51.280]   So I don't know if that's the same issue tied into what I've been experiencing.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:58.040]   But I'm trying not to jump to the conclusion of, oh, well, the Pixel 3's buggy is all
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.880]   get out and it's different this time.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.800]   But I can't deny the fact that these issues keep happening for me.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.040]   And I keep hearing other people complaining.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:12.120]   So I don't know if you do something for like a month and it's happening.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.000]   I don't think you're jumping to a conclusion.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.960]   Actually, yeah, no, that's not jumping to a conclusion.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:22.920]   No, but to be honest, I mean, even as an iPhone user, I see with the new brand new iOS big
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:29.720]   version updates or a new phone, for example, you'll see some bugs in the first month.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.840]   They're usually minor, but they've had text messaging bugs, all kinds of issues over there
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.040]   on the Apple side.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.880]   And it takes a 0.1 or 0.2 release to get everything working just right.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.520]   So I don't think it's exclusive to Google by any means.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.360]   Let's see here.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   Should we talk about Flutter?
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.440]   I was hovering on Flutter.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.360]   It's like you read my mind.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.400]   Google officially launched Flutter 1.0.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.040]   It's first stable release.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:03.480]   It's an open source toolkit for a cross platform UI development, it's Android and iOS.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:10.760]   And in reading this article from Rana Mario on Ars Technica, he compares it to game development
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:16.560]   for Unity and that being kind of like a translating into something that can be played on all game
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.000]   systems, similar situation here.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.080]   But I'm not a developer.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.280]   He also said in there, and I thought this might be worth it, I was curious about the
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:29.560]   reason I can guess, but that it's moving from a Java-based environment.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.940]   Flutter is based on Dart, which Google had been focusing on, so in Android is based on
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.940]   Java.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:42.760]   So I didn't know if that was part of the drama with the lawsuits or if that was just
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.440]   like Dart is the future.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.120]   So I was kind of curious about that.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:53.080]   I think Google would like Dart and Kotlin to actually be the future.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:59.160]   Kotlin is basically Java compatible and you can translate between the two quite easily.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.640]   It's actually easier to do certain things in Kotlin and perhaps that's what Android apps
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.760]   will be written in the future.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:12.520]   I think Flutter, my guess is it has a home on pretty much anything because it runs, you
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:19.000]   can create the app once and run it pretty much on anything in a kind of Java.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.240]   And that makes me question what about progressive web apps because that's been Google's big
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.800]   push for a while.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   I don't really know yet.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.560]   But the big thing with Flutter that I can see is really from a developer standpoint and
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:35.120]   I put a link in the show notes after Ron's article because there are a couple of videos
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:40.200]   on Medium, which was written by one of the Google developers for Flutter.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:46.360]   And he shows that if you're using Android Studio and you're booting up the emulator
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:51.480]   to run a Flutter app, it took him two minutes and 40 seconds to do that.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.280]   One of the big things with Flutter is they can just run it natively right there on the
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.280]   desktop.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   It takes 10 seconds.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.200]   So that's a huge time savings if you were a developer right off the bat.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.680]   It's very responsive, kind of like a progressive web app.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:10.040]   So I'd like to read more about it because I'm just getting into Java myself and now I'm
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.080]   like, well, maybe I need to be learning Flutter.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.400]   I don't know yet.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:24.600]   And if you get used to developing these Flutter apps, you might be already preparing yourself
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:31.080]   for the post Android apocalypse of Fuchsia.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.160]   Which Fuchsia runs Flutter apps natively?
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:40.200]   And a lot of people keep pointing to Fuchsia to be the long game for where Google goes
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.880]   next, moving, transitioning from Android to something else.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.320]   But it's all conjecture at this point.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.320]   Fuchsia, go Kevin.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   Go Kevin.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.680]   I wonder if this plays into, and I don't think we have this on the show notes, but it's actually,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.040]   I'm glad we went this way.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:07.400]   Microsoft is getting rid of Edge apparently, reportedly, to go to a Chromium-based browser.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.600]   And that's probably going to shift their approach of applications to progressive web
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.680]   apps.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.640]   I would mean that they use Flutter too.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   I don't know.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.960]   They don't need to if they're going to go with progressive web apps.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:26.200]   But I just wonder what's going on with Microsoft and how it relates here.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.440]   Because they're kind of throwing the towel in on Edge and going with the Chromium, the
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:35.680]   open source Chromium browser reportedly that Google uses.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.680]   So.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:41.240]   Yeah, it seems like a very big sudden kind of shift away.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.440]   It's super familiar with Microsoft at this point.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.840]   But that really took me by surprise.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:56.040]   I think they do an operating system that I think I've maybe seen once in my life.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.440]   But that seems like a really big, really big admission to some degree that they would take
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.840]   their web browser and shift it so drastically like that.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.920]   Who knows where that leads?
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   Let's see here.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.160]   Talk a little bit about search.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.960]   You guys want to talk about search?
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.040]   Got a number of kind of juicy nuggets here.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.720]   Privacy search engine, DuckDuckGo.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.920]   Conducted a study that's well, obviously they're a competitor.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.160]   So take it with a grain of salt.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:30.800]   But seems to show that Google search personalizes results even when a user is logged out of
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.840]   their Google account and when that user is using incognito mode.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.040]   They did this in June of this year.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:44.440]   They used search terms that were highly specific in divisive things like gun control, immigration,
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.920]   vaccinations.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.680]   In all cases, they did the first search with all people while they were logged out or in
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.480]   incognito mode on a machine.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.120]   And then they logged in immediately after and did the same search to kind of compare
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.480]   the results between the two.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:05.880]   And most users saw the same results as they saw while logged out.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:11.520]   The report seems to indicate a heavy amount of personalization going on even when they're
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:16.240]   logged out, even when they're in some sort of privacy mode with no clear indication as
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.920]   far as why or what it's actually based on.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:26.320]   Google of course calls the methodology of the report flawed Danny Sullivan, friend of
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.720]   the show.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:33.720]   Also Google's publicly eyes on for search said on Twitter had a whole kind of tweet
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.120]   storm on this but basically said over the years, the methods to develop the Google search
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:42.280]   personalizes so much that for the same query, different people might get significantly different
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.560]   results from each other.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:49.400]   This isn't the case results can differ but usually for non personalized reasons.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:58.720]   So what you all think it does duck.go make a compelling case here and should it matter?
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.400]   I think it does matter because the idea of doing incognito means that you're not sharing
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.040]   information with Google.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.440]   So that definitely matters.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.640]   It is hard to say.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.960]   I think this is one of those gray areas where as we get more abstract, it's really hard
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:19.080]   to understand what's going on behind the scenes and Google may be right and duck duck
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.400]   go maybe right.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:26.000]   But what I mean here is there could be technicalities that are making things more personalized
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:35.020]   that Google will argue is not personalized but is really based on maybe your IP address
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.160]   as location or something like that.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:43.800]   So I think it's going to be hard to say, it's going to be hard to parse if that makes
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.600]   sense.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:51.400]   And that's a shame because it is, I don't know, I mean, I don't use incognito mode except
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:57.360]   when I'm trying to test out random Google features but if you're hardcore believing in
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.760]   incognito mode, this would be really kind of devastating.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:10.880]   I use incognito to test ads on my website because I want to see what a random person
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.760]   might see.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.560]   So theoretically it should be totally random ads.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:20.160]   But honestly, every once in a while, maybe even a little more than that, I see ads for
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:24.720]   things that I know I've searched for very recently outside of incognito mode.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.680]   So I don't know, I'm not saying it's an issue one way or the other.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:39.400]   But I think Danny did a great job trying to explain it and I'd like to test a little
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.400]   bit more personally.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:46.800]   And I think it's hard to say, I mean, there's so many elements now.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:53.920]   You've got your device itself, you've got your version of whatever browser you're using,
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:59.280]   you've got your location, you've got your ISP, all of that can factor into it without
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.240]   being super personalized, right?
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:09.960]   And then the flip side is I used to use DuckDuckGo and I found it frustrating because Google's
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.560]   results were typically more relevant for me because they were personalized.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:21.880]   So I think a greater transparency here in how this works and what Google uses might
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:27.280]   be interesting or rather really relevant to people who care about this sort of thing.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:33.240]   But I don't see that happening anytime soon.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.920]   Dragonfly, the China search engine.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.960]   Here we go.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.520]   Codename for Google's plan censored search engine in China was kept secret both internally
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.240]   and externally by those close to the project.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:52.120]   There's a new report on the intercept that has Yonatan Zungar.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.200]   I don't believe he's been a guest on, but I follow him on.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   He should be.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.280]   Yeah, he'd be an amazing guest.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.680]   14 year veteran of Google on the record along with others who still work on the project
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:08.760]   who chose to be anonymous, of course, talking about the lengths that they went to in order
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:12.360]   to keep all of it below the radar.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.440]   At one point they raised concerns about Chinese citizens being detained for searches that
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:21.480]   were conducted, but head of operations, Scott Beaumont, wasn't convinced and that led to
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:26.200]   executives shutting out Google's own security and privacy teams from the meetings.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.840]   Also, sidelining privacy review, which was led by Yonatan at the time.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:35.800]   This was prior to him leaving Google, which he said he would have left for another reason,
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:40.960]   but if he had stayed on, he would have left because of this because he was so divided
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.400]   against everybody else on this, that would have analyzed human rights abuses.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:52.680]   So making a lot of these decisions internally to say, let's sidestep these people because
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.880]   we don't want to focus too hard on these things.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:00.800]   Let's continue forward with this search engine in China.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.320]   What you guys think?
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.320]   Leave this one.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.320]   I attended Google Lord knows.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.120]   I have defended Facebook.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.240]   Facebook's making it hard to defend them sometimes these days.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:14.040]   And full disclosure, as I received money from my school, from Facebook that I'm independent
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:18.160]   of them, I received nothing from Google personally or from any of the platforms.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.760]   But this one, I applauded Google when they pulled out of China.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.920]   I applauded this stuff on principle and I do not see what has changed.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.680]   It would make them go back.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:34.160]   And so I'm very disappointed that Google is considering this and considering it against
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.160]   the numbers.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.720]   Maybe it's a very small number of their employees because they're so huge, but it is a fervent
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.680]   belief of some of their employees that they're going the wrong way.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.720]   And I think you can get a listen to that.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:48.160]   Now, the significant, I was talking, I heard somebody talk from the intelligence community
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:55.480]   the other day saying that Google's relationship with government overall is bad right now because
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:00.000]   of the pullback on drones and other military related things.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.680]   And the intelligence people say, Google would be helping save the lives of service people
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   if they were involved in these projects.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.680]   I get that.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.160]   I can go both ways on that.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.720]   That's a US consideration.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.840]   But I certainly understand the conscience of the Google employees who object to those
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:17.920]   projects.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.320]   That's a US base.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.920]   In terms of working with the Chinese government, it's real hard for me to justify that in any
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   way.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.760]   I'm disappointed in Google on this.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:35.960]   I was ready to argue with Jeff because I think it's a moral and awful and a real big issue.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:43.560]   But I can't because Jeff, Jeff actually, well, like, oh man, now what do I do?
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:50.120]   I could argue, I guess I could play devil's advocate and argue that China is a big economic
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.440]   opportunity.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.520]   It would be stupid of Google to pass this up.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.840]   I as a person though, don't believe that to be true.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:01.120]   So I will just make that as an intellectual toss that out there.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.920]   And that's all I can do here.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.720]   If you were a shareholder, how would you feel about this?
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.680]   Even as a shareholder.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.360]   I mean, think about like, if I were a shareholder back in the 80s for a company that supported
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.800]   apartheid, I would be like, no, no, we should not be doing this.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.720]   I am a shareholder.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:24.400]   And from that position, I think that all the platforms now are going to have to act ethically
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.640]   and morally.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.560]   And when they do not, it is in the long run going to bite them in the rear end witness
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.320]   what's happening in Facebook right now.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:36.840]   If you don't start with a high moral plane as an objective, when you have this control
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:41.280]   over the world, when you have this much power, then I think it's going to hurt you as a company.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.520]   And you can say it's true of Amazon and Twitter.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:49.400]   Although when we start talking about moral arguments, it does get dicey because different
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:53.920]   people, different organizations are going to have different moral.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:54:00.040]   I mean, I may, I can argue that, hey, participating with the Chinese government and possibly aiding
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:07.120]   it abetting their censorship and even murder, political murder of their citizens, I don't
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   agree with that.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:12.240]   But other people might be like, well, you know, Google's still flying their employees
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.840]   to conferences and that's contributing to climate change.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.160]   And I don't agree with that.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.280]   So I'm purposely picking very far apart issues.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   But as we as a country.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   There's a thing moral purity, don't I pray every day?
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:33.160]   But so you're right, Stacy, but to select a moral stand and then stand by it.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.160]   And so Google stood, chose a moral position years ago by China.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.360]   And I haven't seen the reason that changes.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.360]   That's fair.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.560]   Except for what you said, playing the devil's advocate just moments ago, Stacy, which is
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.800]   that there's a big opportunity there.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.520]   Of course, we're going to explore it.
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.960]   And that's that's dang it.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.800]   The devil's advocate wins.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.960]   Jim is speaking.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:02.920]   Yes, I know the gin is slowly but surely seeping in there.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:07.040]   And, you know, apparently, according to this report, there were only a few hundred people
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.040]   that knew about it.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.040]   Their jobs ran the risk of termination if they discussed it with anybody, which I feel
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.880]   like that that makes sense, right?
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.280]   Like it's pretty normal.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.800]   Yeah, pretty standard stuff.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:21.480]   And communication would happen verbally, so they would almost insist on everything being
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.800]   verbally minimizing a paper trail.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.000]   I mean, they obviously knew how divisive of an issue this would be.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.160]   They said the report says their biggest fear was that internal opposition would slow our
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.320]   operations.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:39.640]   And then, of course, now there's a looming strike that's kind of on the forefront, you
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:45.400]   know, a number of employees are I think employees at Google and other large corporations like
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:50.720]   this are starting to realize that when they don't agree, this is actually a really effective
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:54.120]   way to do things is to shut down business and strike.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.120]   And so they're flexing that muscle more and more.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.960]   And that's that's a good thing.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   Hopefully that applies to the pressure.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.640]   Anytime you do something, yeah, anytime you have to do something in utter secret from,
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:08.720]   you know, like your family or your close friends, like you're like, hmm, nobody I know in love
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.920]   or none of my employees would agree for this.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.080]   So we're going to have to keep it super secret.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   Right.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   You're probably doing something pretty.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.960]   Yeah, that checks that box.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.760]   That's a sign.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:19.760]   Maybe we don't.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.560]   Yeah, except every so much of what they do is secret for other reasons.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.400]   There's a secrecy reflex that's all too well.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   Exercise.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.400]   This is a high.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.840]   I mean, doing only verbal communication.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.520]   That's I mean, Kevin, you've been inside Google.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:38.120]   That seems that's that I would I would not say that's very standard practice there.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.680]   It's not the SOP.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:47.440]   Oh, speaking of the Google employees, what about their latest memo on contract workers?
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:52.840]   So this, I feel like I was out of the loop when this broke probably shortly before the
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.340]   show, right?
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:57.240]   So I didn't get a chance to read through this.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:00.960]   So if one of you knows more of the details on this, feel free.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.960]   Go for it.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.200]   I didn't get to this one before reading it.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.200]   Hold on.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   Let me make sure it's the thing I think it is.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.760]   This is the Bloomberg article, right?
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:13.000]   Googlers, right to CEO demanding equal treatment for contractors.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.560]   That's about all I know.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:21.440]   So they actually they had put that into their original kind of sexual harassment, their
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.840]   letter in demands over sexual harassment.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.760]   And that was ignored.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:31.960]   So today they sent full time and contract workers sent a letter to Sundar Pichai asking
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:38.280]   for them to improve the conditions for their contract workers.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.680]   And I'm like, what are those improvements?
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.480]   Let's see.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:49.160]   I thought I saw something about communications when there was a major issue.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.200]   Like, I forget what issue they had.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   Maybe they had to.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   Oh, it was.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.200]   Okay.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.200]   Yeah, they said when a shooting when the shooting happened at YouTube's campus, the contractors
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:05.000]   didn't get the same communications because they were in a different system.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.280]   It's just like apps for a tweet.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.640]   G Suite versus Gmail.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.640]   All right.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.640]   Everybody on G Suite ran outside.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:19.080]   Oh, one's G Suite one.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:22.800]   I can I can kind of speak to that because I actually was a contract worker there.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.000]   I was not a full time employee.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.720]   I was a TVC as they call it.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:33.720]   And some communications were filtered through a TVC manager, which would be somewhere else
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.800]   maybe across the country, wherever.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.520]   So yes, I could see that being an issue.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:46.120]   I would say in my experience, had I ever been in that situation, I was surrounded by full
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:50.640]   time Googlers who did have the communications and they certainly wouldn't say, hey, we're
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.080]   all going to lunch outside.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.080]   You stay here.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:56.000]   I mean, they would have said we got to get out of here.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.480]   Should that be the standard base level of communication?
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.640]   No, but I it never affected me in a year and a half.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.520]   Well, that sounds almost accidental.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.680]   But what is TVC taking business here of?
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:09.680]   What is this TVC?
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.960]   Oh, Tim Stender's contractors.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.720]   TVC, Vicki is in Victor.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.520]   TVC, right.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.520]   Tim Stender contractors.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.520]   Yes.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.800]   Later on, they get to these complaints in here and these sound very I can see this happening,
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.440]   but I can also see this not being the standard, but being excellent to put in a news article
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.400]   because it's wonderful.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:33.520]   One contractor described a full time staffer asking her to move from an office desk or
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.160]   cutting ahead of her in line for coffee because she was a contractor and therefore not as
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.160]   important.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:43.200]   That's a typical, I think.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.200]   That is very.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.400]   That feels like a jerk thing to do.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.400]   But there are, I mean, I think there's some real issues here.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:55.040]   I think there's sure being on communications is easy to be like, hey, please tell us things
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.560]   that concern our safety.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.560]   That's fixable.
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.120]   I think the bigger issue is people are often contracting for positions that used to be
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:08.200]   full time to avoid paying for things like health care and to avoid certain legal requirements
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.800]   that come with having a full time worker.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:19.160]   I think if you are a huge company with, I think they say it was like 60,000 contractors.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.960]   I may be making that number up.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.400]   Let's wait before I say that.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:30.600]   With lots of contractors, they don't actually give a number in this one.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.560]   If you have that many contractors and they're doing those kind of jobs, maybe they should
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560]   be full time.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.520]   I understand the financial reasons why you wouldn't do that because paying for health
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.320]   insurance kind of sucks.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.560]   Someone's actually a full time employee and everything but name only, then they should
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.640]   be an employee.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.400]   This is the issue for our time.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.520]   This is the big labor issue for the current generation.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.800]   Yeah, it seems that way.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:03.040]   Let's take a break and then we will come back and we'll talk about more.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:08.280]   Maybe we will go off the Google Trail a little bit and talk about the big Facebook news that
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:14.000]   has been breaking this afternoon with the UK Parliament releasing redacted copies of
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   some pretty sensitive Facebook documents.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   Maybe we'll talk about that.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   Maybe we won't.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.560]   We'll find out here in a few minutes.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.920]   I'll let that stew stew with you guys.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.320]   You can let me know if you want to go there.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.520]   This week in Google is brought to you by a rocket mortgage by quick and loans.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:34.360]   If you're looking to buy a home, you're probably paying attention to the interest rates and
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.640]   realizing, hey, they are rising slowly but surely they are rising.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.280]   That can cause a little bit of anxiety because you don't know if now is the time or if you
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.440]   wait, it's going to rise too high or when are those changes happening?
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.040]   It's just everything super unpredictable.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.920]   It makes a stressful situation even more stressful.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.520]   Our friends at Quick and Loans are doing something about that.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:59.520]   They're calling it the power buying process and it's super simple.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.120]   First step, you answer a few simple questions.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.720]   They're going to check your credit and out of that you'll get pre-qualified approval.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.960]   It would be pre-qualified to start looking for your home.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.440]   Step two, Quick and Loans will verify your income, your assets and your credit.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.440]   It doesn't take long.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.280]   It only takes less than around 24 hours.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.840]   That's going to give you a verified approval.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.240]   When you have that verified approval, that gives you the strength of a cash buyer.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.880]   You can really start looking.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:32.120]   Step three, once you're verified, you then qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:37.200]   approval, which basically means they're going to lock up your rate at that particular point.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:42.120]   Whatever happens to be for up to 90 days while you shop, so it's not going anywhere.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:47.040]   The best part is if the Fed raises the rates, if those rates go up, your rate is going to
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.240]   stay locked in for up to 90 days.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.280]   If the rates happen to drop, if they go down, your rate goes down with it.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.520]   Either way, you win.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:01.400]   It's the awesome thinking that you'd expect from America's largest mortgage lender.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.600]   To get started and to learn more about all this, go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.840]   Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quick and Loans data in comparison
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.560]   to public data records.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:25.160]   Housing lender, licensed in all 50 states, nmlsconsumeraccess.org 3030.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.920]   That's rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.360]   We thank Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans for their support of this week in Google.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.840]   Want to talk about Facebook?
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.400]   Or should we stay with Google?
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.640]   What do you guys think?
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:43.080]   I like Google more than Facebook, but if we want to talk about Facebook, I'm ready.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.920]   I just thought it was big breaking news.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.320]   It's like taking over tech meme right now.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320]   You don't have to.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   We could talk about it.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.240]   No, I mean, to me it's like, "Oh, hey, Facebook is kind of evil and uses data in ways that
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.000]   they've told you they don't use your data and oh my gosh, news at 10."
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.440]   Here's another example of Facebook being evil, basically.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.600]   Yeah, it's bad.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.680]   Again, this is why I'm like, "Eh, no Facebook."
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.520]   But if there's deeper depth here, if someone wants to defend Facebook, I'm looking at you,
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.520]   Jeff, you go right ahead.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.520]   No, I don't understand.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.520]   I haven't run enough.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.520]   I don't understand.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:23.880]   I mean, every media company there is, and I'm not calling the platform as a media company,
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.160]   but you're in the media business.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:31.760]   Everyone in the media business, with that way, uses whatever data they have to increase
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.520]   the value of what they've offered out of our touches.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.520]   Full stop.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520]   Right?
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520]   The difference is Facebook has more.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.000]   So what I haven't understood in this story is because I have not read enough of it because
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:53.440]   I was out today is what makes this different from what time ink would have done with data
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.040]   they had about users at a specific time.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.800]   Timing is very disorganized with their data compared to Facebook.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   No.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.520]   True, there's still be a lot of just time ink.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:10.720]   But they would use whatever data they had even back in the print days in essence, even
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.640]   to the even to mailing addresses with advertisers.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:19.080]   So I'm not sure what's shady about this.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.400]   That's not a defense.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.760]   That's an I don't get the story yet.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:28.720]   So part of it is Facebook is looking at, so there's the data sharing, but there's also
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:35.640]   that Facebook's would, it would track popularity of certain apps through their platform and
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.760]   monitor their success and then use that to compete against them.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.800]   It's actually the same thing that Amazon does when it comes to launching new features for
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   like AWS.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.960]   So that is not inherently evil.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.800]   That's just how platforms participate.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:59.800]   So they also talk about how Facebook gives some companies access to data, but not other
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.280]   apps access to user data.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:08.640]   So the quote that the UK government government said is the files show evidence of Facebook
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.720]   taking aggressive positions against apps with the consequence that denying them access
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.160]   to data led to the failure of their businesses.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:22.000]   And then if you look at it that way, that's kind of part of the, you know, you're on a
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   platform.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.640]   It's not a neutral place.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.040]   You live and die by the platform, you know, so.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040]   Right.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:32.200]   March advertisers, the volume discounts that others don't get large suppliers to Walmart
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.720]   get benefits that others don't get.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.040]   Again, I'm not defending because I don't know enough.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:42.120]   Somebody can come in and tell us what makes this in any context bad.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:46.560]   But on its face, I don't see something new there.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:55.440]   So someone pointed out, oh, that it violated an FTC agreement that Facebook had signed.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.840]   And if that case, that's just illegal.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.880]   But this is a long series of tweets.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.000]   And I'm not reading all of them at the moment.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.680]   So I'm not 100% sure how that works.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.080]   This is why you didn't want to talk about this.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:12.160]   This is why I'm like, oh, well, I'm just like, oh, do I really want to know how deeply
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.880]   Facebook is screwing people over?
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:19.080]   I don't know that there's anything really different, Jeff, going along with what you
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.280]   said, different say than what time used to do, et cetera.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:27.400]   I think that the issue is it's just a constant theme with Facebook.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.120]   It's just over and over and over again.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.880]   They kind of get caught doing things that a we question.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:38.600]   They'd be doing it all and B, we wouldn't know unless they got caught.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   That's right.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.400]   I think it's the sneakiness in a sense.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.720]   And I don't know if that's the best word.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.720]   This is good.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.360]   Can you tell us the sneakiness here?
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.360]   I'll put it in here.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.280]   Everything gets interpreted with the sneaky classes now.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.280]   No, this is actually sneaky.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280]   Okay.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280]   That's my problem.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.880]   I sometimes I can't tell what's sneaky.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.880]   What is it?
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.880]   Here we go.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   I'm dropping this in here for you.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.880]   Oh, I see.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:09.920]   Here's a Twitter thing that breaks down the level of sneakiness from the actual documents,
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.320]   which is always nice to see the actual documents.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.400]   So if you it's talking about with the Android phones, oh, hey, look, a tie into Google.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.480]   It seems to show that they said, hey, by the way, we need to let people positively opt
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.120]   into this data.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.720]   There it is right there.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:32.240]   So if you click on those documents there, they basically right here, they're like, hey,
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.880]   we need to do opt in.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.440]   And then the next one is like, hey, never mind.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.400]   We're only going to request this without the personal opt in.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.840]   So that actually does look a little shifty.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.520]   That's pretty right.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.560]   They said they actually said in these emails.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:55.560]   And also like along with this UK lawmakers actually published these emails that I guess
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.440]   they got a hold of last week related to something else.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.960]   And so I thought that was just kind of weird.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960]   Like, hey, we got this stuff.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960]   We want everybody to see it.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.960]   Here you go.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.040]   And then Facebook's doing damage control.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:11.840]   But within these emails, like Facebook's changed the Android app policy that resulted
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.880]   in what we were just talking about, the call message data being recorded that we heard
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.720]   about a month ago.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.720]   It was deliberately hidden from users.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.240]   Facebook knew that it would be risky, but then they decide in those emails, yeah, but
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.800]   let's just do it anyways.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800]   Things like that.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.920]   And kind of tying with what you said, Kevin, it's like this constant pattern of, no, we
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.760]   didn't do that.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.880]   Something is published that shows that they did it.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.880]   Yeah, we did that.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.120]   But it's not as bad as you think.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.120]   They're getting it wrong.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.120]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   I don't know.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.920]   It feels very familiar at this point.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.720]   They don't say it's not as bad as you say.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.880]   They just say, oh, yeah, sorry about that.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:53.520]   And Zuck gets up and writes this heartfelt long blog post about how privacy is overrated,
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.880]   how it understands, we're different, we're moving along in this continuum.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.960]   This isn't the full story.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.840]   You're not getting the full story.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840]   And I think that's part of the part.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.840]   Yeah, I've been struggling for months.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.840]   There's a piece that I've been supposed to write for somebody else for a long, long time.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.760]   And I have a horrible writer's block on it is to look at the moral basis of behavior of
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.760]   the platforms.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.680]   And it's hard to know where to start, which sounds like a straight line.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   I don't mean it that way.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.360]   But it's hard to know where you set the bar versus other companies.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:27.360]   Steve Avadianathan argued what would Google do that I was seeing the company wrong because
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.000]   it can't be any better than any company out there.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.600]   It's going to operate like any company out there.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.000]   You're wrong to expect anything positive to them, basically.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.520]   And I still disagree with Steve on that, but I get it and I especially get it in the current
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.480]   context and the discussion we've just had in the last half hour.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:49.040]   And so, but these companies are extremely powerful and they're going to be watched over
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.600]   and they've got to operate on a moral plane.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.600]   And what is that plane?
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.960]   And I'm having trouble trying to figure out how to express that.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.680]   Don't be evil.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.480]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.480]   Yeah, it sounds familiar.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.200]   I mean, it's...
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:10.440]   I mean, in the context of being a human being, I mean, if I think about me as a teenager versus
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:15.360]   me today, you know, I have done some pretty crappy things, even knowing they were kind
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360]   of crappy.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.560]   And now that I'm older, I'm like, oh, those are really crappy.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:25.760]   So, as a company, you have a bunch of individuals making these decisions and they're influenced
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.960]   by the people at the top.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.400]   And currently at different companies, I think you start with the goals of people at the
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.120]   top and their founding kind of creators and cultural ethos.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.120]   And I think Facebook started out in the kind of...
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:48.080]   With a lot fewer assets at the top, right, in terms of like having a good moral compass
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:52.240]   and it just spiraled from there.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.560]   The entire ethos of the company followed down that road.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.560]   Sweet, true man.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.520]   How about we shift towards where we hope... where we aspire to be someday?
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:10.640]   And that's the highest paid YouTubers in the world.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.120]   Apparently number one, according to Forbes, so Forbes Every Year publishes a list of the
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.120]   highest paid YouTube stars.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.480]   2018 list is upon us.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:25.120]   At the very top is Ryan Toys Review, a seven year old that has 17 million followers, has
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:30.480]   a toy line at Walmart, apparently, and made $22 million.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.480]   $22 million.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.800]   I haven't heard of any of these people.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.000]   I almost wrote that in my notes.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.680]   Let's talk about a bunch of people we've never heard of, but their household names do a
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.960]   whole lot of people.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.920]   Number two, Jake Paul, of course, Logan's younger brother, rapper, prankster.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.200]   I didn't know he was a rapper.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.680]   I knew he was a prankster.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.680]   $21.5 million.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.560]   Dude perfect in third place, $20 million.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.240]   Oh, their videos are great.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.240]   Trick shot.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.280]   It's the only one I know on this list, I think.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.560]   They do a bunch of the trick shot stuff, so you can kind of see it up there at the top.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.040]   PewDiePie, of course, is still on the list, though.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.600]   I believe at some point, at one point, maybe it was last year, PewDiePie dominated this
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.600]   list, right?
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.280]   It was near the top.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:21.920]   Now number nine, only a Paul tree, $15.5 million last year.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.920]   I don't know that his income has gone down, so much of those others have gone up.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.920]   Yeah, right.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.080]   Wow, it just goes to show the crazy network effect of YouTube.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.360]   Isn't that unbelievable?
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:37.320]   And then number 10, Logan Paul, who we've heard a lot of, unfortunately, this last year.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.440]   I know too much about Logan Paul, I've never seen a single video.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.000]   $14.5 million.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.600]   That's crazy.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.680]   This whole thing is crazy.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:51.200]   I'm just looking at this and, well, I'm wondering where are all the ASMR videos that my daughter
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.720]   apparently still listens to.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.480]   And all of the, this is a YouTube trend.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.120]   It's lo-fi music.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.120]   Is that what it's called?
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120]   Lo-fi?
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.560]   Help me out here, chat room, or people who might be not 40 years old.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.560]   What's lo-fi?
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.560]   Lo-fi music.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:13.440]   It's like, if you Google it, you will find the YouTube stuff.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.920]   Chill hop.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.760]   It's basically like chill, study music.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.760]   Oh, okay.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:19.760]   And if you, but if you play it.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.000]   I think like eight-bit music or something.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.240]   No, but it's everywhere.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.960]   And like my child listens to it and vise did a story about it in July about how lo-fi
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.240]   hip hop radio became a YouTube phenomenon.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.680]   And it's true.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.680]   It's weird.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.600]   I should convince my daughter to come on here and talk briefly about YouTube.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.000]   She's way ahead of this stuff.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.240]   Yeah, because I guess music like this is easy to work on and not get too distracted by the
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.240]   words.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.280]   And yeah, I can see it.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.280]   She works and has a YouTube video in the background that's just providing the music,
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:02.320]   which I'm like, as a, as a person who grew up on dial up, I'm like, that is hugging a
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.320]   lot of bandwidth right now.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.600]   Don't you know, long distance, cost of fortune, young lady?
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.600]   Exactly.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.240]   Why don't you just download your chill hop?
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.200]   Like I would have done when I was a kid.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.280]   So I thought I'd seen like some popular lo-fi or ASMR stuff on this list, but I did not.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.120]   It was mostly just guys who perked.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.440]   No, that's the next, like that's, that's the trend that's threatening to take over.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.440]   Sure.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.520]   A couple of years from now, it's going to be dominated with ASMR.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.560]   So I don't actually know that.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.320]   And if I did, I'd be doing that because that's a lot of money.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.840]   I was about to say, it's really easy to make this stuff.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:49.200]   You just got to get the right microphone and do that in the mic, in the mic a lot.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.200]   YouTube hit five billion installs.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.400]   I feel like that's not really, really that surprising.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:59.320]   Google core apps always hit crazy numbers and downloads on the Play Store.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.480]   So I'm surprised YouTube didn't hit it sooner, to be honest.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.360]   There's got to be something more meaty to bite our teeth into.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.320]   What am I missing here?
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:12.400]   We've already talked.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.400]   Hangouts.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.560]   Oh, so Narpachai going to testify before the House Committee.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.680]   It was supposed to happen today, actually.
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:19.680]   Right.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:20.720]   It was supposed to happen today.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:27.760]   Of course, the funeral, the ceremony for George H.W. Bush was today.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.840]   So it got postponed.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:37.280]   So Narpachai heading to the House Judiciary Committee on December 11th, 10 a.m. Eastern.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.280]   And I'm sure he's going to talk a lot about what we were just talking about earlier with
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:46.480]   Dragonfly, potentially also conservative bias and search results, power of Google algorithms
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.160]   and data privacy and a competitive behavior.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.000]   It's going to be a fun time.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.880]   I don't know.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.040]   I'm sure there'll be some news from there.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.800]   I thought what, since that hasn't happened yet, I thought this story was actually kind
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.200]   of cool, which was the Google and Amazon to offer air pod alternatives and talking about
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.280]   how Apple is likely to add health sensors to their stuff.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.480]   The reason I just thought that was neat is because I've talked to a scientist who studies
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.040]   hearing and all the stuff you can do with your ears.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:25.080]   And you can actually get super granular heartbeat, oxygen, and even data that can be interpreted
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:31.000]   to give a sense of focus, how focused you are at this moment in time.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.480]   So if you want a sneak peek of if Apple's adding health sensors, those might be some
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.680]   of the features that you would see, much better quality on something like that, which means
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.840]   you wouldn't just have to have an Apple Watch for health monitoring.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.200]   You could just have air pods, which opens that up to a lot more people.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.920]   I was excited by that.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.120]   It is interesting, I'm kind of stuck on the implementation of that because I do wear an
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.680]   Apple Watch every day and I run with the watch and the air pods.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:04.720]   And I track everything with the Apple Watch and I get my music from the air pods.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.760]   And okay, so now we're going to have wireless things that track my health data from my ears,
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.720]   which is great, but how do I get my music?
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:16.000]   I still need a wearable device with music on it.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.840]   Okay, sure, well, that's when you've got your watch on you and you're running, but the
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:26.720]   rest of us who don't run people like me perhaps, I'm just going to carry my phone and have
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.400]   that and I could get my health data from that.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.880]   So I don't need the watch.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.040]   So Kevin's the phone time he's least like he really watches when he sweats on it, but
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.000]   if you go ahead and wear it all the rest of the time.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.160]   Well, I pretty much wear it all the time.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.160]   It's ridiculous.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.240]   Yeah, I can call Kevin on his watch like anywhere.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.240]   It's a little disconcerting.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.680]   I'm like, please, please don't pick up the phone.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.080]   I'm outside from the house.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.400]   This is not a bathroom thing.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.200]   This is just like.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:02.080]   I mean, I guess it's, I mean, we're saying that your pods or your phones or your buds
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.360]   are the next smartwatch because of tracking.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.360]   I don't know.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:12.200]   I just think if you want to get data on like focus or if you want to get data on like
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.480]   your, you know, I don't think it's like a continuous heart rate monitor kind of thing
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:21.000]   because you're probably not listening to them all the time.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   But I think to get like a picture of like health and I, and I don't know what data Apple
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   actually needs for their like arrhythmia.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.360]   I don't know, Jeff, if you know this for like tracking that sort of stuff.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:34.360]   But if you have your headphones in.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.200]   Well, it's really kind of a circuit.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.280]   That's one of the watches actually suspect for I was talking to a doctor about this for
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.760]   the, for the arrhythmia.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.920]   That's why the card is better because you hold down both hands.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.920]   So you get a complete circuit.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:51.720]   Interesting about the, but the ear is you could get a complete circuit across two devices.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:58.120]   I'm going to get more like maybe I don't know.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.760]   Listen to the heartbeat.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:04.280]   Cause don't we all, you know, when we go to sleep, we hear our heartbeat, right?
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.640]   Cause it's coursing through our ears.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.960]   I wonder with highly sensitive mics.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.280]   Oh, they don't use microphones.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.240]   It's a separate sensor that they do.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.400]   It's a, it's the type of, um, what do they call it with the green light, like on your
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.400]   fitness thing?
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.040]   Paul, who is it?
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.680]   Accimiter, pulse, uh, pulse oximeter.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.240]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.840]   They actually use those kinds of sensors.
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.600]   I did a, there's a woman I did a podcast with her name is Poppy Crumb.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.600]   And she works at Bose.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.680]   And we had this fascinating discussion of like all the things you can sense in your
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.720]   ear better than you could sense it like on your wrist.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.360]   You know, we can go to the moon.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.040]   We can create a self driving car.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.640]   Can they finally just create your buzz?
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.640]   It will stay in my friggin ears.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.400]   I have some duct tape.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.400]   They don't have a lot of fun.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.400]   They don't stay in.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.400]   They just fall out.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:52.840]   I got weird ears.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:56.880]   The Jabra Elite 65 tees are my favorites.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.400]   They totally stay in my ears.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.400]   They're great.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.400]   Mine too.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400]   Do they hurt though?
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   Mine hurt after.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:07.160]   So after like, if I'm on a plane three hours, I have to take them out in my ear, like the,
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:11.520]   whatever that little world is around the edge of your ear hole, that hurts.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.640]   I know what you're talking about because I've had it with other headphones.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.360]   I don't get it with these, but I have seen complaints about from other people on the
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.080]   same same thing.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:25.000]   And also the Broggy Dash Pro ear earphones.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.600]   They have a heart rate monitor embedded in them too.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.920]   So some of these actually do take your heart rate through your ear already.
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.320]   So because Apple doesn't invent new things.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.000]   No, but just make old things better.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.600]   They take a formula and they make it better, I guess.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:44.720]   So they stay in just because they have a little rubber to be things that stick in or?
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.280]   They are definitely the kind that kind of smush in there a little bit, but they don't
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.720]   smush in so far that like, what is the name?
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.920]   I can't remember the other earphones that I used to use all the time.
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:00.760]   When you put those in, they would secure into place, but it's almost like they'd go so
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:04.360]   far that it would like suction your ear and things would get louder.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.760]   And I hate that.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:09.200]   I dealt with it with those and then I tried the job, right?
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.200]   It leads.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.200]   I was like, wait a minute, these stay in my ear and they don't do that anymore.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.680]   And for me, they're very comfortable and I love them.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.040]   Yeah, you kind of jam.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.920]   You put them in like at an angle and then you twist them in.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:22.000]   Yeah, kind of lock it in place.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.120]   And it feels like putting in like a smoke detector or any one of those devices.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.120]   Totally.
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.120]   Totally.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.120]   It's the perfect.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.680]   Yeah, that's the perfect comparison strangely enough.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.840]   Yes.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.840]   So those are good.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:38.880]   I'm really surprised that Google hasn't come out with their own AirPod alike because they
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.880]   have the Pixel Buds.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.040]   Well, they came out, remember, with those the buds and those are terrible.
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.200]   Yeah, they have the Pixel Buds and those have the cable between the two.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.440]   So they're definitely their minds are there.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.720]   I guess they seem where they go.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.000]   I would like Google probably they probably shouldn't.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.160]   I don't figure out messaging and then they can do it.
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.080]   Take care of the first and we'll save lives.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.440]   Yeah, take care of the things you know you need to take care of.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.520]   Waymo one is launching today.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.960]   Phoenix Metro area.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.920]   There's obviously it's the commercial taxi service by Waymo.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.680]   They had promised to start the commercial service by the end of the year.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.160]   They got there.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:19.640]   Although apparently there's going to be is only going to be offered to early riders who
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.800]   were already testing this prior prior to this.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.120]   Those early riders were subject to an NDA.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:31.280]   So we'll probably start hearing more now that it's officially out there for these riders
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.320]   about the experience and what it's all like.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:38.840]   There will be someone sitting in the safety drivers sitting in the cab to be able to take
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:44.080]   over and I guess prices similar to what you get from Uber and Lyft.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.000]   So Waymo one coming to a Phoenix near you.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.680]   That's a hilarious name.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:54.960]   Those are I had seen some of those when I was out in Scottsdale not last year but a year
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.360]   ago now.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.360]   Those surprised me.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.520]   They don't just have the lidar on top.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.560]   They have it on both sides and the front and the back I think.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:08.640]   I mean those are not cheap sensors and they've got at least four if not five on every one
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.880]   of these specific minivans.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.880]   Wow.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.560]   They got Google money.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.880]   They got alphabet money.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.120]   5G is apparently on the horizon.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:26.400]   I don't know if you knew but the Qualcomm event it was Qualcomm Snapdragon technology summit
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.000]   happened or is happening right now in Hawaii but there was a big kind of announcement yesterday
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.560]   where they unveiled the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.600]   So this is going to be the processor that all of your top of the line Android devices
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:47.000]   over the course of the next year will be stocked with.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.480]   So expect to see this on all of the including probably next year's Pixel devices and everything.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:55.600]   This is going to be the chipset for the next year that you're going to want in your phone
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.240]   if you're buying premium and it has features like a multi-core AI engine.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:04.680]   They say three times the improved AI performance.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.160]   Specialization around enhanced computational photography.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:11.960]   Obviously photography on high-end cameras especially in smartphones is a really big deal
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.320]   and there's so much of that computational stuff happening nowadays.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.880]   So there's going to be part of the silicon devoted to that.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.640]   Optimized for gaming.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:28.720]   Also news about 3D sonic sensors for in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensors that'll work
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.160]   even through like dirty displays and stuff like that.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.160]   Which is cool.
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:39.240]   Because I mean I might be in ultrasonic sensors are actually relatively cheap.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.880]   They're used in all kinds of like I have once researched ultrasonic sensors and they're
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.520]   used all over the place and they're pretty cheap and kind of a good use case.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:54.080]   The challenge I think will be I'm curious how it will work with dirty hands.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.960]   Because what it's doing is measuring the distance in your fingerprint morals.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:02.280]   So I'm like oh if that's if that changes because your hands are a little dirty what does that
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.280]   do?
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.200]   That would be the test I would be performing.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:07.440]   Get your hands super dirty.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.400]   Put your hands in a mud bottle.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400]   Just a little grit.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.400]   Run a little grit across your finger pad and see what happens.
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:21.240]   But yeah so that's we can expect more devices having those kinds of features next year.
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:26.840]   Including apparently a Samsung device of some sort Samsung Verizon announced plans to release
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:31.080]   one of the first 5G phones in the first half of 2019.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.400]   They're all kind of getting on the record at this point saying oh we've got one too.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.400]   We've got one too.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.680]   We're not going to miss the 5G train.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:44.720]   They showed off a concept of the device I believe at the tech summit.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720]   Or at least they plan to.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:52.800]   I'm not sure if the device that I saw during yesterday's was the Samsung device specifically.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.440]   And apparently this phone that's going to be released is not necessarily going to be
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.000]   the Galaxy S10.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.120]   So if you're assuming that the S10 is going to have 5G capability that might be off the
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.120]   mark.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:09.120]   So there we go.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.120]   What else to add on that one?
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.120]   Anybody excited about 5G?
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:18.200]   I feel like there's a lot of they're trying to drum up a lot of excitement around 5G.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.040]   I don't know where it's leading for anyone.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.840]   Too early to be excited I think.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.800]   I don't think on a handset you're going to care.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.720]   I think there's some interesting use cases that we're not talking about.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:33.320]   So I think like for for mobile broadband you're basically it's more capacity.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.960]   So yay in the lower latency that's not we shouldn't scoff at that.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.120]   But I'm not sure we have the apps yet for that that are going to be on your handset.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:47.320]   What's cool is if you guys really want this do you want me to keep going or not.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.320]   Go check.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.320]   Yeah, do it.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.320]   Okay.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320]   I was like I was feel we're nerding out about things.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320]   Get there.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.320]   Okay.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.880]   So on the fixed side we're going to see it you'll be able like Verizon's doing this actually
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:05.040]   you're going to see more broadband services to places that are faster based on this.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.040]   So that's exciting.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:10.720]   It'll be 5G and it'll be over some of the new millimeter wave spectrum that the FCC is
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.800]   auctioning off.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:16.640]   But it's also AT&T has talked about plans to use spectrum that's currently using for
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.800]   like 3G.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:23.920]   So you're going to see not you're going to see 5G over not 5G spectrum is the best way
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:24.920]   to think about that.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.720]   And then the other thing is you're going to have network slicing.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:32.840]   So you're going to be able to dedicate certain chunks of network capacity for like autonomous
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:38.040]   cars or for medical devices and you're going to be able to do that a lot more easily and
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.520]   flexibly than you have in the past.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.800]   So if you think about it carrier like if you have a fleet of autonomous trucks coming
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.680]   across the border or something and dropping on your network you can automatically say
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.200]   oh crap those guys totally can't lose their connection.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.720]   Let's give them this slice and you can do it almost in real time and that's going to
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:02.320]   be really interesting and I don't know what that's going to do for carriers business models.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.360]   So that's one of the big questions I'm asking.
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:12.920]   I'll let you know why and I wanted hotel Wi-Fi.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:16.120]   No one wants good hotel Wi-Fi.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.120]   You're out of touch.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.520]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.720]   I want to get rid of hotel Wi-Fi like right now.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.160]   Yeah, I understand.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.760]   Well then we will that remains to be seen if I get.
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.240]   Oh wait, did we have to do the Chrome log change?
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.680]   Oh, we forgot that.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680]   We forgot that.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:34.680]   Let's do that real quick.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.760]   Thank you for the reminder.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.680]   It's time for the Google change log.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.640]   Dang, I almost forgot.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.520]   Thanks for keeping me on task.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.520]   Let's see here.
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:50.200]   Google plays best of 2018 list has been unveiled.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:55.240]   If you're wondering what the fan favorites for game app movie, a whole bunch of other
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:30:00.080]   things or you can head over to the list and check it out.
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:06.360]   But in case you were wondering the fan favorite game, PubG Mobile, fan favorite app YouTube
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:07.360]   TV.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.120]   I feel like there's some shenanigans going on there maybe.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.120]   This is a Google list.
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.120]   YouTube TV.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.120]   I don't know.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:13.120]   YouTube TV is pretty cool.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.120]   I'll be honest.
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:20.840]   Favorite movie Avengers Infinity War, best app of 2018 drops.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.840]   Learn 31 new languages.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.680]   I've never heard of that app until just now.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.680]   But apparently it's a really great app and a whole lot more.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:33.440]   So you can check that out and find some new apps to install or new movies to watch.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:38.320]   Google virtualized a museum in the Google arts and culture app.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:43.920]   Apparently it allows you to get up close and personal with Johannes Vermeer's works of
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:44.920]   art.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:51.880]   All of Vermeer's works of art, you may remember the best known piece, which is Girl with the
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.240]   Pearl Earring.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.760]   This is an AR kind of museum.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:00.320]   So everything is scaled appropriately according to all the other art and you can kind of explore
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:03.120]   it through the magic of AR.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:04.440]   And apparently it's really cool.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:10.200]   I've not checked it out yet on my own, but I have heard that it is Nito.
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:15.600]   Let's see here, Google worked with Adaptive Design Association to host a 48-hour hackathon
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.880]   for prototyping games that focus on Morse code.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:23.920]   And this was a way to reach kids with physical disabilities all about teaching Morse code
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:24.920]   to them.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:30.120]   So games were designed that utilize the Gboard Morse keyboard.
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:35.440]   So games like an H synth that played musical notes with the Morse keyboard and a game called
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.360]   Morse Striker, which is a soccer spy game and a whole bunch of others.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:45.360]   Google, of course, posted the games on its experiments with Google site and there are
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.000]   open source examples of the code as well.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:56.680]   It's all about improving the capabilities through Morse code for physical disabilities.
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.120]   New Google Home Mini, a new color anyway.
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.360]   It's not a new model, but a new color.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:05.080]   And it very, very Tiffany's inspired.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.240]   What is this, Aqua?
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.920]   I think that would be the Aqua Google Home Mini.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:10.920]   It's very colorful.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:11.920]   That is Aqua.
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:15.320]   If that's your jam, then go ahead and put that in your living room or I don't know where
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.560]   that goes, but there's--
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.560]   It is beachy.
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.560]   Very what?
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.560]   Beachy?
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.560]   Yes.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.560]   Beachy.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.560]   That, and I think there's also the coral color.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:28.840]   So they're going for some really nice color options, sharp color options.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:34.040]   New features coming to smart displays, Lenovo Smart Display, really any smart display that's
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.040]   running Google Assistant software.
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:41.640]   My cookbook feature, touch alarms and quick settings, Nest Hello to a Talk.
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:46.840]   You can remove favorite and share photos through the interface and a whole lot more.
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:51.800]   So if you have one of those, which I do not, I couldn't get over the fact that you can't
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.560]   disable YouTube on them.
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:58.080]   And it's just-- that's a deal breaker for me, unfortunately.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:01.640]   Hopefully one of these days they'll roll that update out.
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.840]   Google uploaded an app called Pixel Sounds to the Play Store.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:06.960]   I don't know if it's up again.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.160]   They had put it there and then it was removed and anyone that downloaded it really didn't
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.520]   get much functionality out of it.
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.760]   So it seemed like one of those server side kind of activation things.
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:19.400]   But apparently it's going to be an app where you can manage your alarms, your ringtones,
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.840]   your notifications.
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:28.000]   And it will kind of integrate itself with the sounds menu settings on the Pixel phone
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.240]   with new options and features.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.240]   Oh my God.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.960]   So I have to have an app to manage my sounds.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.120]   That's terrible.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.480]   I know.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.640]   I'm old and cranky.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:37.320]   That sucks.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.960]   OK, go on.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.920]   I tend to agree.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:40.920]   Have some gin.
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:41.920]   Yes.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:46.680]   The solution is in a bottle for you right now.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:47.840]   15-- yeah, to the bottom.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.160]   15 years strong.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:54.160]   Google released Santa's Village, the Christmas themed site with the Google Santa tracker that
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:55.880]   I know I use every year with my kids.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.360]   They love it.
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.240]   There's a bunch of educational games, lesson plans, instructional videos.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.280]   Of course, the Santa tracker.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:07.040]   You can also ask Google Home where Santa and it'll let you know.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:12.040]   Although I remember last year my kids were doing it for like a month after Christmas because
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.920]   it was still giving the same kind of canned answers afterwards.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:18.120]   They were like, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:21.800]   In Gboard, apparently there's holiday stickers and stuff that you can use as well.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:30.320]   And then finally, Kevin, you wrote about support for virtual desktops and what else?
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.320]   Requesting mobile website on Chrome OS?
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.320]   Coming soon.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.840]   So that's one thing that's definitely lacking on Chrome OS that every other desktop platform
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:43.320]   has is virtual desktops or spaces or whatever you want to call them where you can put different
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:48.960]   apps on virtual displays, so to speak, and slide over to a different desktop for maybe
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:52.320]   productivity and another one for personal, etc.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.640]   So that's in the works.
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:58.080]   I found some code for that also.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:02.400]   And this I think will apply more to smaller Chrome OS tablets of which there's only one
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.600]   right now, the Acer Chromebook Tab 10.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:12.160]   You will be able to request the mobile view of a website on a Chrome OS tablet, which is
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:17.440]   kind of the opposite of the iOS version where you can request the desktop site.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:23.080]   My theory though is, and I wrote it in here, the smaller the display size, the less value
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.040]   you get from a full desktop browser.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.040]   So it makes sense on a smaller device, in my opinion, like the Chromebook Tab 10.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:35.440]   I don't think I'd use the mobile sites on, say, the Pixel Slate, for example, but you'll
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.680]   be able to.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.680]   Nice.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:43.800]   And that is the Google change log.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.240]   I love that that's a feature.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.640]   That's a feature of the show again.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.640]   That was sad when it disappeared.
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:48.640]   It's good to have it back.
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:53.040]   I guess it's been back for a long time now at this point, but there you go.
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.440]   Let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode.
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.160]   Sorry, I just got a notification.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:03.720]   Uh, and then everyone grabs their phone.
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:05.520]   Was that a B?
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.520]   No.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:10.480]   Uh, we'll take a break and thank the sponsor and then we'll come back with tips, tricks,
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:13.000]   numbers, all that fun stuff this week.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.640]   And Google is brought to you by DigitalOcean, developers watching the show.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:18.640]   Listen up.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:24.280]   DigitalOcean provides the easiest cloud platform to deploy, manage and scale applications with
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:29.880]   droplets, virtual machines that are a scalable compute platform with add-on storage, security
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.600]   and monitoring capabilities.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.520]   And you can choose, there's just a number of options.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.600]   You can choose from standard or CPU optimized droplets.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.360]   And then starting there, you can customize outward.
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.560]   DigitalOcean is designed for developers.
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:50.200]   It's got an easy to use control panel and an API that lets developers spend more time
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:54.480]   coding and less time managing their infrastructure.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.120]   Industry leading price to performance, you can access the compute resources that you
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.440]   need at the lowest rates.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:05.600]   That's going to save up to 55% compared to other cloud providers.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.720]   And you're always going to know what you'll pay per month.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:12.960]   Let's have that information right up front with a flat pricing structure across all data
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.200]   center regions so there's no surprises.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:22.560]   Included at no additional cost, in a number of things you get 99.99% uptime SLA, cloud
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:29.240]   firewalls, monitoring and alerting, full DNS management, global data centers of course,
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.520]   enterprise SSDs and an easy to use API.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:39.240]   For 150,000 businesses including some of the world's fastest growing startups, rely on
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:43.840]   DigitalOcean and that's to remove their infrastructure friction and deliver industry leading price
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.840]   performance.

[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.640]   All right, rounding out the show here.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:13.320]   Let's start with you, Kevin, because I see something in the doc for you.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.320]   What you got?
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.320]   What's your stuff?
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:21.480]   So you Jason may have actually come across this with all about Android, but for others
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.360]   who may not be aware.
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:29.000]   And since we talked about security so much today, I wanted to point out the e foundation,
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:39.560]   which is another mobile platform play basically using the lineage OS version of Android.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:42.800]   You can install this on a bunch of different devices right now.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:45.680]   It's really in the early testing phases.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.120]   And the whole idea is you will have total control over your privacy.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:56.000]   You will not be giving the foundation or anyone else any at makers your information.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.200]   I have not tried this yet.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.320]   I'd like to find one of my old phones that will work with it, but none of them do just
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.360]   yet.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:11.600]   But the idea again is for privacy based privacy based experience, they are looking to start
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:17.080]   selling phones with this operating system in about a month.
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:18.640]   So I wonder if they're going to be at CES.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:19.640]   They see I will be there.
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:23.320]   I don't know if anybody else on the show will be there, but I will actually stop by if they're
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.360]   there because I'm very interested in this approach.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:32.240]   I think it's tough to have a third or alternative mobile platform right now, but a lot of people
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.760]   are, you know, have privacy on their minds and as well they should.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.920]   So the foundation is something that you can try and look into if that's something that
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:42.240]   appeals to you.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.240]   Very cool.
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:44.240]   I like that.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.240]   I'll have to check that out.
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.240]   Looking to that a little bit more.
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:49.800]   I'm sure I have a device somewhere that I can test that out on.
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.800]   Let's see here.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:53.000]   Stacey, what you got?
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.080]   I, let's see, what do I have?
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:57.240]   I have.
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:01.600]   I could take you on the road and show it to you, but here's a lovely picture on the website
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:02.840]   that I put in there.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:08.640]   This is the, it has the longest name, but it is a smoke detector that also detects carbon
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:16.160]   monoxide, acts as a speaker and has Apple HomeKit and Amazon's Madam A.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:19.480]   So it sounds amazing.
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:22.760]   It is $250, which is crazy expensive.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:27.960]   So this is not for everyone, but if you are the type of person who does not want a bunch
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:33.720]   of echoes or whatnots running around your house and you wanted to play Apple Music,
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:39.680]   although the Amazon echoes will start getting that on their own, this device will have this
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:42.520]   and it sounds amazing.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:46.840]   It's got a little night light that you can change, like be purple or blue.
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:51.240]   You can make phone calls on it using Madam A.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:55.200]   And you know, I think it's, it's a nice device.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:59.080]   It's not for everybody, but if you're going to upgrade your smoke detectors, it also sends
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.480]   you an alert when your smoke detector goes off.
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:06.520]   You could have one of these with your, I have, this is a first alert, but I have kitty smoke
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:11.080]   detectors in my house and this works and sets off the network smoke detectors.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:16.720]   I don't know what else to tell you about it, but it's actually a, it's a surprisingly
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.720]   good product.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:22.880]   At first, I thought it was really gimmicky when I read about it, but having tried it,
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:24.480]   I would actually put this in my house.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.480]   It is expensive.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:28.080]   So it's not for everyone, but.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.080]   Nice.
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:35.280]   I, I, although taking calls from like, I have to wonder how the call is going to stop the
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.280]   other end.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.280]   No, I can get.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.000]   So well, and I'm going to test that with Kevin actually.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.720]   Hey, Kevin, stick around after the show because I need to call you on my smoke detector.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:46.320]   Oh, can't hear you.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.320]   You're muted.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.920]   Kevin and you're muted.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:53.040]   Sorry, I was talking to the dog.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.240]   Let's hope there's no fire issues when you give me a call on that because I don't know
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.320]   what would happen to the phone call, you know.
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.760]   Oh, we could set off the smoke detector.
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:02.760]   Wow.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.360]   I think you have to test it out.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:08.960]   Put it, yeah, put it through its paces, light a fire so that it's, so that it's, so
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.880]   that it's the, that the alarm starts going off and then make the call while the alarm's
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:12.880]   going off.
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.880]   Oh, I was thinking I would like the fire while I was talking with Kevin.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.080]   Oh, I guess you could test it before and after to that way.
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.600]   You know, that that covers all the bases.
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:21.600]   Totally.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.600]   Good plan.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.760]   Jeff, what's your number?
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.200]   So I'm hoping because Stacy had a meeting with a Bose person, maybe she knows more about
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:34.680]   this than I do, but I'm fascinated by the Bose AR headset classes coming out, especially
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:39.640]   because we talked a few weeks ago about how his audio AR and how I believe this ought
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:42.440]   to be used for people with limited sight.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:45.840]   And so if the glasses, no where you are and where you're headed, what could they give
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:49.040]   you an audio sounds really interesting to me.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.400]   AT&T actually has a pair of glasses called ARIA glasses that do that already and they
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.160]   have haptic feedback in them.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.080]   So it vibrates to which way you go.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.080]   I'm not saying they're way expensive and come with an AT&T subscription.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.080]   So this is probably a cheaper, better option.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.400]   This is 200 bucks and available for preorder.
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.400]   Yes.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.440]   So the idea of playing with audio AR audio is a different input smart to where you are.
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:16.280]   If it's working in the home and it's talking to you and your smoke detector and all that,
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:18.840]   why shouldn't it work out on the street meters walking around?
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:23.320]   And also obviously you can ask Madamay, you can ask Mr. G and so on questions and get
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:24.320]   answers.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:27.880]   The story says that it's not an ear plug.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:28.840]   It's a small speaker.
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:36.440]   So you don't want to ask for when is your rendezvous with your lover on the phone because
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:39.200]   other people can hear you.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:40.200]   That's okay.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.200]   Okay.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:44.680]   I mean, good reputation.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:48.480]   I mean, then people will be like, wow, she's really amazing.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.480]   Wow.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480]   Okay.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.040]   And where did she get those glasses?
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.040]   Exactly.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.040]   It's amazing.
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:56.120]   She got a lever with those glasses.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:59.080]   They're pretty dorky looking, but that's great.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:06.440]   So I will tell you one tidbit from my, the interview I had with the Bose lady is everybody.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.280]   I guess this makes sense, right?
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:13.280]   But because everybody's ear canal and outside of their ear is differently shaped, we actually
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.520]   have, we all hear things differently.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:20.600]   We don't think about it, but we all have a different perception of what we hear.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:26.280]   And what she was talking about is how that experience gets flattened a lot of time in
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:32.560]   earphones, which subtly changes how each of us hears everything through earphones, which
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.800]   I was just like.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:36.360]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.480]   She was really fun to talk to.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:47.720]   I mean, as far as dorky looking AR glasses are concerned, these aren't bad.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.480]   They're a part of the glass.
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:51.520]   The sides of the barbells.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:58.800]   I'll, I'll confess to you that my non connected sunglasses without anything in them were more
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:01.160]   expensive than these sunglasses.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:06.320]   And yeah, they look better, but that's just my opinion.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.320]   These are Bose.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:16.840]   So you remember back at Google, I.O. Google had said about its home devices that they
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:23.720]   would add a pretty please feature for speaking nicely to your devices and being rewarded
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:24.720]   for it.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:26.440]   Apparently that is rolling out now.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:31.360]   So if you say please, when you ask a question, you'll get responses tailored to it.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.520]   Things like, thanks for asking so nicely.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:41.160]   Now never hurts to start treating our devices with respect and kindness.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:43.080]   And also teaching our kids to do that.
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.840]   Maybe it's a good practice for them as well.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:51.280]   Some other features include list integration that now includes third party apps like Keep,
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:55.400]   the way it used to before they changed it and it started to suck really bad.
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:59.200]   Also any do bring and to do is integration.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.200]   So you can set that up.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:06.200]   Yay for that.
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:07.200]   A broadcast replies is rolling out which basically makes these devices more of like a two way communication
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:08.200]   thing.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.200]   I'm curious to test that out.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.200]   I want to see how that works.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.320]   I'm a little confused on that.
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:16.120]   And then lyric support for screen assistant devices.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:19.880]   Although apparently right now that only works with Google Play music, which as we know Google
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:25.320]   Play music is being phased out in lieu of YouTube music and YouTube music really sucks.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:28.440]   So I'm not very happy about that.
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:30.440]   We're going to come out with Hangouts music next.
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:31.440]   Yes.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.440]   Hangouts music.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.560]   Don't ruin it.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:37.800]   Jason's things into very strong opinions.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:38.800]   Yes.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.320]   Sorry, I had to put that in there.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.880]   No, no, I appreciate it.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.880]   They're data points.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.680]   They have to be mentioned.
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.400]   And we have reached the end of this week in Google this episode anyways, not the whole
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:50.400]   show.
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.040]   But this week's episode has come to a close.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.280]   And thank you once again for inviting me on you guys.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.600]   I love doing the show with you.
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.040]   And it's always a lot of fun.
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:01.120]   Kevin Tofel, thanks for dropping in today.
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:03.720]   Where do you want people to follow all of your amazing work online?
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.200]   I assume about Chromebooks.com.
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:08.600]   That's what, yeah, I hear that's a pretty good site.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.400]   So I would hit that.
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:11.400]   My Bible.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:12.400]   I love it.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:13.400]   Thank you.
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:15.040]   I'm glad to hear that.
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:16.040]   Seriously.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:17.040]   Kevin C.
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:22.760]   It's not as good as Gutenberg's Bible, but it's Jeff's book.
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:23.760]   Close second.
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:25.240]   Close second.
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:28.200]   Jeff, thanks for making it.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:32.040]   Even France couldn't keep you from being connected to us.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.040]   So thank you.
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.040]   Go tell what.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.040]   So, bon lui.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.040]   Hey, it worked, man.
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:38.560]   It's not the sharpest connection in the world, but it was stable.
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:42.160]   I got to say it was very stable.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:45.280]   Buzzmachine.com and a whole lot else.
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:46.800]   Anything you want to add?
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:47.800]   Jeff Jarvis on Twitter?
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:48.800]   I'm going to the band.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:49.800]   All right.
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:50.800]   It's time for bed, Jeff.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:51.800]   Tuck yourself in.
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:52.800]   On the way.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:53.800]   Want to meet?
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.200]   And Stacy Higginbotham, always so much fun to do a show with you.
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:03.240]   IOTpodcast.com, Stacy on IOT.com, and @gigastacy on Twitter.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.240]   Thank you.
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:05.440]   And I didn't make my goal.
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:07.000]   I only had two things at Gens.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000]   Sorry, you guys.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000]   So you did two bottles?
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.800]   Yeah, but there's only one ounce.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.800]   So I did two ounces.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:12.800]   Okay.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.800]   All right.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:14.800]   Well, you know what?
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.600]   Just do that the next couple of days and you're caught up.
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:17.600]   Yes.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:18.600]   That'll be my...
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:19.600]   Hold on, guys.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:20.600]   I need to drink.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:21.600]   Hold on.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.600]   Yes.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:23.600]   I got a calendar reminder.
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.920]   I need to do something really important.
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:27.920]   Let's see here.
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:33.480]   We do this show every Wednesday, I believe, at 1.30...
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:34.480]   1.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:37.600]   1.30 pm Pacific, 4.00, 4.30 pm Eastern.
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.440]   Somewhere around there today we started a little bit earlier and I really appreciate
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.440]   it.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:42.440]   Thank you, Carson, for setting that up.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:45.960]   It helps me out for this day in particular, but we do it live.
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:46.960]   So you can watch it live.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:52.000]   If you go to twit.tv/live, you can watch as we record the show live or you can subscribe
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:58.640]   to it, of course, twit.tv/twig is where you can go and you can find...
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:01.960]   Oh, that's a new header image that I had not seen yet.
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.680]   And all the episodes are listed there.
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:06.720]   Subscribe information is there so you can subscribe and you don't even have to think
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:07.720]   about it.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:10.160]   It just appears on your phone like magic.
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:11.160]   It's amazing.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:16.320]   Twit.tv/twig and I think that's about it.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.320]   We've reached the end.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.320]   I'm Jason Howell.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:21.080]   Thanks for joining us for another episode of This Week in Google.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.080]   We'll see you next week.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:22.360]   Bye, buddy.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:31.800]   [Music]
