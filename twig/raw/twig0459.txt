[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Stacey Higginbotham is here.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.900]   We're also joined by Joan Donovan from Data and Society.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.100]   We're going to talk about VPN filter that botnet that the Russians created.
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.100]   What might they be up to and why you should reboot your router.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.500]   Mary Mieker's state of the Internet slideshow.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.900]   We'll discuss each and every one of all her 294 slides.
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.600]   No, I promise we won't.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.400]   And targeting Shack.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.600]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.100]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.100]   From people you trust.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.600]   This is Twig.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   This is Twig.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.600]   This week in Google, Episode 459, recorded Wednesday, May 30, 2018.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.600]   Status Update, Terror.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.600]   This week at Google is brought to you by Trace Pontus, freshly roasted.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600]   Gourmet coffee shipped directly to you.

[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Google's show we cover...
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   whatever the heck we want to cover.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.600]   Sometimes Google, usually a little Google thrown in, but thanks to Stacey Higginbotham, a lot of IoT stuff.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.600]   Stacey on IoT.com.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   Hi Stacey, welcome back. We missed you.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   Hello.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   I am happy to be here.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600]   But now that you're here, Jeff's gone.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   So you can't win.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   You can't win.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   But the good news is we've replaced Jeff with somebody even more wonderful.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   Joan Donovan is here.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   We always like to get Joan on.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   She is a researcher at dataandsociety.net.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   Her official area is medium manipulation.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   Love it.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   Yep.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   Hi Joan.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   Business is booming.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   Business is good.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   Yep.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   Every day.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   You actually have a good article that came out earlier this year.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   I guess this is one of your reports on algorithmic accountability.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   It's funny because I've just, this morning was thinking about the problem with the algorithm.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   We were talking about how, gosh darn it, they ruined Instagram because it's no longer chronological.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   It's algorithmic.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   And then I think it was Anthony Nelson, one of our producers who said, well the real problem is companies now optimize for engagement,
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   optimize for time spent, not optimize for user happiness.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   They're not trying to make users happy.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   They're just trying to optimize for time spent.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   We were talking about how YouTube now, if you subscribe, the subscriptions are all broken.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   You can't, you know, you go to your YouTube subscription, you don't get notifications.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Your subscriptions, part of them are in the subscription list.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Some of them aren't.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   Mostly it's recommendations.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's all algorithmic.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   Yeah, I think when we were writing that, we were very concerned with more even proprietary algorithms.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   So how do companies learn to sort something as simple as job applications?
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   One company we found had been optimizing for location.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   And as a result, their hiring pool became extremely homogeneous because they were in a very white neighborhood.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   And so they didn't realize that even by optimizing for something as simple as short commutes was going to have this really broad effect on the kinds of people that then got selected out.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   Right?
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   So it's even...
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   Kathy O'Neill's been talking a lot about this.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   Exactly.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   Yeah, and she's someone that we look to quite a bit for advising on that report.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   And as far as the Instagram thing, I really miss having a chronological feed because it's just, you know, you know, we're...
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   Well, I mean, I'm going to out myself as sort of someone who enjoys surveillance, right?
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   But you know where people are and you know what they're doing and you can say, "Oh!"
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   Instagram is made for stalking.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   Of course it is.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   Yeah, you know, I mean, but it's like...
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   But not stalking.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   So if someone's birthday party, you know, from three days later, and I look like, you know, I wasn't paying any attention because I didn't see their post, you know, but it's just that it didn't optimize for that.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   And as a result, I, you know, I look like someone who's really behind the times when I comment.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   So certainly the first thing you talked about is much more important in the long run.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   How we're letting big data make a kind of unconsciously make decisions often within proper or incorrect or just even thought about algorithms.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   And that's certainly bad.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   But it's related.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   It's the same.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   It's a sort of a religious faith in the algorithm that is not as ill-founded.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   And I'm starting to think AI shouldn't stand for artificial intelligence.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.600]   It's just stand for algorithmic idiocy.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   We've had this for...
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   Oh, go ahead, Stacey.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   Go ahead.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   I was going to say I was in a great book out right now called Automating Inequality.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   And yeah, so just to play on the AI turn.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   And that's what Kathy O'Neill, the math babe, talks about in her book, Weapons of Math Destruction.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   How big data increases inequality.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   Go ahead, Dasti.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   We've been doing this for a while.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   We just haven't been doing it quite at the scale.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   And without as much...
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   And across as many products or things that people touch in their day-to-day lives, we've been using data to cherry-picking data forever.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   But when we hand it over to computers, there's so much better at it.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   And they don't have the same social inputs or mores or goals or aspirations even that we have that we don't think to program them with.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   So, of course, I mean, this is going to happen.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   I write about this a lot as it ties to business transformation and industrial internet type things.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   Because companies really have to think about what they're optimizing for.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   Because a lot of times, if you optimize for revenue, you're going to either cut down on your workforce happiness, your product quality.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   And those are things that actually matter.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   Yeah, it's actually dumb.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   It seems like it's the smart thing to do.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   BI, business intelligence, it's a smart thing to do.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.600]   And Jeff Jarvis hates it when I use the term weaponized.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   But that's what we've done. We've weaponized it.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   We've always had it.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.600]   But now we've got so much computation and so much data that we can use it in a deadly way.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   Well, even if the advertising field, they talk about it as targets and waste, right?
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   And that's just like weird ways to bucket people.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   But one of the things that we want...
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   Are you a target or are you waste?
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   Or you waste, right?
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   I wasted my ad spend on you, buddy boy.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   Exactly, right? And you know, conversion into action.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   But one of the things that we found really helpful in that's, which is really just a very broad literature review of that piece.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   But we found those ProPublica studies of Facebook's advertising algorithm to be really, really helpful.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   Because one of the things that ProPublica was able to show is how you can't just...
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   You don't have to just target in. You can also target out different groups.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   And there's certain housing laws, certain non-discrimination places that people were using advertising that it was really clear that they were using racially biased or age biased advertising targeting.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   And so there's other ways of thinking about how the social media platforms do become weaponized in this sense.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   And I think it's really important that we treat them with the same expectations that we would someone placing an ad in a newspaper would at that...
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   You know, with that level of discernment and discretion.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   Yeah, you're talking about the ProPublica study where they complained about Facebook doing this.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   Facebook said we're not going to do it anymore.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   Then ProPublica went back and they still were being able to buy ads on Facebook that targeted whites.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   Yeah, they had changed like categories from, you know, to, I think they're now called multicultural affinity categories.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   But if you actually look at your own, one thing that I always point out is I am categorized as African American according to Facebook's racial programming.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   And I think it has something to do with the kinds of friends that I have, the kinds of stories that you're sharing.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   It's your likes. Your likes give you away.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   We saw that Cambridge Analytica was basing its work on a study that showed that they can determine your gender, your race, your sexual orientation,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   from, you know, give me 52 likes and I can tell you you're black, except you're not.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   No, I'm not. I'm often a man if it makes you feel better, Jim.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   Well, it's probably, you know, the kind of stuff that you study, right?
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:31.600]   Not a lot of women are in the business world in that capacity studying tech.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   But we should really, I mean, I really, I don't understand why companies don't, they think they're being smart.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   They're actually being dumb. And I think they're, you know, they're optimizing.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   They think they're optimizing for engagement or sales or revenue.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   But when it has a consequence that in the long run, doesn't improve any of that, they don't pay attention to it because they say, well, no, we have the algorithms.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   We have the computers. I'm telling you, I'm calling it algorithmic idiocy. That's going to be the name of my book.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   I don't know.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   Yeah, I know, right. Now you've burned it, right?
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   Too late. I gave it away.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   Yeah, it's a hashtag, not a title. It is. It's a hashtag, not a title.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   All right. We could start. We started off because I saw that and I thought that was a great thing that Joan, before coming on said, well, I tried to go through all 294 of Mary Meeker's slides, but I'm afraid I just can't do it.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   Every year, Mary Meeker does her Internet Trends report. She became quite famous for this, didn't she? This was how she got her job at Kleiner.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   Yeah. Well, not solely this. She became famous originally in you are around them. Leo, come on 2000 predicting the top companies that were going to come out of the dot com era.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   She was an analyst at the time.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   Yes, for Morgan's.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   Maybe. Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   So now, of course, she now works for KP, but does the same slide show this time at the code conference, Internet Trends 2018.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   It's always been at the code conference.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.600]   Has it? I mean, not always.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   Well, it would have been re-code.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   Before that, D and all things D.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   2017 was the first year in which smartphone unit shipments did not grow at all.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   Mm.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   Saturation.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   That is what that is. But never fear. They're putting a subscriber's cellular subscriptions in your car in your dog tracking color.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   My oven.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   Maybe they, you know, we're going to be fine. Or rather, the cellular carrier.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   Same goes for Internet user growth.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   Rose 7% in 2017. It was 12% the year before. That means it's slowing.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.600]   But half the world is now online. That was the other interesting number.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   49% of the world of the world's population is now able to get online.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   I don't know what the standard for getting online is, but that was.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   It depends. You know, the FCC for a long time had 512 kilobits per second.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   That was up until like 2010.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   That's a broadband. Let's see what else. There's so many stats here.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.600]   People are increasing the amount of time they spend online.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   US adults spent 5.9 hours a day on digital media in 2017. That's up from 5.6.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   3.3 of the almost six hours, more than half on mobile.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   Yes.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   Indeed. Was there these? There was a lovely slide showing media consumption.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   I think it was like number 11 or 15 very early on.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   And that was eye opening to me just because so much content is being watched on mobile
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.600]   compared to like TV and other things from just a few years ago.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   Daily hours spent. Slide 11. Hey, look at that.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.600]   Good, good, good, good brains. Daily hours spent with digital media per adult user.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   And the green is mobile.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   Why are we spending so much on our phones? Because it's there?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   Instagram, Facebook. Oh. Right?
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   Those are the sticky ones. I bet the big three are Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   I bet. But I don't know.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.600]   You can. There is an option on your phone to look at how long you look at apps.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.600]   It's a built-in feature to both iPhone and Android has it. Yeah.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   Yeah. But it is telling because there is, yeah,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   I mean, we're watching now movies online.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   I know as a New York commuter, it's really easy to download something and listen to it
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   or watch it on the Metro rather than watch some of the other things that happen on the Metro.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   I think you're unusual though. I mean, that's, I don't know.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   Is that a very urban use case? Yeah, I don't know if that's.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   So, I think it's, if you're sitting there, I mean, I'm not, I'm not proud of this.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   But sometimes I would just be so lazy and like maybe my Amazon integration with my television
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   isn't working and I'll just be laying on the couch.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   I'm like, yeah, that's good. I'll just watch it on my phone.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   See, I never, ever watch movies on phone, tablet, or laptop, except if I'm not home.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   Mm-hmm. Oh, every now and then in my daughter actually.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.600]   Yeah, that's the chat room. How many of you at home, you don't, John, you're watching your TV.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   Carson says he'll watch on a tablet.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.600]   You have kids that might be why. Not Chromecast, Pron, because that means you're watching
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.600]   it on the big screen. I don't mean controlling it with your phone.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   I mean, actually looking on your small screen on your mobile.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   Aunt Pruitt says he does it all the time.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   So, I don't know.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   And Aunt just gave me the best information in the chat room explaining that apparently today
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   is national doughnut day. Is that true?
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   Oh, nuts. Don't.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.600]   It was. I missed it.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.600]   No, it is not too late. Are you in a different time zone, Joan? It's not too late.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   I know. I know. Yeah, you're right.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.600]   And I feel live.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   You live in the city that never sleeps, Joan.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   Oh, it's tomorrow.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   We're all okay. It's a week now.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   You know how I find this stuff out?
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   Do you know about this site? I should make this my tip of the week.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   forecastwithakay.com.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.600]   This is a crowdsourced event calendar that does all the days.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.600]   But it also does all the days like the national spelling bee finalist today or tomorrow rather.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   Friday is national.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   Somebody for my daughter's school is going to be in it.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   I'm very excited for them. I get to root for a person.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.600]   I'm very excited.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   Digitation.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   PRES.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   They actually, they're really hard.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   They give you really hard words that you do not.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   Oh, and those kids, man.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   They're amazing. They've memorized them.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   So, not only is Friday national doughnut day, but Kanye's album solo album comes out.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   And hurricane season starts.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.600]   So, this is a great. This is a, I love this because there's a lot of geek stuff on it,
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.600]   but it's crowdsourced.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   So, you know, there's, you know, like tomorrow, SpaceX launch.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.600]   It's also world no tobacco day.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   Mm.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   Mm.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   James Bond novel comes out in the UK, the new James Bond novel.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   See stuff, Expedition 56 launches on June 6th.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   I don't even know what that is.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.600]   Ocean's 8 premieres on June 8th. World Ocean's Day.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.600]   So, yeah, national doughnut day is Friday.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   So, plenty of time, Joe.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.600]   Oh.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.600]   It's in now.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   It just keeps moving.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   We've decided to move it back.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.600]   For those of you who missed it.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   I could celebrate it today, tomorrow and on Friday, actually.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   You get, you get a doughnut free at Dunkin Donuts, by the way.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   So, I don't have Dunkin Donuts.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.600]   Plus, those are terrible donuts.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   No.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.600]   Oh, yes.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   Yes, don't at me, people.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.600]   [laughter]
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   You just made an enemy out of the entire Northeast.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   I don't, yeah, I don't get it myself.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   I grew up in the Northeast.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   I never had a Dunkin Donut.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   They finally put a Dunkin Donut in Petaluma.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   And I had my first Dunkin just a couple of days ago.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   Oh, yes.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   And they aren't good.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   They're not as good as Krispy Kreme.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   Yeah, they're not as good as Krispy Kreme.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   Yeah, if you ate them as a kid, though, it's a nostalgia thing.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.600]   Okay.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.600]   The flavors never change.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   They all have the same texture.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   It's just like what you were saying.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.600]   You know, they like those Italian cookies.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.600]   You get in the tin.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   They all taste exactly the same, but they just have different shapes.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   It's like that.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   [laughter]
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   What is it, the Stella Doro cookies?
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   They all taste exactly the same.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   Oh, those.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.600]   Yes.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.600]   Those are, they're just different.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.600]   And they have the sugar crust on the hook.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600]   Sugar.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.320]   The thing is you'd go with like your dad or something, you know, you get a coffee, you know, or they
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.600]   give you a munchkin or something.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.600]   It's a memory.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.400]   I mean, I wouldn't tell you, you know, IHOP is the best breakfast, but there is a kind
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:03.600]   of nostalgia zone that you can hit, you know, in your traveling, you know.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:09.400]   Actually, new smartphone shipments, it's actually worse than she said on this slide.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.920]   It looks like they've been tumbling for some time.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.760]   If you move into the enterprise, there's a couple noteworthy slides.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   All right.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.760]   Wifi.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.760]   Wifi adoption is rising.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.760]   Look at that.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.760]   I can't believe that we had anywhere to go, but hey, who's, but slide 201.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.680]   So way in there, we're talking about enterprising IT projects, which we'll see the largest
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.120]   spend increase in 2018.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.800]   And this is from last, the beginning of the first quarter of this year, to the beginning
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.200]   of the second quarter of this year, networking equipment, which I thought was really interesting.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.120]   Or even artificial intelligence.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.320]   That's, that was what I was like.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:57.320]   So I'm assuming that is Wifi, like it doesn't really describe what kind of networking equipment.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.600]   Obviously in the data center, you've got so much more network traffic that you've got
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.240]   to manage both East West.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   So within the data center and across it.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.920]   So I wonder if that's happening or if that's like wifi and Bluetooth and other like network
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.480]   expert enterprise networks.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.920]   I'm not sure what that entails.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.560]   So I'm very curious about that slide.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.000]   What is hyper converged infrastructure?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.960]   That is when you mush everything else.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.000]   Storage, networking and compute all into one kind of thing.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.160]   Cisco's had it.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.280]   It's kind of like the answer that a lot of corporate companies offer for cloud.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.680]   And by corporate, I mean like server vendors.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.000]   It's kind of the last vestige of their profit markets.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.400]   There's Moore's Law at work.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.880]   $1,000 worth of computer equipment from the analyst.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.120]   It goes way back to the analytical engine in 1900.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.880]   But we should probably start looking around 1975, which is about the middle of the chart.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.720]   But it is, it is not, it is interestingly not exponential as one would expect with Moore's
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   law.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.920]   It's linear, but it's definitely a steep, steep curve.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.720]   How many calculations per second for $1,000 worth of computer equipment?
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.040]   And this is the other one, the storage price versus hard drive capacity.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.040]   Wow.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.960]   That's an even steeper downward curve.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   Wow.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.360]   My first computer had 256.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.360]   Yep.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   Megs.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.360]   Megs.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.360]   Not gigs kids.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.360]   Not gigs.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.360]   Not gigs.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   I remember buying like, was it?
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:34.720]   A Pentium had 400 megahertz of processing power?
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   Maybe was.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   Okay.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   Cause I remember.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   No, the early Pentiums were 90 megahertz.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   Okay.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   It was a slightly fast one.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.920]   My dad and I built a computer and we built several.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.960]   You go to Dunkin Donuts afterwards.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.560]   We did not, we went to Shipley's because we're in the south.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.560]   Oh, Shipley's.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   Yep.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.400]   But I've switched, I've since switched my donut loyalty to Krispy Kreme.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.640]   Because they're lighter and fluffier and Shipley's are a little heavy.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.640]   I will eat them though.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.640]   They're going to kill us.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.680]   They're going to kiss worse than not liking Chipotle.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.960]   There's not Jeff here to arbitrate, you know.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.400]   Yeah, we need, we need Jeff for this.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.600]   We would defend one of those to the death.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.920]   I know we would.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.680]   There's so many slides.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.680]   It's fun to look at, but it's kind of overwhelming.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.800]   So some other interesting slides.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.600]   I'll offer you a little bit.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.520]   You've already extracted the information.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.720]   You're so good.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.680]   It talks about consumer data sharing.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.120]   So starting on 205, I was actually kind of surprised that almost 80% of us are willing
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.800]   to share our personal data for benefits.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.600]   Doesn't surprise me.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.760]   Okay.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:49.000]   But then it talks, this I feel is Mary Meeker being a little bit in the Silicon Valley bubble.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.880]   But she makes it sound like we're actually taking a lot of action to protect our data.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:00.440]   I can see this kind of chart being used to self-regulate in a highly ineffective way.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:06.320]   But talking about making consumer privacy tools more accessible, I don't agree with all
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.880]   of this really.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:15.800]   She says 64% of the respondents to this is to a Deloitte and Tush survey said they had
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.280]   deleted or avoided certain apps to protect privacy.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.960]   I think they're just Deloitte now.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   Oh, there's no Tush?
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   They got rid of the Tush.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.120]   That would have been a while.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.400]   Really dating myself on that one.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:35.000]   You know, back when the Edison Lightbulb company was in charge, things were better.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.280]   28% of disabled cookies as if that does anything at all.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.920]   27% didn't visit or close certain websites.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.120]   26%.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.920]   This is a complete lie from the respondents.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.520]   26% say, oh, yeah, I closely read privacy agreements.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520]   No way.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.960]   I'm still reading my GDPR agreements.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.960]   And I'm tired.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   Fire!
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.960]   Fire!
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.680]   That's why you can't trust surveys for stuff like this.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.680]   You really can't.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.520]   Well, here you want to survey?
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.400]   This is going to get us off Mary Meeker for a minute.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.040]   So I can bring us back though if we need to.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.480]   How many people of or you guys did you reboot your router?
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   Yes.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.920]   Because I do it every day and he's like, yes, there are those people.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.400]   So the FBI, we've been talking about this a lot.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.600]   VPN filter is a malware created by FancyBear.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.920]   You may remember them from the hack of the DNC some years ago.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.360]   They have infected.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:41.960]   The FBI estimates half a million consumer routers made by Linksys Netgear TP Link MicroTIC with
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.280]   this VPN filter.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:49.240]   And the FBI this week said everybody should reboot because now they had a way you couldn't
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.400]   reboot before because it would be rebooting would just reload the malware.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.720]   But the FBI thinks that they stopped that because they shut down the photo bucket images
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:05.400]   that were one way the malware was reloading and they also shut down a website to knowall.com.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.240]   But Steve Gibson has looked a little deeper into the Cisco analysis of VPN filter.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.720]   He said even if you reboot your router, your router is still beakening to the malware
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.480]   servers.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.480]   So this is the Talos, not Cisco, the Talos report.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:30.280]   So he says the geeks amongst us would do best to rewrite their firmware.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.280]   No, reset.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.280]   Dude.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.280]   That is art force.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.280]   A reset will not do it.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.400]   You have to, well, it's not that hardcore because most routers, you know, you can download
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.080]   an update firmware.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.800]   If you don't update it, actually I updated if you can.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:51.240]   But if you can't update it, just reinstall the existing firmware will overwrite the malware,
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.080]   the little stub of the malware that loaded in all the other stuff.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.520]   So even though, see the FBI's advice was probably appropriate given the audience because it
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.760]   certainly took those routers off the botnet, but they are still beakening.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.960]   And it's not clear that that means they've been that they're no longer at risk.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.160]   It might be that there's another method that fancy bears figured out for getting the malware
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.600]   on the routers again.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:20.120]   So best thing to do would be get a weight of all traces of VPN filter and to do that
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.120]   you need to overwrite your firmware.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.560]   Can I ask you a super technical question?
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.560]   Sure.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.560]   Okay.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.560]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:34.360]   If you, so I run, I bridge my Euro routers and my cable to my cable modem, right?
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.160]   So my router is the Euro.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.400]   My modem though also could act as a router, it just doesn't.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.600]   So in my case, am I safe?
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.680]   No, your modem, your cable modem has a router in it.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.680]   Right.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.240]   So it doesn't, it's not the routing that's doing the bad stuff.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.760]   It's merely using that router as a computer that can be joined on the botnet.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:01.800]   So even if you've disabled the routing features of that router, it can still be misused with
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.040]   VPN filter.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.560]   So and if you're not, even if you're not on the affected router list, you should, everybody
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.880]   should probably just reboot.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.880]   It's harmless.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.960]   It just takes you off the internet for a minute or two as you reap, as you go back.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.960]   Harmless.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   Good Lord.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.960]   Mostly.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.480]   Well, most of us have our routers like shoved behind a cable box and underneath a kitchen
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   table.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.840]   It's like, oh, that's a terrible place for your router.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.160]   It can't be right now.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   That's just it.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.560]   This is a New York apartment.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.560]   It's very small.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.000]   It is what it is.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   It is what it is.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And it works.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.800]   If I can get the Wi-Fi throughout the apartment, that's what matters.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:44.160]   I was going to say when I lived in LA, we would often, I was working at the Institute
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.960]   for Society and Genetics and we had a few techy type people and we would come up with
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:55.520]   screenplays, best case, like worst case dystopian scenarios about how we would, this was when
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.560]   Malcolm Nance's book came out the plot to Hack America and we would often talk about
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.560]   what we would do.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.760]   And it was like the router attack.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.200]   The movie would be called Status Update Terror.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.640]   The people were all the routers.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:15.160]   And then on a single day, it would like update everybody's social media status, some kind
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.520]   of horrible thing, like go outside, your job, you know, your job is canceled.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.520]   I don't know.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:27.200]   But yeah, this was the germ of my idea, which was that the best, like if you were really
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:34.880]   going to take over the router is the most poorly understood piece of technical infrastructure
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.240]   that is also in everybody's home and necessary.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:44.360]   And then when I moved to New York, I saw all of these Wi-Fi stations, these link systems,
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.760]   and I just thought, oh, it's bound to happen, you know, because it's like the public infrastructure
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:58.960]   Wi-Fi just seems to be, you know, such an easy space to think about, like, if you were
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.200]   going to do something crazy.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.960]   Well, Stacy's basically become an expert on this as an IoT expert.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.760]   I mean, the router is one of many IoT devices.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.200]   Any device that's on the internet is, you know, I mean, probably could.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   I don't probably consider the router an IoT device.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   I know.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.200]   This is why it's so upset with these things.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.280]   For what you talk about it's not.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.480]   But for the purposes of this discussion, any device in your house that's on the internet
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.720]   is an IoT device.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:29.880]   And routers are particularly problematic because they have access to all the bandwidth and usually
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.800]   have strong enough computers that they can actually do something.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   Right.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.840]   You're not going to put VPN filter on a Hue light bulb.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.000]   Well, they are powered.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.440]   They're powered and they have some firmware and they have some processor, it just depends
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.440]   what you need.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.560]   But most of the time these botnets don't need a lot of processing power.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:56.720]   The speculation from Talos is that Fancy Bear was creating this massive botnet and 500,000
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.760]   soldiers in your botnet.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.120]   That's a pretty damn big botnet.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.000]   As part of the light bulbs, though, they would do nothing because they'd be limited by Zig
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   B.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   They would have no bandwidth.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.480]   Did you see that there is a Z wave hack?
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.400]   We will talk about that.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.160]   Steve says it's not as bad as it sounds.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.160]   I'm going to echo Steve.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.280]   I'm going to echo Steve.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.000]   But to echo the book you were talking about, status update terror.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.160]   It's a screenplay.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.880]   We'll see if it ever gets made.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.880]   Netflix call me.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.520]   Yeah, if that Netflix funnier die, it's going to be one of the two.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.480]   It would just, I mean, it's just even listening to you explain to people, you know, oh, this
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.880]   is how you might update it.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:43.360]   But the notion that you would actually have to get to the firmware and do something significant,
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.680]   the router is such an important thing, but there's no helpline really.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   There's no.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.920]   So this is why I actually, Stacy, you said this and I give you credit because this is
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.560]   actually the right thing.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.560]   And this is why I lump routers in with IoT devices.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.000]   Do not buy any device in your house that goes on the internet that does not being kept
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.400]   up to date by its manufacturer and does not have pushed firmware updates because to your
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.360]   point, Joe, no one should have to go around and figure out if there's an update for your
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.520]   oven doorbell, light bulbs, cameras or routers.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.080]   They should just be updated.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.040]   Unfortunately, there are not a lot of routers that do this.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.640]   All the mesh routers do, fortunately, but and there, I'm sure.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   For now.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.640]   Well, right.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.200]   Because how long are they?
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.960]   When does the life cycle end?
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.480]   Well, that is a good question.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.840]   Although, I mean, I replaced my routers probably every five years.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.760]   Oh, yeah, it should for sure.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.280]   Yeah, probably three, but because they get burned out.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:50.600]   So the telos says that what Fancy Bear was up to with this botnet was a Ukraine attack
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.440]   and probably to bring down the grid again.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.400]   They've already, the Russians brought down the, it's believed brought down the Ukrainian
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.480]   grid for several hours last year.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:05.440]   And it's not that it's not that they don't particularly like the Ukraine's Ukrainians.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.280]   It's just that they're very good test bed for what they want to do to the West when the
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   time comes.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   So this is all cyber wars.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.720]   I don't think they do like well, they don't like the Ukrainians either, but I was like,
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.960]   wait, I think they're actually there.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.960]   They're their favorite whipping boys.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.160]   Well, no, a lot.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   Well, I don't.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.800]   So that's a long, that's a long tail for another day.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.520]   So this is cyber warfare.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.800]   And that's why the FBI rightly should be involved.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:39.720]   This is not, this is not a hack to get into your system so they can get your credit card
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.760]   numbers.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:48.520]   This is not a hack to, you know, take, you know, some kid wants to take down, you know,
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.400]   twitch streamer.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.600]   This is a cyber warfare.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   This is, this is aimed directly, ultimately at the West and probably at the grid, although
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   there are other things that could use it against as well.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.440]   You guys will probably know the answer to this.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:07.800]   Did we ever get to the bottom of why there was a internet blackout a few years ago?
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.640]   Like I remember seeing that IOT was somehow involved.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   Yes.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   That was the Mariah.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.640]   That was the Mariah button.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.640]   That same exact thing.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.440]   Except this time it was two kids from where were they?
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.760]   Duke Rutgers.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.240]   It wasn't fancy bear.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.360]   It was fancy pants.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.120]   But otherwise exactly the same.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.400]   It was Mariah infected routers.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:36.480]   Then they attacked, they attacked Netflix and no they attacked you.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.640]   The DYN was the one that, the...
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.560]   DYN is who they, that's right.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:45.680]   Because that was a big DNS server for a lot of companies and it had the effect of taking
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.040]   a bunch of them down including Netflix.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:54.600]   But the irony of that, and this is how this is quantifiably different, certainly qualitatively
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:33:00.000]   different and actually yes quantifiably different, is that that was two college kids who were
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.040]   trying to make a DDoS network for taking down, I think it was Twitch accounts that they could
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.040]   sell.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.880]   You could take your favorite streamer offline.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.400]   But it got out of control.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   That's what that was.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:24.520]   This is a nation state harnessing a massive army in order to target another nation state.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.480]   This is serious stuff.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.480]   Minecraft servers, you're right.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.480]   Thank you.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.160]   The geek reminds me of the chatroom.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   It was Minecraft servers that these Rutgers kids were trying to bring down when they're
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   right.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:42.560]   Well, if it makes money, I mean, why not try?
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:48.720]   I think the thing that scares me the most about hearing about botnets like this as well
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:56.480]   as the big talk last year about fake accounts online and impersonation and sock puppets
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:02.560]   and then the sort of wars around automated amplification through bots is that we have
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.200]   to start to think about these as multi-frontal attacks.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:14.720]   The idea isn't that they're really focusing on one specific sector of the internet, but
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:23.640]   they're thinking across the spectrum of platforms, software, hardware, which is definitely something
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:30.880]   much harder to take control of, but also could be much more effective in causing a really
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:40.120]   big blackout or putting people up for putting state department resources up for ransom.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:48.560]   I mean, so much of the internet has left us vulnerable to these open-ended attacks that
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.360]   I think that you're right to say that this is different than people messing around, but
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.320]   when I hear about it, I think about all of these other ways in which we are insecure
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:05.200]   in our information, ecosphere, as well as insecure in our networks.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.280]   And I wonder how these things are eventually going to fit together.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.280]   Well, this is right up here.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.760]   I mean, this is what you do.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.600]   This is the stuff you research, but I actually have been wanting to ask you this because
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:22.640]   when it's become more and more clear, I think initially the kind of the simplistic interpretation
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:28.440]   of it was, "Oh, the Russians did not want Hillary Clinton to win the election.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.800]   So it wasn't so much they wanted Donald Trump.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.400]   They just didn't want Hillary Clinton because they didn't like her."
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:38.080]   And so they did some stuff to, you know, bought ads on Facebook and created fake accounts
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.720]   in order to swing the election.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.960]   That turns out to have been a very simplistic view of what was going on.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.600]   And it's, I think, very clear now it's a highly coordinated attack.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:56.640]   It's an attempt is to coordinate to attack the West in not just fake news, but with routers
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.160]   and with everything else to disrupt the West.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.680]   It has nothing to do with disrupting the election.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.560]   That was just part of an overall thing.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.200]   So it's not just the memes.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.240]   It's not just Pepe the frog.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.240]   It's everything.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.440]   And we've been thinking about this in the office a lot because we're trying to understand
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:21.360]   the effect that this has had large scale across multiple institutions, right?
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:31.840]   We're looking at now reports of military style attacks on information in the sense that there
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:40.160]   are battles that never happened, shots that never took place that are getting reported.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.800]   We're seeing climate reports that were untrue, right?
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:53.680]   That they're getting reported as real events or fake storms or fake chemical spills.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:59.320]   And we're trying to understand what is a test and what is a scenario that they're trying
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.880]   to run and then how would they scale those scenarios.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:08.640]   And for me, I think when people start messing with democracy or the press, those are very
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   open systems.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.040]   They're open social institutions.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.880]   They're very vulnerable as a result.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   They're very vulnerable.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:20.200]   But then we have to think about how might the techniques learned there scale to law,
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   economy.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:28.000]   And so we have to be really careful as we move forward with our policies about infrastructure
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.880]   and how we're going to moderate the internet because I've already hearing people talk about
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:39.360]   splinter nets and people are thinking about maybe it's the right time for one internet
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.280]   over here to lock up the internet borders.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:51.280]   And part of me wonders if what the damage we're going to do holistically to what makes
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:57.040]   the net great by trying to lock down all of these different problems.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:02.640]   But I think the economy right now is very, very vulnerable to attack, especially because
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:08.800]   so much information that flows through platforms is about when and what to purchase related
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.080]   to stock.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:16.000]   And there have been attempts to manipulate the information about stocks to get people to
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.160]   either buy or sell.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.080]   That's as old as the stock market itself.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.360]   But I'm wondering about how might that scale and how...
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.160]   That's an interesting vector, isn't it?
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.680]   It is, but it's a hard...
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.520]   So you attack the grid, you attack the economy, the markets.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.280]   I mean, and we attack the press.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:43.600]   So I guess really the question that really the larger question is, what does Putin want?
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:51.000]   I mean, I don't know if it's only him that is at the forefront of some of this, right?
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.440]   There's just...
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:58.640]   There's so much of this that we study is just in the name of chaos itself.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.440]   And so there's a lot of fellow travelers.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.840]   I think that certainly a lot of the players, especially the American players are in it for
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.840]   the laws.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.640]   But the puppet master, there's a goal.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.960]   I would think Putin wins maybe if there's chaos in the West.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.320]   But I think that there's a large...
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.720]   There's got to be a larger goal.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.480]   I mean, clearly the West is a threat to him.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:25.080]   The European economic zone was a massive threat to Russia.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.360]   The strong U.S. is...
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.800]   And it's sanctions or it's a threat to Russia.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.640]   I mean, an oil and gas is still an important industry there.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:43.080]   And there was all those problems with Tillerson, which was supposed to be a peacemaker.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:49.280]   And so I think that Putin maybe anticipated having stronger ties and better connections
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.600]   with the government that's in place.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:59.280]   But also, I mean, you can only set up in stage and strategize so much.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:05.200]   But usually it's hard to predict what people in power want when they're multi-billionaires
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.040]   as well because they have everything that they could possibly want.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.440]   But you also don't want to destabilize West because that's your market.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   I think...
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   That's one of the reasons I don't worry about China so much.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.440]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.160]   No, I was just going to say, Putin and there is a certain...
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.360]   Might makes right kind of category in the concept of a liberal democracy where you look
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.880]   out for people.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.480]   I know we're not quite living it.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:38.800]   But the idea of looking out for people and not letting strongmen take over, that is very
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:47.520]   threatening to both his worldview, but also the way his country is currently run.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:53.200]   So it makes a lot of sense that getting us to a point of chaos where authoritarianism
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.720]   looks good, I mean, that would be awesome.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.400]   It would be a win for his worldview.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.000]   If you Google what does Putin want, you'll find about 8,000 different points of view.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And I don't know.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   It's certainly not hard.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   We're not experts in this and it's not our availability.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.960]   That's not going to be scientific.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:17.080]   But what is interesting to us is I think it's become very clear now that a lot of...
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.800]   That they're starting to take shape.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.120]   I mean, and I think this botnet, this VPN filter is just the latest piece in the puzzle.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:28.720]   It's starting to take shape that there's a concerted effort in a lot of different spheres.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.800]   And a lot of the things that we are talking about all the time on this show, fake news,
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:38.040]   virus of security, privacy.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.400]   I hate to have a scapegoat, right?
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.640]   I hate to say, oh, it's the risky.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.520]   We did that for a whole generation.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.080]   Oh, it's the Soviet Union.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.080]   Maybe there is?
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   Maybe it is.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:55.760]   No, I think a lot of us are abdicating our responsibility to look out for each other and
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.760]   to take as much responsibility as we can for our situations and those of our neighbors
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.520]   and our friends and our citizens.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.520]   So...
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.520]   Yes, I agree 100%.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.360]   It's too easy to blame Putin.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:19.800]   I think that he taps into a certain level of L'Ozzie chaos that he does exploit for gain.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:27.480]   In terms of the kind of media that they run, the state run media, it's definitely preferable
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.600]   to have a narrative about America being in chaos and being able to show that and have
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:39.520]   that also reflected in the media in America that says we don't know how to fix our systems.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:45.400]   And it's like, and as you start to look across all these important sectors of institutions,
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:52.480]   you start to see many, many more instances of polarization.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:59.800]   And so this demonstrates, I think, to someone who's a very authoritative ruler is that if
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:07.920]   you can keep a hold on your country's narrative, other countries look very...
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:14.720]   The state is going to fail in a big way because they've chosen this economic route, these
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.120]   cultural values.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:24.360]   And so there's much to be won in terms of creating a narrative of propaganda for your
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   state.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.080]   It's fascinating.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.080]   Okay.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   I don't know if we want to keep talking about Russia.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.440]   We went down a rabbit hole on that one.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:43.240]   I will say California, they're sent it just past 23 to 12, a net neutrality bill.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.680]   I don't know if you guys care about that.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.400]   I live in California, so I do.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   There you go.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.880]   A lot of your people might.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:55.320]   Although California, by the nature of its size, of its economy, does definitely influence
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.720]   this, the nation as a whole, right?
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.720]   Yes.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:04.600]   So now it will go to your state assembly and it will be voted on hopefully in early fall.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.160]   Can a state restore net neutrality?
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:15.600]   It can restore aspects of it in that state among buyers.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   Using its economic...
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.920]   Yeah, people who buy it.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   So...
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   I'm going to...
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   I don't know.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   I mean...
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   It'll be interesting.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.520]   If it does pass, it'll be interesting to see.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:31.640]   If your state decides, are you really going to get AT&T to...
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.440]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   We'll see what happens.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   Here's the...
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   Here's the...
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.440]   Here's the good news.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:43.800]   AT&T and Comcast and two major industry trade groups spent a million dollars lobbying Sacramento
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.080]   and it failed.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.080]   So there's that.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.080]   I don't...
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.080]   Wait, hold on.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.080]   Only a million dollars?
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.080]   I know.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.080]   That seems so low.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.080]   Guys, come on.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.080]   So we see what Uber spent in Austin when they were trying to get us to not keep them up.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.080]   Oh, a lot more than a million dollars, yeah.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.360]   I think it was like 10 million spent.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.120]   Anyway, but you're right.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.880]   It's got to get through both houses.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   It passed the Senate.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.880]   It taught 10 million.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.880]   Comcast...
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:10.880]   Just in...
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.880]   Okay.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.880]   Comcast, you...
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.440]   You're letting us down here.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.600]   So the Senate has passed it.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.920]   That's very good news.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.280]   I don't know what the prospects are in the assembly, but if you're in California, call
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.840]   your state assembly member and say, "Pass SB 822.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.600]   SB 822.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   That's good.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   We like it."
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600]   "It's like 822 when it gets to me."
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   Whatever it is, AB.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   Sorry.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   They'll know.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.880]   If you say SB 822, they'll know what you mean.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.880]   Actually, you probably say...
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.880]   Shut up, Stacey.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.240]   That net neutrality law.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.240]   You know, that thing.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.240]   There you go.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.240]   That rule.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.240]   You want to...
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.680]   Actually, let's take a break because I think I need some coffee.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.680]   Do you need some coffee?
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.520]   Stacey, do you drink coffee?
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.000]   Not anymore.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.880]   I'm trying so hard.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.880]   It's so hard.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.880]   I would love to drink coffee.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.160]   Because you think that might be related to the...
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.160]   The migraines.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.160]   I thought caffeine is used.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.800]   The first thing coming back.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.440]   Oh, that's good.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.920]   I thought caffeine was sometimes used to treat migraines.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:15.560]   It is, but apparently regular caffeine use for certain kinds of people with certain kinds
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.680]   of migraines, it can be a trigger.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.160]   It also becomes less effective if you're automatically...
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.120]   Oh, save it.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.800]   Save it for when you need it.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.440]   Yes.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.120]   I need it every day.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.880]   I've been here several times a day.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:36.360]   Unfortunately, we have found the best coffee, our official coffee of Twit, comes from a
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.600]   single family farm in Brazil.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.440]   Thrace Pontas.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.680]   Now I know it in Portuguese it would be Thrace Pontas.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.800]   But I'm saying Thrace Pontas because I want you to be able to spell it because I want
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:54.160]   you to go to Thrace Pontas, T-R-E-S-P-O-N-T-A-S.com/Twig.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.200]   And get some of this amazing premium coffee, non-GMO.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.600]   It's a single family farm.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:06.280]   They've never sold in the US before, but the race family thought, "Hey, let's try this."
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:11.800]   So they arranged to have their coffee shipped, green beans shipped to the US, fresh roasted
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.520]   in the US for quick shipping to you.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.800]   These beans, we got five days after they were roasted.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.160]   They were roasted on May 21st.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.160]   So they're still very fresh.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.160]   Let me open it.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.880]   Actually, before I open the bag, I want to show you the coolest thing.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:35.040]   On every bag of Thrace Pontas, and this is from the Nina's Jarrus Farm in Brazil, this
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:40.800]   is a French roast.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.840]   It's the smoothest cup of coffee you ever had.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.760]   Actually, there's a reason for that.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.560]   Coffee grown on the race family farm.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.840]   So it's pulped natural, not washed.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.080]   That means the pulp is still on it.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.600]   That makes a smoother cup.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:58.480]   First other coffees, equatorially grown coffees, they have to wash them because of a mold problem.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.640]   They don't have that problem.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.040]   At the high mountains in Brazil, a seater is pulped natural.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.040]   Now watch this.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.560]   This is so fun.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.560]   There it is.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.680]   Oh, I have to do it again now so you can see it.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:15.200]   So I take a picture of the QR code on the bag, and then look, here's the Google Maps.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.960]   You can actually see the bush where the bean...
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.240]   There it is.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.120]   Here's where the bean was grown.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.480]   Right there.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.200]   That's the race family farm on the hillside there on Traceponthus.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.080]   Let me open this up though.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.640]   You got to smell this.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.760]   I'm sorry, Stacey and Joan, you can't.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.240]   I guess no one can't except me.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.240]   It's so good.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.560]   It's the best coffee you ever had.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.560]   So smooth.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.560]   Now here's the deal.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.320]   We're going to get you a special offer.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.640]   If you go right now and subscribe at traceponthus.com/quig.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.000]   You got to see these things.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.760]   Drov Andi and Aco crazy yesterday because he wanted to smell them.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.080]   Look at those beans.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.800]   They're fresh, pulp natural, just delicious.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.600]   So good you just might want to eat them right out of the bag.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   Here's the deal.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.800]   If you go to traceponthus.com/quig, you're going to get 10% off your subscription.

[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.880]   I like the idea of a smaller bag mailed on a more regular basis because then it's always
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.880]   fresh.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.800]   You can use some light, medium, dark and French roast.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.480]   This is the French roast.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.120]   Shipping is free in the US.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.840]   When you subscribe, you get 10% off.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:36.520]   But if you do it at traceponthus.com/quig, another 10% off when you use the offer code

[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.080]   This would be an awesome Father's Day gift.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.960]   You could tell dad the whole story about the farm.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:54.560]   Dad, take the picture of the QR code traceponthus.com/quig.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:01.800]   Use the offer code twig for 20% off every bag of coffee in your subscription.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:06.200]   You can't also order on Amazon if you just wanted to do it easily, but you don't get
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   the 20% off.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.560]   You've got to go to traceponthus.com/twig.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:14.840]   All right, Stacy, you can uncover your ears.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.160]   We're done talking about coffee.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.280]   Oh, but are you still drinking it?
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.480]   Because just watching someone drink it, I'm like, oh man.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.480]   Oh man.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.880]   Yeah, I don't know if I could give up the brew.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:31.120]   It's honestly not that I've ever kicked a drug habit or anything super hard, but it
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.720]   is one of the harder things I've ever done.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.240]   See, if I don't drink coffee, I get a headache.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:39.160]   Well, yeah, and I did a slow taper.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.720]   And believe me, I end up going back on the caffeine right now.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:49.000]   I'm back on the -- I'm coming off the wagon back on the -- I don't know which wagon I'm
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   on.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   It's hard.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   It's hard.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.240]   You're on and off the wagon all the time.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.560]   Chrome 67 is out.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:03.680]   I want to show you something kind of cool with a new Chrome.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.320]   There are a number -- apparently a number of new features, but first of all, this is
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:16.600]   what you need to do is go to Settings and under Settings about Chrome.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.760]   And you see I'm on 66, so it's going to download and it does it pretty quickly, 67.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.920]   I think it eventually just does it automatically, right?
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.920]   Updates Chrome automatically.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.280]   Yeah, I don't think I've ever manually updated Chrome yet.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.680]   You might want to on this one.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.160]   If you're interested in -- among other things -- and I know you are progressive web apps.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.160]   So there's --
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.160]   I'll download it.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.840]   I'll relaunch.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:49.800]   And then the first thing you do after you relaunch is Chrome colon slash slash flags.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.520]   So these are the kind of experimental settings in Chrome.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.960]   Let me make this a little bit bigger so you can -- you can --
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.920]   No, I was like, "Wow, what's happening?"
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:57.920]   Tiny experiments.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.280]   Type in PWA in the search and you're going to enable all three of these.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:07.280]   People full code cache.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   PWA is this progressive web app that gives you the capability of going to a site -- well,
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   go to mobile Twitter.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.200]   There are a lot of progressive web apps.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:16.680]   And install it basically is a Chrome app.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:23.200]   And you're going to be able to do this also on iOS and Android.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.200]   So okay, I've done that.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:29.480]   I'm going to relaunch one more time and go back to Chrome flags and I'm going to type
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.480]   app.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.960]   Here it is.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:36.960]   What was it?
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:41.960]   It was app banners.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.040]   Here we go.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.560]   Enable display progressive web app banners.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.800]   And experimental -- yeah, let's do those.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.240]   We're going to turn those on.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.360]   This for now is an experimental feature.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.400]   It's the progressive web apps.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.720]   But let's go to -- all right.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.720]   Truvago will do this one.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.080]   Truvago.in.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:06.320]   So this is -- if I go to Truvago.in, it looks like a website.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:18.640]   But if I go to settings, you'll see -- this makes you feel a lot better, Leo, because
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.840]   this is me installing every IoT device.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.840]   >> I know.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.840]   >> This happens.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.840]   Oh, wait.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.640]   >> Yeah, I know.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   I did this on Windows Weekly minutes ago.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:35.120]   Partly because I'm on -- I have edges that default browser here, which is probably part
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.320]   of the problem.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.840]   Let's try it with m.twitter.com.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:53.800]   That's the Twitter progressive web app.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   Go to the menu.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.400]   Open in Twitter Lite.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.640]   So I guess -- oh, you know what?
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.840]   I know why, because I did it on the other computer.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.240]   It was already installed.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.200]   What you will see is install Twitter Lite.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.360]   This is a PWA.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:11.720]   Now, this is going to show up in your folder, your Chrome Apps folder, as a progressive
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.160]   web app.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:19.680]   So this is the new hotness, the idea that websites -- it looks like a website, but in
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:24.680]   fact, it's code that you can download and make kind of semi-permanent.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.680]   That's two.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.680]   Here's another one.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.960]   Let's try the -- I guess the Trevago.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.360]   It's only because I have it open.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.360]   Oops.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.040]   Here I have the AGO.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.600]   .in.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:39.320]   And again, I'm going to open it in Trevago.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:43.400]   This is a standalone PWA, progressive web app.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:47.880]   So if you want to play with those, Chrome still has to launch, kind of like the Chrome
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:55.840]   Apps, but it's a different model entirely, and it is now enabled in '67.
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:59.240]   I'm sure there's other great reasons to get '67.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:05.280]   Doesn't it have the automatic stoping of -- or automatic muting of -- that was my big
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.280]   excitement, right?
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.280]   Of noisy tabs.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:12.720]   It was like, that's worth it, no matter what you feel about Web Apps.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.720]   Yes.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:18.160]   Go for the noisy tabs, but stay for the Web Apps.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.000]   That's my -- that's my model.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.120]   That's the glitz that will get you the door.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.720]   Gets you in the door.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:24.720]   All right.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.680]   Now, hold on.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.440]   That process has closed my rundowns.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.160]   Let me go back to that.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:36.080]   There was a lot more in the Mary Meeker slide show about Internet advertising, but we don't
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.160]   need to cover that.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.160]   We don't really care.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.800]   That's only Google's core business.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:45.640]   Oh, you want to -- because actually there are some interesting slides in there I could
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   show you.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.560]   I'm like, let me go back and pick up some Google.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.160]   I feel like we haven't talked about Google very much, and I know everyone.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.160]   Oh, you finished the Chrome thing.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.160]   Let me finish this.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.400]   I forgot to mention this.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.480]   There is also a generic sense -- now, this may be a bad thing.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.960]   A generic sensors API.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:06.200]   It exposes data from device sensors to public websites.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:11.840]   So your accelerometer, your gyroscope, your orientation, your motion sensors can now be
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.200]   read by apps.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:21.840]   Wait, the ones in our sensors or in our phones can be read by how?
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.080]   Using this API.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   Not in your iPhone probably.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   I bet you.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:33.880]   But if you're using Chrome on Android, on your phone, then for instance, you could have -- if
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:40.120]   you use a VR headset like the Google Gear, I mean the Daydream or the Samsung Gear, that
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:47.720]   phone sensors now can be read by the app that's running in Chrome to monitor head movement,
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:49.080]   things like that.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.360]   I was thinking you were talking about all of the sensors that I have around my house with
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   accelerometers.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.360]   No, not those.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.360]   How does that happen?
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.880]   How good it can't read those.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.520]   More -- a lot more security, strict site isolation.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.640]   I think what you were talking about.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:07.320]   That actually will help with meltdown and specter.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:13.000]   Passwordless authentication via web-awthing.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:19.320]   They've dropped support for public key pinning.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.280]   And then the support for PWAs is in there.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.000]   So there's a lot of new stuff.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.520]   This is a big update to Chrome 67.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.520]   Just came out.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:34.640]   You want to see the new Chrome UI?
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.520]   We can do that too.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:43.560]   Let me go to Chrome.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:47.320]   colon slash slash flags.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:55.920]   Do this one more time search for UI.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.960]   UI layout for the browser's top Chrome.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.160]   Is that the one?
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.800]   I don't know.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:07.560]   Let me go back to this page.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:11.040]   Let's see what the flag is.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.000]   UI layout for the browser's top Chrome.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   UI layout for the browser's top Chrome.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:23.480]   What do I choose?
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.400]   You want the refresh design.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.400]   OK.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.400]   Refresh.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.400]   You ready?
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.400]   Shall we check?
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.040]   Let's see what the new layout looks like.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.040]   Don't do it.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   That's exactly the same.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.040]   All right.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.040]   So, OK.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.600]   Thank goodness for that.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:46.880]   Talkles between normal for clamshell devices hybrid previously touched for devices with
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:47.880]   a touch screen.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:48.880]   That's probably what I should put on here.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   Touchable.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:54.480]   New user unified interface for touch and convertibles.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.400]   Material design refresh.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.800]   That's the new one.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.720]   It is a little more material.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.200]   There's a little prettier.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   Wow.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:07.240]   I'm glad I wasted five minutes doing that.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.320]   It says it's OK.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.320]   It's Google.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.320]   All right.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:16.800]   Shall we go back to the meeker slides?
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.400]   You want to know what men who aren't in jobs spend most of their time doing?
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.400]   I do.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:25.440]   What do men who aren't working spend most of their time doing?
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.440]   It appears.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:30.280]   Well, more of them, I guess, spend they spend three more hours.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.000]   Is this a week daily watching television?
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.240]   Yes, I agree.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:40.160]   But only an additional 0.6 hours sleeping.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.520]   That's other including sleep.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.640]   So I'm kind of like, dang.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.720]   And even less doing household activities and services.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.680]   So that we knew too.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:53.720]   Here's another slide for something that you knew.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.480]   Locomotive jobs versus aircraft jobs.
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.320]   Why is this in here?
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.960]   It's showing that technological change doesn't kill jobs.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.440]   It brings them in new places.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.040]   So the next couple slides discuss.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.000]   Ah, agricultural versus service.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.440]   So point being the rise in service jobs more than made up for the loss of an agricultural
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440]   jobs.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.480]   And maybe I'm just becoming more cynical with old age.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:25.760]   But looking at these slides, I'm actually kind of stunned at how it glosses over a lot
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:31.840]   of the inequalities of things like the Airbnb housing, like how it increases rents in cities,
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:36.480]   how it glosses over things like the flexibility offered by the economy.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:45.520]   But how that's not necessarily offset by having a job that you can depend on.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.840]   So I'm getting kind of frustrated as I look through this.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:56.480]   I'm like, hey, your worldview that is looking cracked and kind of not egalitarian is showing,
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.480]   I guess.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.600]   Yes, but that's technologists, right?
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:06.640]   And I would guess that the kind of reason that she doesn't spend time on it is the underlying
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.760]   assumption almost just a given that well, it all works out in the end.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.000]   That's the point, right?
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.520]   So yeah, there's dislocations here, but then there's improvements here.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.080]   And it all is going to work out.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.960]   For instance, you talk about gig economy has technology made it easier to find freelance
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.960]   work?
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.880]   77% say yes.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.640]   So yeah, I look at this.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.640]   So on this, yeah, on demand jobs, filling needs for workers who want extra income, flexibility,
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.640]   etc.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.520]   And there's a whole section on Etsy and Airbnb and Uber.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:47.480]   But I think you're our right that there is among technologists, this just kind of basic
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.600]   assumption that well, you're going to have disruption, but it's all going to work out
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.600]   in the end.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.960]   I guess sometimes it feels tone deaf right now.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960]   Yeah, it does.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.560]   Sometimes with a mystery variable, like we're going to throw in, oh, I know basic income
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.560]   there, that'll fix it.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.120]   That'll make the equations balance.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.920]   And either of you have been following any of the storyline around the taxi medallions
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.720]   in New York and the rise of Uber, Lyft and other rides.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:22.640]   I am so so yes, but I am so skeptical of that as a quote unquote storyline.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.840]   I am I understand the narrative.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.720]   I understand how these things play into it.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:33.320]   I really have a lot of questions about, is it just Uber or is it the lack overall of
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.000]   a safety and a thumbnail?
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.800]   What is what is the story?
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.600]   Well, it's been on the news a lot.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:45.680]   There's been five cab driver suicides related to having purchased these medallions with
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:50.440]   their they were over a million dollars in some cases, just a few years ago.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:55.120]   But that the city knew or they're speculating that the city knew that these ride sharing
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.960]   apps were coming and there wasn't anything done to ease the market.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:07.880]   And there's all these laws and regulations about the standardization of the cabbies schedules
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.760]   and the standardization of how much it costs.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.560]   So everybody gets the same rate, right?
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.320]   And that's supposed to be a virtue in this economy is that you don't get into the cab
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.200]   and they can just name their price.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.120]   But as a result, a lot of people are feeling both that they were scammed, but also that
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:34.320]   there's really no way out of this debt and there's this I've been seeing videos.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.920]   So is the medallion price set a market set completely?
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920]   It's market based?
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.880]   Yeah, they're generally auction, but many of them went on the market, you know, decades
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:48.480]   ago and people bought them and they get passed down through families or they get sold.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.120]   But somebody must have some point done a calculation saying, well, it's going to cost a million
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.880]   dollars, but I will pay it off in X number of years, right?
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.800]   Or it wouldn't make sense to buy it.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:06.240]   You know, in other words, the taxi is going to earn this much to make it up.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.120]   So what you're saying is that I see it feels to me like, well, I'm sorry that these guys
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:17.320]   got screwed, but a million dollars for a medallion is a long way.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.960]   Yeah, it used to be with that.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.360]   The before you worth it and you would buy it like you would pay it like you'd pay down
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.360]   a mortgage.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.760]   It would be a three year span.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.760]   And the belief was that the city would enforce such regulation so that the ride sharing apps
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.560]   couldn't take over such a high proportion of the market.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:41.120]   Similarly in London, there were, you know, it's very, very expensive to get a cabbie
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.320]   license in London.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:48.160]   You have to memorize 600 points of interest and it's really like.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.760]   By allowing ride sharing, you live in New York, right, Joan?
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.760]   Yep.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.560]   So have you noticed, I've heard all sorts of anecdotal stuff like, well, the reason the
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.760]   traffic is so bad in Manhattan is because you've got, you know, half of the traffic
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.160]   is Uber's and lifts.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.720]   Somebody in the chat room is saying that this is hell's kitchen NYC.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.720]   So I take it.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720]   He lives in the city.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.280]   Taxi medallions in New York were awarded during the Depression to stop exactly what
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.400]   these ride sharing people are doing my street near the theater district.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.320]   Just a bunch of Uber X cars sitting double parked waiting for a call, which they never
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320]   get.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.000]   I go and I easily get a cab.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.040]   He says the medallion system may be broken, but it was better than what's going on right
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.440]   now.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.040]   So maybe, maybe the upset is that they should, that the city should never have allowed as
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.880]   Austin tried to never allowed ride sharing.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.320]   Well, we, so no, we allowed ride sharing.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.880]   We just didn't allow those who didn't have background checks.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.120]   We were not against ride sharing.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.360]   There are many cities though who just don't want ride sharing.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:56.800]   That's, I mean, there was a definite problem with not necessarily in New York so much as
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:03.080]   like in San Francisco, you know, you can never get a cab in San Francisco prior to Uber launching.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.040]   That's, that's why Uber's in out here.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.000]   Uber is, is beloved.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   Same thing with L.A.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.880]   It's beloved because that's the only way you can get a ride.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.120]   And there, there are definitely people.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.120]   It helps.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:21.280]   And I look at my mother-in-law who can't really drive anymore, but has, and again, has the
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.760]   income to pay for people.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.320]   And you know, other than calling a cab every time she wants to go someplace and hoping
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.320]   it shows up.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   Right.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.640]   Now she just, it's funny.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:32.640]   It's funny.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.200]   Because my mom stopped, you know, got rid of her car fuse.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:41.120]   You go, she's 86, which was a good thing safety wise for her and everybody on the road.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.720]   And she took calves, but she never liked taking calves.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.320]   She was always afraid of the cabbie.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.840]   But I had to persuade her.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.320]   So she wouldn't wait till my sister could drive her, which often was inconvenient for
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.200]   my sister and not great for mom either.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:59.800]   I had to, I set up Uber and Lyft on her phone and I had set it up with my credit card.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.960]   And I said, "Now mom, you know, just do this."
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.680]   And she was very nervous about using that.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.640]   Very, because she'd heard all the bad stories about Uber drivers and so forth.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.880]   But once she started using it and she pretty much gets, you know, the same two or three
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.840]   guys every time, she loves it now.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:16.840]   It's for her.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.840]   It's real freedom.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.840]   Right.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.240]   Of course I'm paying for it.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.240]   Well, but I, but I.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.760]   You're a good son.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.400]   Well, it's, frankly, I would do the same for my kids.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:33.120]   I would much prefer they take Uber because it's more expensive to have a car in many
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.120]   cases, right?
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:38.800]   Well, I think in New York, a lot of people rely on it because yeah, it's, it's crazy
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.880]   to try to have a car and do all the parking.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:47.880]   But there is a level of congestion and then there's just the, there's certain basic rules
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:54.680]   about surge pricing and things that I think do need to get dealt with so that there's
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.080]   some predictability as well.
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:03.720]   One of the things that I've been noticing in the discourse from the CABIs is that there's
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.640]   no ADA access with Uber.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:14.200]   So anytime anybody with some kind of mobility or disability issue that would need a wheelchair
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:19.640]   lift and things, they aren't able to call and have access to those services equally.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:26.080]   And I think that when we see broad changes to regulation, it's going to have to take
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.920]   account of some of these discrepancies.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:34.560]   And the other issue, of course, with medallions is there's a lot of corruption, isn't there?
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:38.000]   I mean, it wasn't the taxi king just indicted?
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.400]   Yeah, no, that, I mean, I have, it's very hard for me to conjure sympathy for, you know,
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:50.480]   an industry that has generally, you know, I mean, it's, it's like anything.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.960]   You have, you know, the garbage men, if they decide that they're not going to pick up your
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.920]   garbage, there's not a lot of options, right?
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:04.080]   And if the taxi lobby had decided, you know, that people, you know, like, for instance,
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.960]   the idea that they wouldn't come pick you up.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:11.040]   I mean, I've been through this many times when I was living in LA, if you were to call
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.080]   a taxi service and it was, you know, we were going to the airport at four o'clock in the
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.720]   morning, you were really rolling the dice.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.080]   But the, the apps, like they provide other services that are useful, like the tracking
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:28.280]   and the mapping and the cancellation and things that you don't get from just making a phone
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.920]   call and crossing your fingers.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:36.840]   Yeah, I, here's a slide that I can't wait to see next year's version of it, the post GDPR
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.840]   version.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:44.280]   This is the internet advertising ad spend up 21% year over year and look at the gray
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.280]   bars mobile.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:49.640]   Look at how mobile is growing.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.880]   But I bet you next year we're already hearing that programmatic ad sales in Europe have
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.280]   plummeted after GDPR.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.680]   It's only been a week.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.680]   That makes sense.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:04.120]   So, so there's a really interesting macro thing to think about.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.320]   We, we are talking about, oh my God, you can't get the LA times or USA today in Europe without
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.720]   going through a VPN.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.720]   Okay.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.400]   But this is what we're trying to do.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.680]   We're trying to regain our privacy on the internet.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.600]   The challenge is will we, there will be disruption.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.800]   Will we come through on the other side with a sustainable business model that doesn't traffic
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.160]   in our data?
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.440]   And it could be a hugely positive thing.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.280]   And maybe I'm naive and yes, I am sort of, but I am optimistic.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.320]   We could take this as an opportunity to say, hey, engagement doesn't matter because we
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.000]   don't want all these people.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.720]   We're less of an ad-generated model.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.400]   And maybe we go more towards a value model on some platforms and then people will pay
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.400]   for things.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.520]   Yes, it does mean we have to pay for things.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.800]   For some reason I hear Jeff's voice in my head at this point.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.200]   I know, I know.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:01.400]   And I'm not going to say, you know, there's, this is an opportunity to rethink some of
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:07.120]   the things, the assumptions that we've let big companies build the web on.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.840]   And I don't think we've all realized that.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.120]   And as we realize that, this is a good chance to see it laid bare.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:20.000]   And I think we're going to start in a few, hopefully weeks seeing stories that talk about
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.520]   what data is actually out there.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.040]   And I honestly can't wait.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.240]   So we need to have this reckoning, I guess.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   Yeah, I think this is always coming.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.760]   Well, maybe I don't know if it's always coming, but I think it is.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:33.760]   It's been a long time coming.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760]   Let's put it that way.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.760]   And I'm glad it's here.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.280]   And because we've gotten so far without it, I think we're actually going to go further
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.880]   in the realm of sharing our data than me might have otherwise done.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:50.320]   So one of the things Mieker says that tech companies are in a privacy paradox.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:55.440]   They're caught between using data to provide better consumer experiences like Google and
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.800]   violating consumer privacy.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.600]   And different companies choose different points on that balance.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:08.200]   Obviously Apple's tilted toward privacy, Google's tilted towards better quote, better consumer
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.200]   experiences.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.480]   Maybe we talk about that a lot.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:20.080]   It's interesting to me too though, when I was talking to some students about data and
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:28.080]   privacy and asking about how they end up seeing the ads that they wanted to see.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.640]   They didn't really have a notion of what they didn't see.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:41.920]   And so I often wonder about if advertising was less personalized, would it open up a different
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.040]   set of options for people?
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:49.520]   I know for me, the kind of advertising that I hate is when I make a one-time purchase
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.200]   when I moved to New York, we had to buy a bed.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.000]   And for months, I was getting Target marketed mattress ads.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.040]   And that's because they knew you moved?
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.520]   It was, no, I had searched for mattress.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.960]   Or you searched for it, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.960]   Yeah, I know.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   I did it to myself, but at the same time.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   Well, you did it.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.600]   I think what's more interesting, I don't know if you guys saw the ARIS Technica story.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:22.880]   It was about personal injury lawyers targeting ads to people in emergency rooms.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.760]   So this came out yesterday.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:32.040]   It was based on reporting from the Philadelphia WHY affiliate.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.200]   And basically what happened is marketers were taking data from phone data.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.720]   Location data, yeah.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.920]   It was, well, it wasn't always location data.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.960]   So they were using geofencing, but they were using either your Wi-Fi data.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:51.320]   So like UCLID is a company that keeps data on phones and their Wi-Fi networks and where
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:55.240]   they are, that sort of thing, GPS data and/or cellular data.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.800]   So your cellular carrier might give this to them.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.000]   And then they were saying, hey, when you're in the ER and for a while afterwards, you would
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.480]   get ads from--
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   So wild.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.480]   Personally.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.480]   That's so wild.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.480]   That's so wild.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.200]   Is in-- was it Connecticut?
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:13.440]   I think they-- I don't know if it was in here or in the original story.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:20.600]   They were-- one of the state attorney's generals had come down on this practice for our pro--
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:28.200]   no, anti-abortion groups targeting ads towards people who were waiting in Planned Parenthood
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:31.320]   and other reproductive health organizations.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.520]   So if you were in one of those places, you would start getting like those ads that are
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.440]   like, "Ophidas is a baby," kind of those kind of things.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.040]   And they were like, yeah, that's not cool, you guys.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.640]   But that's where like, I think we're headed if we're not careful.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:51.880]   How much harm, though, is there really in getting-- I mean, you're going to get ads on
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.680]   your phone when you're in that emergency room.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:56.680]   How much--
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.680]   Well, is that the creepy line?
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.880]   I mean, if it's not like you're going to get more ads, you're going to get ads one way
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880]   or the other.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:02.880]   So maybe you're going to get ads for something--
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.880]   It's crossing the creepy line.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.880]   Yeah, I understand.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.880]   But--
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.600]   It's like when Target was like, hey, that chick is pregnant before anyone realized it.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.600]   That's the creepy line.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.600]   And when you cross it, people are like--
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:20.880]   Well, in that case, that's a-- that's-- you know, that maybe that pregnancy could be revealed
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.040]   to somebody before the person who was pregnant was willing to reveal it or whatever.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.640]   But so you get ads that are targeted at your geolocation.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.640]   I don't--
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.640]   People-- like it's--
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.640]   What if you're in the immigrant--
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.480]   What's creepy is because these people know where you are.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.480]   Some weird strangers are having--
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.480]   No one knows where you are.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.040]   No one knows where you are.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.880]   That's the perception.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   But it's not the reality.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.880]   The reality is the lawyers bought ads from Facebook or whatever.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.800]   It says, well, when anybody's there, please show them that ad.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.560]   So yeah, the middle man here.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.560]   Right.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.560]   The middle man is Google.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.560]   Google has all that information.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.560]   Or Facebook.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.560]   Or Facebook.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560]   So whoever your middle man--
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560]   Right.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:05.760]   It's-- people wake up to the fact that they are literally carrying something around in
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.720]   their pocket that people-- that can be used to track them in all kinds of ways.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.800]   But if we explain to them, well, it's not that the lawyer knows where you are.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.400]   The lawyer bought ads based on people's location.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400]   Facebook and Google know where you are.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400]   Did you know that Facebook knows where you are?
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.560]   Well, yeah, I knew that.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.120]   Did you know that Google knows where you are?
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.120]   Maybe they didn't know that.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.120]   So now they know--
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.680]   So what if-- what happens when the cops start subpoenaing that data from companies?
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.160]   What if that digital ad broker--
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.480]   Well, we know that because we know that's secure us.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.480]   We know that's secure us.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480]   We know that's secure us.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480]   So they know that's secure us.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:37.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.480]   So we know that's secure us.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.480]   We know that's secure us.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:42.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:17:06.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.480]   And we know that's secure us.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.480]   And we know that's secure us.

[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.480]   Is that about right?
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.480]   I do.
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.480]   Well, I think they'll.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.480]   Oh, no, because I've had them on a plane.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.480]   So I wore them on the plane.
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.480]   I didn't realize I had.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.480]   I'm a space kid, but I didn't put my noise canceling headphones on.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:32.480]   I just left these in.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.480]   And it was a four and a half hour flight.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:35.480]   So.
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:36.480]   There you go.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.480]   Still five.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.480]   But you know, you don't need noise canceling.
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.480]   As much if they really isolate.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:42.480]   And I think those.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.480]   Yeah, they really do.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.480]   You cannot hear a lot.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.480]   That is a downside that.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:50.480]   And I don't know if they have like a true here or some sort of like you can hear ambient
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.480]   noises, but I'm okay with that.
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.480]   Yeah, I don't want to hear ambient noises on the plane.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.480]   If we're going down, I don't need to know.
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:57.480]   It's okay.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.480]   Oh, people are asking me about the wise camera and the thing.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.480]   So can I give you a second pick?
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:03.480]   Yeah, that's really good.
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:04.480]   Yes.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:05.480]   So wise cam.
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.480]   I think it's w y.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.480]   It's w y z e cam.com.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:09.480]   Let's see.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.480]   Wise cam.com.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.480]   Yes.
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.480]   So they just lunch today.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.480]   The pan cam.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.480]   A $30 pan cam.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.480]   I know.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:23.480]   I ordered one because for $30, why wouldn't you order this thing?
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.480]   What?
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.480]   Wait, the what?
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.480]   I know.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.480]   The horizontal range horizontal horizontal.
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.480]   Horizontal this way is 360.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480]   So whoo.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:34.480]   And vertical is just 93 degrees, but that's, you know, pretty good.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.480]   And it has a.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:37.480]   It has a patrol route.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.480]   And the wise cam itself is really good.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.480]   The $20 HD wise cam Kevin actually reviewed it on our site.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.480]   And I used to have the version one of it.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.480]   I love these things.
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:51.480]   They're pretty sweet.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:52.480]   Oh, I'm just right.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.480]   And it could tag animals.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.480]   Look at see it sees the dog.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.480]   Oh, this is really neat.
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:58.480]   30 bucks.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:01.480]   It's a company that's founded by people from Amazon.
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:03.480]   It's hosted on AWS.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:05.480]   The software is built in the US.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:07.480]   The hardware is made in China.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.480]   So they license hardware from a Chinese camera maker.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:13.480]   They say that all the data goes to you.
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:14.480]   I don't know.
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.480]   You can store it on an SD card.
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.480]   You're rolling 14 day cloud storage.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.480]   You don't even have to subscribe.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:20.480]   Right.
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.480]   Yes.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.480]   There's lots of things.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:23.480]   What?
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:24.480]   Oh, no.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.480]   This is I they're good.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:26.480]   I'm buying it before they're sold out.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.480]   How can they?
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.480]   How can they do this?
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.480]   Stacy.
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:32.480]   So they talked to me because they're they've been buying it.
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:38.760]   So they talked to me because they're they basically say their model is just like Amazon's business
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:45.360]   model, which is reason in margins that you know you make up for by selling a but ton of
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.360]   devices.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:51.680]   I don't know if this is really a credible business model, but this is what they're doing.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:54.480]   I thought they must be making it up in subscriptions.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.480]   Wow.
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.480]   I'm buying three right now.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.480]   Dear Lord.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.480]   Why buy three?
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:04.240]   It has it pans all around the room Leo, but I have two rooms, three rooms.
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.080]   I have a several rooms in my home.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.080]   You don't want to put it in your bedroom.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:11.080]   Oh, you're right.
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.080]   Don't do that or your bathroom.
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:14.080]   You're right.
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.080]   Don't do that to us.
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:19.480]   What a nice like treat for any hacker who hacks into your camera.
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.040]   You're like, ah, can you can?
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:24.680]   Is it like pan tilt zoom that you control or through the app?
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:25.680]   It looks like it.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:26.680]   Yes.
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:27.680]   I don't have it yet.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:29.640]   I don't have it for a patrol.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.200]   So it can look there, stay there for a few seconds.
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:36.520]   Look there, look there, look there up to four points and then go back.
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:37.520]   Wow.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:38.520]   Wow.
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:43.120]   At that price by a dozen.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.760]   All right.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.880]   So we'll have your review when you get yours.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:48.880]   Very nice.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:57.280]   It says you can pan tilt and zoom in the wise app up to for 360 degree live view up to 110
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.640]   degrees a second, three seconds.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.400]   In other words, to go all the way around.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:02.400]   Wow.
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:06.600]   And I should tell you, I should clarify for you guys the got when I talked to the founders
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:14.560]   at wise, they're saying their contention is that you could make a nest cam with the $30
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:17.000]   bomb that they've got basically.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.160]   And that just shows you just what the markup is.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.160]   Doesn't.
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:27.080]   So we'll, I don't, I don't know how much, you know, material costs there are in the nest.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:32.680]   So I can't, I can't verify that statement, but that's what they are touting.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:35.480]   I don't necessarily put in their money with their mouth as they're selling this thing
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.960]   for 30 bucks with no subscription.
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.360]   And I've read their terms of service.
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:43.640]   They're not like pulling your camera.
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:44.800]   What is this?
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.120]   Came to this is the wise cam.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.640]   Oh, yeah, that's the original wise cam.
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.040]   Oh, this is original one.
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:52.080]   I don't know if it's the right they look the same.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:53.080]   It's the second one.
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:54.880]   It's the second one though.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.800]   I know what's called the go or the pan.
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:58.800]   So this doesn't pan.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.800]   It just sits there.
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:00.800]   And how much was this?
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:01.800]   20 bucks.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.800]   That's so what Kevin reviewed.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:08.680]   So I could just put this on my head.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.280]   We had ours by our fish tank for a while just to see if they didn't die like we were
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:13.280]   on vacation.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:16.000]   I mean, did they know?
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000]   How about the camera?
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000]   Did it die?
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000]   It does not die.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000]   Well, that's impressive.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000]   Are we reviewing this?
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000]   Is that why we?
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000]   We already did.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000]   Who did it?
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000]   Megan on the new screensavers.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000]   Oh, I did.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000]   I remember that.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000]   I wasn't here.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000]   Yeah.
