[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   His blog is Buzzmachine.com

[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   Hola!
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   Hello Hola, Senior
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.720]   So it's late at night
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   Oh my gosh
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.720]   Yeah, it's 935
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   Alright
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   And I'm tired
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720]   What we thank you for coming here
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   Oh no, it's always my pleasure
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   I was here to do a Google Big Tent
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   Event and let's do the full disclosure here
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   Is that yes, Google paid my travel up
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   Because I'm a poor professor
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   And I wouldn't do this that way
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   But I do not get paid by Google
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.720]   Take no fees from Google
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720]   Well, given how much you did
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.720]   They ought to pay you
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   Well, here's the thing I should have been able to get
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   I warned them going in
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   I said I'm going to be in Madrid
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.720]   It's going to be hard to order the Nexus 6
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   I don't want a free phone from you
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   I want to be able to buy your damn phone
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   I didn't get it
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   Oh, neither did I
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   And there analyzes a tale
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   But let's first say hello to Kevin Marks
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   He is also joining us
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   Kevin has worked at Google
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   He's worked everywhere
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   Apple, BBC
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   British Telecom
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   He's in his garden as usual
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.720]   And we love having you
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.720]   Thank you Kevin for joining us
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   Great to see you
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   Kevin Marks.com
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   And actually I brought Kevin on
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   Because he wrote a great article about Twitter
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.720]   Which we'll get to in a second
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   But first let's talk about the Nexus 6
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   Today was the day
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.720]   I got up early
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.720]   Really early
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.720]   And started refreshing play.google.com
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   Over and over
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   Just getting you know not
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.720]   Available to order October 29th
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   Available to order October 29th
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   Around I had to come to work
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   So around about 10-30 in the morning
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   Our time
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.720]   I refreshed one last time
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   And oddly it said the 32 gigs were out of stock
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.720]   I thought well that's strange
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   I thought that was an error
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   Or maybe they didn't have any
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   Because there were two memory configurations
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.720]   32 gigs in 64
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   I drove in which is really
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.720]   Literally five minutes
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   And they were sold out
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   Apparently 60 seconds
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.720]   Oh if that
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   You think less Jason?
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   Yes because I was frantically
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   Jason got one
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   I got one
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   I got it there
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720]   I don't know how it happened
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   But yes I mean it was a concerted effort
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.720]   I had one browser on one side
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.720]   The other on the other side
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   You know the blue on one side
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   The white on the other side
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.720]   Refreshing
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.720]   I noticed a change on this side
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.720]   It suddenly went from
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   About you know pre-sale soon
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   To out of inventory
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   Like immediately
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.720]   Yeah
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720]   So then over there I just started hitting
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   And at some point I got in
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   But it was
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.720]   I would probably say it was
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   For sale
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.720]   Maybe 30 seconds
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.720]   Each device before it was complete
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   So that's
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   Crazy
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   Wow
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   Go go
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   So I didn't get one
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720]   Gina did you try?
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   I didn't even try
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   I can't do it
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.720]   I'm sticking with my OnePlus right now
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.720]   Yeah
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   I'm trying to be Zen
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.720]   About the phone that I have
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   Yes
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   But Jeff and I were both
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   Gonna buy one we couldn't
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   We couldn't do it
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   Now I have to say
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   I'm not completely disheartened
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   Because
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   Yeah I gave my OnePlus to
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720]   Father Robert Ballis there
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   But I have to note for
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   Which I actually really like
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   So I'm not without
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.720]   Well I know
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   Even if you ordered it
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.720]   You're not gonna get it for a while
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   Probably late November December
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   What shit ships
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   No they get it later
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   Then everybody else is gonna get it
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   Yeah well that we know that
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   November 21st of the ship
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   Date
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   You know what we should do, Jeff?
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720]   We should just wait till Jason gets
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   His
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   We should listen to his review
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   And then decide
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.720]   Yeah
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   You're that
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.720]   You're that control sure
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   I'm just saying it's what we should
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   Do
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   See I didn't try and buy it
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   Because it seemed a bit expensive
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   And I still like the look of the
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.720]   OnePlus one but I haven't found a way
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   to get one of those yet either
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   So I'm still seeing the Nexus 5
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   Feeding left out
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   And not too
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   They sold, they went online
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   What is it, Monday this week
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   Offering it
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   Without invitation
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   Oh they didn't that now
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   Okay, well they only did
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   For what, one hour right Jason?
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   It was going to be one hour
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   They had all sorts of side issues
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   They ended up extending it to three hours
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   And still people couldn't get in
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   And they registered their orders
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.720]   This is kind of the way of the world now
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   Which is these
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   It's ridiculous
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.720]   They're high-end
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.720]   Flagship phones so fast
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   But if you've got it
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.720]   How many do you think Google had?
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.720]   What do they have ten in the box?
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.720]   I'm sure they had quite a lot
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.720]   But this, you know
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   Twenty-seven manufacturing
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.720]   Means they have to make small
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   Wow
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   Yeah, so you said they were expensive
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   I guess they were
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.720]   They are not the low-cost
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.720]   Nexus 5
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   Variety
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.720]   Or even OnePlus one
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.720]   OnePlus one is 64 gig
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   OnePlus one is
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   $350 and a very good
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.720]   Very good phone for that price
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.720]   Yeah, it's a good deal
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   OnePlus
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   I just, you know, and I'm happy
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.720]   With the Note Floor or the OnePlus
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   But I did kind of want
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   Lollipop
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   Yeah
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.720]   That's the thing, right?
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   That's what I really want
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   I want the
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.720]   One software
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.720]   I was kind of bivalent about the size
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   And you know, of course I always want the new Nexus
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.720]   Just because the Nexus line has been so great
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.720]   But it's the software, right?
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.720]   But look, we'll get the software
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   I'll get pushed to the Nexus 5
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   The Nexus 7
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.720]   We'll see, we'll see Lollipop
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.720]   You could, I could get an Nexus 9 tablet
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   Oh, those didn't sell out
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   Those are some reason
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.720]   They got lots of those
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   That's some reason
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.720]   They got lots of those
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.720]   Yeah, what is it?
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   Is it the 9 inches?
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   But it says it's just right here
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.720]   Well, yeah, the real problem is
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   I have an Nexus 7
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   And there's nothing wrong with it
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.720]   Yeah
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   And I'll have Lollipop on that
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   At the same time, right?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   Yeah, I haven't got ran to put in Lollipop
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   On that with the dev build yet
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.720]   So I don't want to use the dev build up
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   But I do want, when 5.0, if 5.0 comes out
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.720]   I do want to put it on something
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.720]   You'll get it on the 7
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   Yeah
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   That's fine
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   That's good enough
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   And if you have a Nexus 5, you'll get it
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   And given that they're saying that
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720]   The Nexus 9 leaves the warehouse
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.720]   November 3rd
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   And we know it'll have Lollipop
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.720]   That sounds like that's when Lollipop will be available
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   As early November
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   Like 4 days
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   I'm such a hoarder by instinct
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.720]   Now that you can't, the Nexus 7 is just going to
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   You know, I almost want to buy one
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.720]   Just have a backup
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   That's a good cool
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   That's a good cool, yep
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.720]   You're like Kim Kardashian and her blackberries
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.720]   She told Kia Swisser and she had like five blackberries
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.720]   The Kardashian references, she didn't know
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   You crush me every time you do that
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   You lower yourself from the bottom
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   And on time where I hold you
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   Down to earth and below
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   This was a neat code in the view
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   And it doesn't compute
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   This is a recode interview
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   This is a recode interview
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.720]   This is a recode interview
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   This is a legit man
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   This is like the Daily Mail
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   This is really the one that's hard
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   Hitting tech reporting here
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.720]   Come on
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.720]   And as Liz Gaines noted in her
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.720]   Description of the interview
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   Kim's makeup looked incredible
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.720]   Despite the theme
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.720]   No, actually, I really thought this was going to be
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.720]   Kia Swisser's going to join us on Twitter on Sunday
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   Oh, nice to see you
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   I'll ask her, you know, what it was like to hang with
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   The Kardashians
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   It's funny, the only photo that I saw
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.720]   They were both, both Kara and Kim were like
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   Not at all facing one another
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   Like the body language, totally they both have facing out
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   Terrible body language, yeah
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.720]   It just didn't look like they were
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   Connecting really
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.720]   But I found her profession of love
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.720]   For the Blackberry, you know, really interesting
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   I don't know
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   She says she has several
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.720]   Because she can't live without it
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   It's a Blackberry Bold, by the way
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.720]   It's not even like a recent Blackberry
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   She uses her iPhone for pictures
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   But the Blackberries for the real business
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   Forgetting that
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   She buys them off of eBay
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.720]   And has three spares
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   So when one break, she uses a spare
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.720]   And then she e-bays another one
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.720]   And she always has three spares
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   She said if she could buy the company
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   That was the funniest thing
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.720]   Kara said, you should just buy the company
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   She said, hmm
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.720]   She probably could afford it
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   I'm sure it's a fire sale
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.720]   She could buy the profits out of that game
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   Out of the game, yeah
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.720]   Use the profits from her game
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   To buy Blackberries, amazing
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.720]   I love this idea
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   Well, now we know that Gina watches that show
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   Right?
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   I think I just fell asleep in Madrid
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   And this is a nightmare
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   Gina's a huge fan
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   I'll spare you my
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   I find the Kardashian brand
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   And the way that it was built
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   And the family fascinating
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   I think there are a lot of fascinating aspects
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720]   Of it
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   Do you think Kara is also a secret
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   Kardashian fan?
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   Kara is totally pro Kardashian
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   She was defending the interview
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   From the get-go
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   First of all, the success of the game
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   Is amazing
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   And I don't think it's a testament to the
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Kardashian's tech savviness
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   It's a testament to the power of their brand
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   Which is amazing
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   I mean retail stores, TV, the app store
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   I mean fashion, clothing, you know
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   Perfume
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   I mean in every avenue
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.720]   Like you put their name on it
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   And you make tons of money
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   And that's fascinating to me
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   And they're so social media savvy
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   Like the most liked Instagram photo ever
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   Is she her and Kanye's wedding
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.720]   They apparently spent weeks on their honeymoon
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   Like tweaking it before they posted on Instagram
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   I mean, she's, you know, extremely savvy
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.720]   And I find that interesting
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   Wow, she looks...
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   I'm gonna get lots of email about this
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   Here's the body language
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   They're just kind of...
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   I don't believe Kardashian is real
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   It doesn't look like one of those
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   It's one of those
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   It's one of those Eduros
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   There's Japanese 3D models
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   Exactly, exactly
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.720]   That's not real, that's not a human being
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   What? Jeff?
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   Of course she's a human being, Jeff
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.720]   What are you talking about?
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   You know what? Here's what Liz Gain wrote
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   In the, Liz Gaines wrote
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   In the end, the most impressive thing about Kardashian
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   I guess her new name is Kardashian West
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   This woman has incredible endurance
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   To deflect the hate
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   And continue to do this thing that she chooses to do every day
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   Which is something Jeff Jarvis advocates
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   Which is share her life
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.720]   True? It's true
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.720]   You know, the glue game Hollywood had been out for a long time
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   And it was a glue, I don't know if it was glue
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   Or Kim's idea to put her brand into it
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   But that's what made it a sudden hit
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   And you know, I've played it
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   My daughter loved it
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   And I played it, it's actually a very fun game
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   I mean, and the message of the game is something I get on board with
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   You work really hard
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   And then to make things happen, right?
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   I mean, in the game you work really hard to be famous, right?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   And that's what they do
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   I guess it is a form of work
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.720]   Yes
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   Yes
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.720]   But I mean, you know, it's Tiny Tower
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   But for, you know, celebrity
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   It's tiny tower for celebrities
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   But that's a really interesting thing
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.720]   She works really hard to be famous
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   But that's absolute, absolutely
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.720]   A description of what she and others like her Paris Hilton
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   People who don't have any outward
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   Particular skill
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.720]   They're not writers or actors or performers or musicians
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   Their skill is that they work really hard
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   To be famous
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   Yeah
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   They're famous for being famous
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   Like Peggy Cass in our days, Leo
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   Yeah, we had them
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   What the hell did Kitty Carlisle do?
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.720]   Actually, she was a writer
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   She's not shaking her
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   Yeah, but I mean, they're have been
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.720]   We are old, yeah
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   They've always been people who are famous for being famous
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   Usually they were public intellectuals
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.720]   No, not me
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   Look, she's a model
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   And a fashion, I mean, he was fun
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.720]   Maybe they were comedians
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   But well, you know, Charo
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   Charo was the closest thing to Kim Kardashian
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   She was famous for marrying a band leader
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   Xavier Cougott was the Kanye West of his day
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   She was famous for being sexy and voluptuous
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   Cuchikuchikou and talking in a funny Spanish accent
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   She didn't actually, I mean, she sang
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.720]   But I don't think, you know, she sang in Cuchikuch
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.720]   It's a band, but I don't think she was a great singer
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   She was Kim Kardashian
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   If she had had a mobile platform
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.720]   She could have done a game
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   Did you like Charo?
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   No, she's dropping nuts
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   (Laughter)
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.720]   Anyway, I
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   Anyway, we don't mean to diverge into it
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   There's lots of Google News to talk about
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   We probably shouldn't talk about it
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   I'm sorry, I'm busy watching the interview
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   I can't look away
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   It just delighted me that there was some sort of
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   parallel between Jeff and Kim
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.720]   We'll get the behind-the-scenes story
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.720]   on Sunday from Kara
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   I'm sure there's some stuff
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   Don't you think?
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.720]   There's a little something
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.720]   Yeah, that's actually that body language isn't so bad
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   No, there was that one still that got out
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   and they were facing away from each other
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.720]   I think that's just
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   I think, knowing Kara
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.720]   who's a fairly sardonic
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   Smart but sardonic person
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.720]   I'm sure she got the humor of it
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   Oh yeah
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   What was Zajaga Boor famous for?
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   There's a good example
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   That's a good question
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.720]   At least Kim has a game
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   and a hit TV show
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.720]   Alright, so what should we do?
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   Should we beg Google to send us
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   Nexus 6?
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   Should we just turn it on?
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   I already complained
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.720]   I have to say, I sent the message
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   to the Google line
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   I said, I was going to warn you when I complained
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   and I said I'm a screenshot
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   of the out of inventory
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   and he said, he, well back and said
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   they proved to be popular
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   Now, you may say, oh come on, Jeff
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   but let me show you this picture
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   because we were talking last week about
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.720]   Inbox, which is the Google email program
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   Gina very kindly did pull some strings
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.720]   to get both me and Jeff
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   Inbox
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   and I love it, I don't want to ask you how you love it
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   but as soon as we talked about it
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   look at the tweet
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.720]   because we were speculating, I bet these guys
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.720]   are watching as we talk about it
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.720]   Yep, there is the Inbox team
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   That's the greatest thing
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   Watching us talk about Inbox with beer
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.720]   That is amazing
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.720]   I get treated that
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   Alright, I guess I'm going to show you
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   when Leo was trying to find something
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720]   and then he finally did find it
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   I said, I imagine there were Googlers saying
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   yeah, Leo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   That's what they were
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   It's a great, I give credit for
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.720]   who put the picture there.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   Jason Cornwell
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.720]   Thank you
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   And then for Leo
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.720]   Jason, I presume is on the Inbox team
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   because his twitter icon has a giant Inbox
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   icon in his hand
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   and there it is
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   If you read the little name tags there
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   I think that's him
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   This is Dask 2
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   Yeah, the Bearded Guy
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   So pretty sweet
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.720]   I'd be really impressed if they took a picture of this
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.720]   On the screen
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.720]   Yeah, let's do Inception
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.720]   You take a picture of this
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.720]   Keep going, keep going
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   Keep just looking at you looking at us
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.720]   (laughter)
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.720]   Just actually before we move on from Inbox
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   Gina, what do you think a week in now?
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.720]   So I haven't been using it full time
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   because my main email address is my Google Apps address
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   It doesn't work, it doesn't work then
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   I mean, I like it so much that I briefly considered
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   changing my whole email setup
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.720]   so everything gets forwarded to Gmail
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.720]   so that I could use Inbox full time
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   but I just never got around to it
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   I'm gonna wait until it's Google Apps
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   but I'm sold on it
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.720]   I'm totally into Inbox Zero
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   I love the idea of deferring messages
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.720]   to later to remind me
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   I think the app is beautiful
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.720]   the material design
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   I love
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   so I'm just waiting for Google Apps support
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   Jeff, you can't use it either
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   because your mail is an app
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   Same thing, the interesting thing is
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   it's sending more alerts to my watch
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.720]   from the account I hardly use
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   Well, you could turn that off
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   I like that, yeah, I know, but I like that
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   I mean, yeah, I'm liking it
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.720]   I only use it only once a day
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   Well, I have to tell you
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.720]   I am in love
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   Really?
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   Yeah
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.720]   I got to Inbox Zero
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   Nice
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   which I've never been
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Shh, nada
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   and I don't worry
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   and with a cut
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   like three check-ins, four check-ins a day
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   I'm able to stay there
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   It's the only solution I've ever had that actually really works
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   Nice
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   and all my mail goes through this account
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   there's no, this is not like
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   a secondary account
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.720]   it's the account
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   That's great
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   I haven't seen any flaws
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   it's like I'm not
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   I don't think I've missed any mail
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   because you really understand
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   when you're using this Inbox program
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   you're letting, basically letting
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   Google do the filtering
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   You can add filters, but
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   they do such a good job
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   My worry is that I'm going to swipe away
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   some grouped number of things
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   you know, conversation is that
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   and miss something, but that was my same worry
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   about Priority Inbox
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   and it's been great
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   I mean, it's fine
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   because as long as I can sort of see
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   control a little bit and trust
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   based on my behavior
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.720]   which I've been using Gmail
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   you know, every single day
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   for the past almost ten years now I guess
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   I think if I can get past that
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   but you don't feel like you've swiped away anything
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   or missed anything important
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   I swiped away something
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   that I went, "Oops!"
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   and it's the top of the done folder
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   so it's easy to get back to
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   So everything's there, right?
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   and it doesn't fully document it to me
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   for instance, there's a low priority folder
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   which seems to get
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   everything
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   in my responses
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   I don't understand why stuff's going there
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   as well as done
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   but maybe if there's documentation somewhere
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   that's the other thing
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   I've not read any documentation
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.720]   I've just used it
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   That's because you're a human being
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.720]   that's what people do
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.720]   they don't read the docs
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.720]   and I love it
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.720]   I have found it to be
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   exactly what I was looking for
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   and you know, email's so broken
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   and you know, we've got to be fair
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.720]   this is based on a lot of work done by Mailbox
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   which is now a Dropbox company
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   they used some techniques that Outlook Mail uses
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   the sweep thing
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.720]   so it's a merger of ideas from a variety of sources
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   but I think they really did a nice job
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.720]   Having about the invite, having that
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   So if you use the app
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   you get three invites, I guess, after using it for a while
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   use those up right away
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   and then
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   I haven't tried yet, I haven't got an invite
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   Kevin, I'm sorry, I would send you an invite
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   if I had one but I'll send one to you Kevin
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   there you go
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   that's your reward for being on this show
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   Kevin, you use Gmail as your primary mail
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   and it's not the apps version
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   I use Gmail, yeah
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   and but I mostly use it on my phone
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   Yeah, this is really well suited to mobile
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   there's a web interface as well
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   Yeah, well, I use it on the web on the computer
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.720]   and on the phone
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   but I don't live in email anymore
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   I've stopped doing that
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   Yeah, I stopped too because it's so broken
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   Sparrow Mail was bought by Google
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.720]   I wonder if these are the Sparrow
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   some of the Sparrow folks, that's right
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   Sparrow was a very nice app
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.720]   remember that? It was Mac only
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   really liked that
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   and Boxer was another one as well
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   Yeah
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   I mean the leg up that Google has
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   is that this is a native client for Gmail
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   that can do the multi-tag things
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   right, I mean this is the thing we were talking about
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   last week is that with Gmail you can assign multiple tags
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   and you can nest them to one message
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   right, whereas the pure iMac
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   or pop implementation
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   is one folder
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.720]   so I think like this is the great thing
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   that something like in box can do
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   that maybe other
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   party clients can't maybe can't do as well
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   or maybe won't implement as true to Gmail
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   Yeah, it's really just another way of doing
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   it's another window into Gmail
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   It doesn't, you still can use Gmail
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   you can go back to the Gmail interface
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   everything you've done in inbox will
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   be reflected in Gmail
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   I can't tell you how happy I am when I go to Gmail
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   and I don't see any
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   I see inbox zero, I've never seen that
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.720]   I used to see 25,000
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.720]   messages
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   You get the sunny message, the sunny day
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   Go enjoy your day, isn't like a picture of a sun
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.720]   Oh, I haven't seen that yet
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   I guess I'm not truly zero
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.720]   I had this in the change log
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   but I might as well mention it now
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.720]   because we're talking about inbox
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.720]   the inbox app is now in the Chrome web store
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   it's basically just a bookmark
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   to the web based app
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   but if you want to add it to your apps page
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   and Chrome on the desktop
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   Yeah, you can just search for it
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   Here's the one page
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   for as a Chrome look user
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   this is true of the new docs
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   the new drive
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   and one box haul
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   is you need offline support
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   Yeah, and this does not have offline right now
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   I think that
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   and I think that the new
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.720]   drive
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   which I'll always try that
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   oh that's pretty
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   uh oh, where's the offline?
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   Back to old drive
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   right
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   you could still have your Gmail
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   offline as your offline version of Gmail
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   Yeah, use that version
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.720]   but you're not using one box
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.720]   well inbox
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.720]   so you can but that's the thing
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   I use inbox when I'm online
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   and I use it all the time
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   but if I got on an airplane
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.720]   I'd make sure I
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   I just stacked it
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   but see I've processed my mail so fast now
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   it's not like I have a big bunch of backlogs stuff to work on on the plane
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   most of my mail is apparently junk
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   Yeah, it's true
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.720]   it's true
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   turns out
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   I didn't really have anything in there
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   yeah, you know we're using
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   we use a slack at a I think up to talk
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   you know my team to do team
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   and it's great and so we just
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   stopped using email
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   we only use slack
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   so and now that I'm not really doing much freelance work
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.720]   I just the email just doesn't matter as much
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   so I'm terrible at email now
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720]   and I feel a little bad about it
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.720]   because I wrote a book with a chapter dedicated
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   to managing your email
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   I'm so bad now
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   but you wrote a Gmail add-on
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   that everybody used for a long time
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.720]   yeah, yeah I wrote better Gmail
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720]   I love Gmail
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   and of course like I'm never going to not going to have email
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   but the nice thing about slack and other messaging services
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   is like oh these are folks
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.720]   the whitelist that we were talking about last week
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   you know these are the folks that I know need to get a hold of me right away
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   they're my teammates
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   they're my co-workers
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   and yeah it's crazy I was on the plane
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   I was actually coming back from San Francisco
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   and I full disclosure I should say
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   I was at I was in San Jose this weekend
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   at Google's Mentor Summit
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.720]   for their Google Summer of Code program
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   I was a mentor this summer
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   yeah and they paid for my travel
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   and I actually never got to the Google campus
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.720]   I stayed at the hotel
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.720]   all the sessions were at the hotel
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.720]   it was a meetup of open source coders
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.720]   it was a lot of fun
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   but I was on the plane on the way home
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   and you know the guy said next to me
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   was on GitHub and slack
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   like work with a user coder
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.720]   and I was like oh wow okay
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.720]   and slack came up several times
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   in several different sessions
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   and it became so quickly
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   this ubiquitous app
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   that it feels like everybody's using
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.720]   everybody uses it
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   well for me I think it's
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   sort of private version of the
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.720]   I R C plus wiki way of working
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   which is how we do the open stuff
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.460]   any open source thing will have an I
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.720]   C channel that you go and chat in
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.720]   and standard stuff does that too
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   and then you have a wiki to keep the persistent thing
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   and slack is just like a
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   sort of private version of that
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   so you have a chat room that your stuff's in
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   but the neat thing is all the integrations it has as well
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   so every time you touch anything else
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   that sends a little note to slack
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   and you've got a record of that too
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   so I'm using it for a couple of different
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   startups I'm working with and it's great
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.720]   this is Stuart Butterfield's
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   startup the he of course was the founder
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.720]   flicker with Katarina fake
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   and it's nice to see Stuart do something
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   no it's great and
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   and they have a hit
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   yeah it's a huge hit it's a great it's a really great app
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   we've been using because we use
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   Jira, Atlassian Jira
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   with our dev team for the website
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   they have hip chat which is kind of a similar
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   solution so we do it all in Jira
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   but I think I can see why people use slack
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   it's great it's a great solution
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   alright let's take a break
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   we've got lots to talk about
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   as you mentioned the reorgate Google
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   puts Sundar Pachai in charge of the whole
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   getting a bootle
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   practically
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   we can talk a little bit about Apple Pay
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   because when the Rite Aid and CVS shut down
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.720]   Apple Pay they also shut down Google Wallet
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.720]   and all other tap to pay solutions
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   and you'll be delighted to know there's news
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   on the front of Leistung Schutzrecht

[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   continuous
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   and we'll also talk to Kevin
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   about his article his blog post
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   he's going to get just
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   prepared he's going to use the word
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   "Fatic" again so
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.720]   "Fatic"
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   I didn't even say it
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   I hope I'm saying it right and now I'm wondering
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.720]   who knows P-H-A-T-I-C
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.720]   Kevin I'm betting on you
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.720]   I would think he's probably right on this one
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   has to do with grooming I think
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   I don't know

[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   so Sundar Pachai who
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.720]   I first met him
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   at a chrome event
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   he was in charge of chrome
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   is that how he started at Google?
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.720]   it's been there a while
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   he has been there a while
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   I'm not sure
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   so he moved from so he was chrome
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.720]   then Chrome OS
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.720]   then Chromebook
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   when Andy Rubin left
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   Android to go to do something
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.720]   with Google X
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.720]   he took over Android
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   he is in charge of Google apps
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.720]   and now Larry Page has announced
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.720]   they're going to transfer
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.720]   leadership of almost everything else
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.720]   to Sundar Pachai
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.720]   they set on a memo
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.720]   last week
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.720]   announcing this
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.720]   in fact the only thing that aren't
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   under Sundar Pachai
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.720]   is YouTube
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   Susan Wojcicki
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   is still running YouTube
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   and reports directly to Larry Page
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   and that makes sense actually
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   I want to talk about
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.720]   another article by Ben Thompson
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   we talked about it on
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   Sunday he wrote an article called
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   "Peak Google" on his
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.720]   blog's trajectory and one of the things
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   we've been talking about a lot lately
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   has Google reached the peak with search
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.720]   and search advertising
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   and one of the things you can definitely point to
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   that last week on this show too
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   really, Ben was great on
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   Sunday talking about this
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   and then I was talking about Jason Snow
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   on Monday on triangulation
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.720]   and it's really clear that YouTube
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.720]   was a brilliant attempt
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   by Google to find the next thing
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.720]   and it is probably one of the shining lights
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   so it's interesting
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   that that is still
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   from Larry Page's office with Susan Wojcicki
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   I think
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   I don't know what else is not
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   in his purview
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   maybe the investments the Google
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   ventures but he's got
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   a lot of story minutes
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   said that he's CEO material
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   and I think that's
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.720]   that means here or elsewhere
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   he's got
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   energy, he's got access, he's got
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   NEST, he's got Calico, he's got Google X
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   he's got corporate
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.720]   what he didn't get
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.720]   I'm sorry, I apologize
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   Page continues
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   so part of this said, Larry said
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.720]   look, I'm just getting too
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.720]   I'm just all I'm doing is reading reports
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.720]   so I'm going to give a lot of this to Sundar
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   so Page will keep
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.720]   kind of the next generation stuff
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   access, energy, NEST,
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.720]   Calico, Google X
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   and then kind of, I don't know
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   administrative stuff like legal finance
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   ad sales will stay under him
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   corporate development.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.720]   He says, Page says, I want to focus
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.720]   on the bigger picture and I couldn't
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   do it with all the stuff I had to
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   do.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.720]   What do you guys think? Pachai, I think, is a very
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.720]   smart guy
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.720]   and he's a, you know, he's a
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   Google guy.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.720]   Yeah. And he's
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   he's got a good reputation
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   for actually building things that work inside
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   Google and that's
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.720]   that's valuable I think.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.720]   He arrived at Google more
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.720]   more good at getting things
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.720]   actually done. Yeah, getting things done is a good
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   thing to have in a manager, I think.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   He arrived 10 years ago
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.720]   he was he was at McKinsey went to
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.720]   Wharton School of Business, Stanford
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   and the Indian Institute of Technology.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.720]   He's from Chennai.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   Apparently Microsoft considered him
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   for CEO.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   At least that was the rumor.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   Twitter tried to recruit him several years ago.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   He is now
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   basically senior vice president
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.720]   in charge of all of our products.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.720]   But
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.720]   people have been pretty clear that he's not on the
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   CEO track.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   Except he is, isn't he? I mean
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   somewhere. Yeah.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   I mean he's obviously very well
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.720]   trusted. Yeah.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   And you know I don't know what it's like to work
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   directly for him but it sounds like he's
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   a guy who's known for building bridges
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.720]   and making things happen.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   And I don't know I always like it like the
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.720]   maybe in response to see jobs I sort of like
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.720]   the idea of the executive who's not a complete
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.720]   a-hole. You know like that there's like that
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   that one kind of management style.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.720]   I like to hear about the other one.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   My brief interaction with him
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   it was when Chromebooks started coming out
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   and I said I don't get it.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   I don't see why anybody would buy a whole computer
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.720]   that just is a browser
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   and instead of getting pissed off
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   which he could easily done
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.720]   or becoming defensive we had a great conversation
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   about why he thought this was a good market
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   and he was right by the way in every
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   respect and I was wrong.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   But it was a very not it was a nice
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   pleasant conversation. It was good.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.720]   I was really impressed.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.720]   I didn't know he was going to become the guy
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.720]   running Google though I would have been nicer to him.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.720]   Maybe maybe you could have gotten a phone.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   I might have been able to get an X is six.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   [laughter]
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   Some concern in recodes article about
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   this by Liz and Kara
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.720]   does mention that
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.720]   well if Sundar is now in charge of everything
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   what happens to other executives
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   who are now underneath him instead
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   of underneath page and their conclusion
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   is most of them are long time
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   Google loyalists and probably will not
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   leave Alan Eustis in research.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   He's the guy.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   This is another story who jumped out of
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   the bed just broke the record for
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.720]   high altitude parachuting.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.720]   That's an amazing story.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.720]   Amid Singal is in search David
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   how is it best, Bruce?
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.720]   Is that how you pronounce it?
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   He's a Google plus social
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   gen Fitzpatrick and maps
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   Shridhar Ramaswami on ads and commerce
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   or his whole soul on technical infrastructure.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   They say these guys are Google loyalists
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   and of course Susan will just give yourself
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.720]   who rented her garage to the boys
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   when Google started out
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.720]   and I think that's
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   where Pichai being
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   very well respected and well-liked
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   comes into play
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   and people aren't going to leave
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   and he's not known for crackin heads
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.720]   he's known for pretending it's done
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.720]   it sounds like Paige just needs more time
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.720]   to do, you sit around
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.720]   and think of big ideas right?
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.720]   instead of file go through TPS reports
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   on alpen at some level
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   if you're frustrated you can't get an answer
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.720]   from Larry, you can't get an answer from Larry
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   and you can't get an answer from him
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   and the problem with Google is
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   what I hear from a lot of Googlers
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.720]   is it's far more like the
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   military than I ever would have guessed
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   really?
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   that person is a rank G43
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   and then they took his other job
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   so they'd be a rank G10
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   yes it's
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   I was very surprised at that
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   there's heavy ranking within
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.720]   Google is what I hear
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   it's interesting
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.720]   it's a flatter hierarchy than that
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   it's too big now
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   it's from 50,000 people or whatever the number
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   it's too huge
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   what was it like when you were there Kevin?
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.720]   well the thing that's
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   they structure
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.720]   and those kinds of internal rankings
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   and things like that
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.720]   they have grades in different people
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   in different grades
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.720]   what they were good at
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.720]   when I was there was not having that
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.720]   that sort of grading
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.720]   and the structure was worse
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.720]   so it wasn't that you get promoted
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   through these grades and that created
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.720]   the containment hierarchy
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   it was much more of a team-oriented thing
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   for building things and the management
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.720]   pathways reporting chains
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.720]   were relatively short
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   and also if you're making something new
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.720]   you did have to go and pitch it to
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.720]   Larry and Sergey at some point
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   so that was part of the process there
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.720]   but the drawback of that
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.720]   was that could potentially create bottle next
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.720]   and that was something that was
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   it was Marissa Marissa Meyer
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.720]   for example had office hours
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.720]   but she was very very busy
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.720]   which meant you had to queue up outside her door
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.720]   to get a minute of her time to get approval
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.720]   to do certain things
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.720]   so that sort of caused a problem with scaling at one point
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.720]   so it's always a challenge for any of these
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.720]   management things is like
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.720]   do you try and build a
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.720]   hierarchical organization or do you try and build
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.720]   teams that can coalesce and build things
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   and it was trying
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   really hard very long time to keep it
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.720]   as small teams to work together
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   but a lot of the things that they do
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   making you share offices and things like that
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.720]   are designed to encourage that
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   sort of small team feeling as well as being part of the whole
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.720]   well they're doing something right
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.720]   but it is a challenge and I think
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   that's one of the things Ben Thompson
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.720]   pointed out with Pete Google
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   which as we talked about last week
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.720]   but we also talked about Sunday
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   is it's a real challenge
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.720]   for any tech company
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.720]   Michael is so quick
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.720]   and it's the innovators dilemma
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   it's how do I maintain my success
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.720]   today
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.720]   and yet plan for the future
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.720]   future which is coming at
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.720]   full speed straight at us
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   search clearly
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.720]   is being supplanted by something else
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.720]   social sort of
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   I don't know what
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.720]   certainly search ads
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.720]   aren't going to last forever
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.720]   Google hasn't really looked mobile
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.640]   although I think that's possible but maybe that's not
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.640]   even the future of advertising
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.640]   so and YouTube
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   and Ben said this is shining light here
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   clearly the future is bright for YouTube
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   let me
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.640]   so Alan Eustace who is a senior vice president
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.640]   is apparently
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.640]   watched with interest
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.640]   Felix Baumgartner jumping out of a
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.640]   spacecraft
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   sponsored by Red Bull and GoPro
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.640]   and breaking the record
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   for high altitude jump
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   watched with interest because
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.640]   he actually been planning the same thing for a couple of years
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.640]   and Google even said hey we'll sponsor
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   and he said no I don't want to make it too commercial
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.640]   I just want to jump out of a balloon
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.640]   he didn't actually want to wear glass
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.640]   while he was doing it that was the thing
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.640]   he didn't wear glass did he?
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.640]   he had a couple of GoPro cameras
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.640]   there he goes
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.640]   kind of unceremoniously
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.640]   that's to a giant balloon
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   and they just let him go and they said bye
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   wait Red Bull and GoPro sponsored it
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.640]   no the other guy Felix
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.640]   they didn't nobody sponsored this
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   and we sponsored Alan paid his own money
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.640]   ok I can afford it
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.640]   goes up 25 miles
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.640]   here he goes
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.640]   he's releasing now 25 miles
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   part of the problem is that
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.640]   when you get that high it gets very hot on the sun side
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.640]   and very cold on the other side
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.640]   so they had to have all sorts
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.640]   he's in a space suit basically
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   yeah Felix got a little life support system
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   he had built around it
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.640]   he took him 15 minutes to come down
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.640]   it's not a lot of work
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   I mean you basically are falling
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.640]   the whole way
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   landing's hard though watch
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.640]   he comes in for
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.640]   whoa
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.640]   oh he's amazing
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.640]   but he's fine he's raising his thumb
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.640]   he made it
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   it's not that different than skydiving
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.640]   that let you know the landing
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.640]   oh it's just a long
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   fall
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.640]   and there he is just fine
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   he couldn't so they had a switch
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   for him to talk to the ground on the radio
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   but he didn't want to move because it was so hot
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   so instead of talking back he just
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   twitched his leg
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.640]   once for yes twice for no or something
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   I don't know
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.640]   that's a great story
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   I love Googlers
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.640]   they're fun fun people
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   so tell us
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   about your article on
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.640]   you're back to a pay us a
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   piggany or whatever it is
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   so what did I call it
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   I could basically
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.640]   called it
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   how Twitter became the hate speech
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   wing of the free speech party
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.640]   wait let's get this let's parse this
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.640]   the hate speech wing
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   of the free speech party
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   so certainly Twitter is great for free speech
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   and that's the thing they've always been very good
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   at free speech and that's been a part of their DNA
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.640]   from day one and it's something that they've
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.640]   very strongly for
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.640]   but that puts them in intention
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   with people who are using it
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   abusively
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   but my take on it is that
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   they've sort of
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.640]   gradually changed the way that
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.640]   Twitter behaves so that
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.640]   it's much more of a useful platform
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.640]   for people to annoy each other
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.640]   on than it used to be
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.640]   so when Twitter started
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.640]   the point was that
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.640]   we had
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.640]   the time of blogging we had blogs
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   we had blog comments and they tended
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.640]   to fill up with people trying to
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   pester you and with various ways to try and get around
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   I can take some of the blame for building technology
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   and making it easy for people
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   to write something on their blog or ping you
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   and sit on your blog
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.640]   and you can see comments
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.640]   basically didn't verify anyone you could just go in there and shout at people
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.640]   and they were annoying
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.640]   so the social network sites were ramping up
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.640]   because they said okay
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.640]   you can only see things from people who
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.640]   your friends with
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.640]   and Twitter did something subtly different
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   which was they created one way following
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.640]   so they said
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.640]   you can publish things and you can choose who you're following
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.640]   and that's what you'll see
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   so you basically had to decide who you would see
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.640]   but there wasn't this awkwardness
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.640]   it had to be reciprocal
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   you had to be friends as you had to do
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   on Facebook
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   and so that
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   the valence of that was nice
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   but there were some subtleties
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   what it meant was that
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.640]   when you went to Twitter
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   early on you didn't even go to Twitter
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   most of the time it would come to your phone
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   you would sign up with SMS and SMS
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.640]   it would come to your phone
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   and it was a kind of group SMS feel
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   and they had the web version
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   and they also had an IM version
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.640]   it would patch into IM and you would get
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.640]   tweets through IM as well
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   it feels so long ago
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.640]   that the Twitter stream could be encapsulated
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.640]   on your text messages or an IM stream
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.640]   right
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.640]   but it was just a few of us
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.640]   and it was a few friends
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.640]   and that's the answer you chose who to follow
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   and then gradually we added
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.640]   we invented ways of bridging the gap
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   as users and then Twitter adopted them
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.640]   so we started out with that reply
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.640]   you had this group conversation
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   and as the speed of tweets
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   sped up it wasn't always clear
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   who was responding to whom
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.640]   so you put a little @ in to say who you were replying to
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   and Twitter adopted that
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.640]   and made that part of the platform too
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   and what that meant was that
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.640]   but even but then it was still
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   a secondary place
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.640]   your primary stream was
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   the tweet stream you got
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   you had to click a button to go and see the ads
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   they didn't get sent to you on the phone
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.640]   they were just on the website
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   and they were
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   the other thing that Twitter did
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   once they started doing them
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   was that they hid
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.640]   @tweets that started with an @
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.640]   if you weren't following both parties
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.640]   this is really important
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.640]   and that was
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   and we grumbled about it at the time
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   because we said no I like seeing who my friends
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   are talking to
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.640]   but actually it meant that
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   you didn't get with back and forth
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   and it damped it down unless you were actually following them
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.640]   so that was
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   I remember grumbly about it at the time but actually it was a very wise thought
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   because it preserved that sense of
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.640]   the Twitter stream
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.640]   the stuff I've chosen to see and the @ is another place I go and look
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.640]   and they changed that
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.800]   and then the next thing that happened was #
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   now #createanother side channel
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   because if you have a hashtag
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   you are creating a searchable place where people are talking about the same thing
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.800]   and then Twitter made that clickable as well
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.800]   which meant that you could
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   migrate across
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.800]   not just people who were actually trying to talk to you
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   but people who were talking about the same subject
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.800]   so that create another sideways engagement pattern as well
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   and that was
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   again it was users trying to do that
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   and it was a mixture of trying to fill things out
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   and fill things in
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   and it worked
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   and then the thing that happened when Twitter
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   started building
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   first independently we started building mobile apps
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   and other third party apps
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   that would actually feed the app replies
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   and make them more prominent
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   and that was particularly for people who were trying to do
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.800]   like pop-breaking
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   engagement and
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   media type stuff with it
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   or Comcast trying to follow it's
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   being annoyed about it
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   or companies as well
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   but
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.800]   after Twitter
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   decided that they wanted to own the clients
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   and developers weren't supposed to make them anymore
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   they defined how the platform behaved
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   and one of the things they added
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.800]   was these pieces that were
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   not part of that original engagement
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   so one of the nice things about Twitter was it didn't have an inbox
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   it didn't have an unread count
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   you know that we were talking about
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   inbox zero and all that stuff
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   but that little sort of number in the corner that Naxue
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   wasn't there
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   the app didn't have a number on it in the
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   on the phone
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   and it was just like
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   no numbers in red circles
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   and one of the things they changed
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   was that they made
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   app replies be notifications
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   and they also made them
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   the number that is shown on your phone
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   so now suddenly you've got an inbox again
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.800]   and this completely changed the balance of the structure of Twitter from
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   your primary thing is this set of people you're following and paying attention to
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.800]   and the secondary thing of these responses to making the responses the
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   now there were you know there are reasons for them to do this
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   partly it was they're trying to drive engagement
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.800]   they're trying to get people to come back to Twitter and understand it
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.800]   and one of the strongest ways to be engaged is having someone have a conversation with you
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   so that was what drove that
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   but what it means is that the actual valence of Twitter has changed a lot since it started
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   and is now much more of a powerful platform for harassing people
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   for having flame wars and that kind of thing
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.800]   and you know Twitter knows this
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.800]   part of the verification program was a way to
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   insulate the famous people who they're encouraging everyone to
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   follow in their sign up process from this very back and forth process
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   so if you are verified you have extra settings that can
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   say just show me a response from other verified people
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.800]   and you can say you can also say just that
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.800]   other users can sort of dig through and say
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.800]   only show me notifications from people I'm following that's there but it's fairly
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   hidden it's like three levels down in the settings
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   with the verified people it's more obvious and also as part of the verification program
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   they spend time working with the famous people to make their lives easier
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   and so what this what happened is
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   gradually the sort of character of Twitter has changed and it's become much more like
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   blog comments or a public discussion forum or things like that
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   where it's very easy to go and annoy someone
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   and also very easy to cause a sort of cascade pile on and that's where we are now
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   we're now there with with game a gate and with
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   all these other controversies to go back and forth where it's very easy to
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   create a set of people to go and pester each other on Twitter and it makes
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.800]   Twitter feel like a hostile place and it doesn't feel like the place it was
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   because its primary mode is now notification
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.800]   and the notifications are from strangers as opposed to be primarily from people that you chosen to follow
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   so really easy way to throw tomatoes at somebody and
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.800]   and most of the mob by the way the mob thing is big I mean Dr. Drew was here
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   we were talking about this and that's exactly we pointed out he said really
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   the other to understand the human humans love mobs they get sucked into it
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   and mobs don't end until they draw blood and that's what Twitter has become
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   a mob facilitation tool sometimes positively to rear
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   square or the Arab Spring but lately not
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   and it's also it's yeah so the hashtags are a way of creating
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   a group conversation about something and a lot you know they can be jokes
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   but they can be quite powerful things you know yes or women it was a very powerful hashtag
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   that's of course a flood of people's experiences
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   but what Twitter is not good at is understanding
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   the difference of valence between the engagement that is
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   positive and what you want and the engagement that you find abusive
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.800]   and their reporting mechanisms for that are broken
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   the way you report abuse is
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   a multi-stage process spam is one click
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.800]   abuse is an essay question and then you write an essay and it says well if you're not you being abused
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   we're going to ignore you after you've written the essay so people learn not to use it
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   so Twitter is not getting the information they need to distinguish the abusive engagement from the positive engagement
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   and they don't really respond to it it seems like in most cases unless you're a celebrity
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   yeah and so for somebody who
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   creates one of these conversations starts at something that potentially controversial
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   and they find themselves
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   they certainly find themselves in a space called Twitter
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   usable they're phoning beeping ten times a second
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   the the matte client crashes because it has too much data and falls over
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   you can't get to the settings to change it
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.800]   you basically end up having to like go private or leave Twitter
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.800]   and it sort of undermines
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   the basis there and I think part of this is that they are being measured on engagement
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.800]   they're being measured by Wall Street on how much engagement they can get
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   and that's something that they've announced their results this week and they
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   they're stopped went down because apparently they weren't demonstrating enough of that
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   this is a very direct connection isn't there
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.800]   because the money they get the what is advertising led
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   this is a bit like the strategy thing about Google
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   for the brands this they do want this this is that kind of engagement you want
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   you want to start a conversation you want to be able to track everyone and do that
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   but if you do that as an individual you start this it can be overwhelming and the tools aren't there to distinguish the two
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.800]   and I think a lot of brands are overwhelmed too they may say they want it
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.800]   then when it happens they go what the hell well that's yeah that's that's part of it
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   and that can be you know amusing and funny that that that
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.800]   you like when the brand tries to start a conversation about they get all the complaints
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   right but but that you know but it's
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.800]   it's a similar sense of not being able to distinguish
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.800]   these different things but also not having a strong enough signal to do it but it's also
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.800]   the other part of this is and that there's a sort of broader point which is the problem with
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   all of these social experiences is you start out needing more people to talk to
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   so you sign up for the new thing if some people are talking to you don't get what it's for
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.800]   or it just seems empty and that that's definitely the problem Twitter has been new signups
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:39.800]   and they've done work to try and encourage you to follow people but
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.800]   that you know that can exacerbate the problem by getting you just just to follow Kim Kardashian
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   or Justin Bieber or something and so the only interactions you see are not the more
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:51.800]   personal direct ones but these shouting at the broadcast
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   the type interactions um is there a fix
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   um it's not a it's not a simple fix the problem is they they wouldn't
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.800]   need that what I'm saying is that this is a you know it's a gradual
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.800]   change of emphasis but the thing is now that most of people on Twitter
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   haven't been there for seven years like us they don't remember that original feeling
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:15.800]   and they're feeling on Twitter is this I just accidentally
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   kicked the the whole next nest and people are swarming me
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.800]   and you know to the point where that um you know
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.800]   I'm following some of these discussions about building um separate social
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.800]   networks for people who are who are vulnerable to attack and so on um
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.800]   and their focus is all about building block functionality first because that's
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.800]   their that's their experience of Twitter because the experience
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   of having a sort of semi-public
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   a sort of the notion of the notion of semi overlapping
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.800]   publics was something I talked about in my original Twitter thing um 2009
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   which is the idea that we're all publishing different bits of it and seeing different bits
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.800]   of it and that's part of the value of it it doesn't think we don't
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   all see the same way we don't all see the same Twitter but we see different subsets of it
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.800]   and the things move gradually from side to side for that um
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.800]   and it took some work to do that you actually had to repost things or join the conversation
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:15.800]   and spread things initially um and over time it gets more efficient
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:19.800]   and more um you know
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.800]   easier for that to happen and the dangerous you cross the activation
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.840]   point from the I don't know how enough people talk to to have too many people to talk to
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:30.840]   and it's far too easy to go through that hump and it's quite hard to get back from it um and so the
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:34.840]   the attraction of uh L.O. and you know some extent
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:38.840]   attraction of some of the indie web stuff is that we're building another one of these groups
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.360]   where it's still in that early stage and we haven't got to the point where it is too
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.880]   swamping yet although I do have to point out that L.O. very quickly added blocking
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:52.040]   yes it does seem like the first feature you want they're not holding that out that one on premium
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:57.800]   for premium users well I agree 100 with you Kevin I don't know if there's an answer but I think
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:02.440]   that you you nailed it thank you um well one of the things we're doing with um
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:07.160]   indie web is is trying you know one of the things we've built with indie web is is the idea of
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:12.600]   distributed conversation and web mentions so the idea of web mention is that if I mention you
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:17.240]   on my blog post I send you I send your website and note saying I've mentioned you
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:21.560]   um and your website can then display that at the bottom so if you go to like this the post I
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:26.440]   mentioned the Kevin marstercom slash Twitter hate speech you can see all the web mentions at the
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.720]   bottom from people who've discussed it because I've got them hooked up um and it's that that's
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:37.000]   the problem we potentially have is that we will hit the same problem because there isn't a filter
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.720]   in that so the thing we're trying to work out for this um in the web mention in the indie web
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:47.080]   community is what we're calling vouching where the idea would be that when you send a web mention
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:52.200]   the moment that web mention is hi here's my URL I pointed to your URL and then you can go and
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:57.480]   pause it and see that I actually did and decided to display it um and you could apply a whitelist
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.320]   blacklist to that as part of the processing on your site that's up to you or you we don't
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:05.720]   you know define what you're supposed to do with it we've got some tools that help um but we're also
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:11.160]   want to that we're adding a third parameter which is um of what we call in a vouch parameter which says
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:19.320]   if you don't know me um here's a place where here's someone that you link to who has linked to me
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:26.120]   so just trying to say um friend of a friend friend of a friend thing so that but it's actually
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:31.560]   machine passable friend of a friend so you could create a automated whitelist blacklist rule that
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:37.480]   only allows friend of friends in um and that's that this does not seem to be a problem on
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:47.320]   Facebook or Google+ is that why not is it because they're uh recipient controlled because because
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:52.760]   yeah well well Facebook and Google+ have the bidirectional friendship graph rather than the
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:58.520]   unerectional friendship graph that's one part right um you can't you can add people on there
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:04.280]   um but they they are they also they don't have the commitment to showing you the full fee that
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:09.640]   twitter has had right um they are saying we're all we're always filtering your feed we've decided
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:14.600]   what to show you already and we've got a bunch of knobs that we'd adjust to decide what you see
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:18.520]   so with Facebook unless you explicitly go and star people they don't you don't see all their
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:23.720]   posts you only see whatever Facebook decides we're popular or if they have congratulations in or
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.320]   whatever you know there's they've got some bunch of there's a there's a running joke on Facebook if
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:34.360]   you want people to see your posts you start it with congratulations um but the the so they're
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:39.320]   they're already doing high level filtering to decide that now twitter has got bits of this
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:46.280]   the part of the um notification settings in twitter are um they have this uh tailored for me setting
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:53.000]   which is a wonderful piece of opaque tech speak which means uh we will show you some of the things
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.480]   that that are people are at replying you or whatever but not all of them um but it's not clear what
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:03.400]   they're doing there and it's it's not a coherent setting for people to choose um and i don't think
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:07.240]   they have all the signals they need to work out what what's abuse and what isn't though i'm i know
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:11.640]   i'm sure they're trying very hard to try and understand this but without the ability to say
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:17.720]   directly to them this was abusive you've only got the block button that says block everything this
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:22.920]   person ever says in future and even if you do that you know that that's only reactive it is it's
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:29.640]   key you can't say block everyone who is attached to it isn't a friend of mine um you've also got mute
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:34.280]   which will which will do that without informing the person that they've been blocked but both of
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:38.520]   those don't necessarily block um other people retweeting them things like there there's there's
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:43.400]   leakage in all of those um and to some extent there's always going to be some kind of leakage
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:48.680]   in so far and the reason that you know twitter get grumpy about this is they say well people can
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:54.280]   know you can't when you block someone um you you're not hiding your posts from absolutely unless you
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:59.400]   go private because they can always go to the website without logging in and see your posts yeah so
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:05.080]   you know um mark and resistance brought me on twitter for arguing with all that women in tech
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:10.440]   so if i want to read his posts i have to go and go directly to his page and read it um or log in as
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.840]   somebody else and read it um or but i will still see them if somebody else retweets them so i get
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:20.280]   this sort of weird like one piece of a 2020 line post that he's created is that extra tweets
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:26.120]   that i have to go through it any in any one of his tweet stories because you go everywhere you
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:31.640]   never see it all i don't understand why anybody would post anything thoughtful and lengthy on twitter
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:37.160]   as a news storm it's just a strange thing to do um this is everything so he's actually if you
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:43.080]   actually look at them he does it right in that he if you reply to number them you number them and then
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:47.480]   you reply to each subsequent one from the previous one yeah so it will you will get a blue line down
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:52.360]   the side and you can see whether one's hidden because of the numbers so that does work and the value
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.680]   that he claims to get from it is that people can comment on it line by line which is a you know
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.040]   there's something else we've we're trying to hack on on indy web with web web mentioned
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.760]   that'd be a nice feature in indy web yeah yeah but the but the but the point is that
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.720]   i'm i'm straying but the the point is you can't absolutely block people from seeing what you're
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:14.440]   posting if you're posting in public but the the valence of it is you don't necessarily want to
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.080]   block them from you that's that's a nice side effect but you do want to block seeing their
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:24.120]   nonsense and being pursued by their nonsense most of the time and that's the piece that's
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:31.480]   sort of off by default and it's you could the question is could twitter go back to the default
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:36.200]   of not not not notifying you about at replies or tuning that they could they could adjust that
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:42.520]   but i suspect that would do worse things to their engagement um than than they're expecting and also
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:47.320]   that would involve changing a setting which means at the moment that the users would
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.440]   individually have to change that setting or if they changed it globally they'd probably get a
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.680]   um evolve them so they're not kind of sticky place to to try and fix this so i was trying to
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:01.000]   sort of narrate the history of this and try and think it through um for how we design future things
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.200]   but also to understand how we got to this point in the first place that was the that was the
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.240]   point of that person yeah yeah i mean the issue is people harass other people on twitter because
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:15.320]   they know when they at mention that person that the that the subject is going to see that tweet
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.440]   right and and so that the the the person who's being harassed can block the person after the fact
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:26.280]   but the harasser gets the satisfaction that this person saw what i wrote so to take the teeth out of
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:32.680]   that you you know there could ostensibly be a setting that says only show me in my mentions
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:38.120]   column people i know i'm not private but only show me people i know or you know make it so that you
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:43.240]   know someone who i don't know can't address me or be be in my space or you know show up in my
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:49.160]   mentions tab i mean this isn't totally i'm sorry i mean that one that that's a shame isn't it
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:55.240]   wouldn't that be a shame if if if that were the case i mean i i i i i agree with you technically
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.600]   absolutely and so it's a clever view but you know people do just out of nowhere most of the people
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:07.720]   who that mention me out of nowhere are nice decent people yeah definitely but you know it's
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:13.320]   not into the fall to the schmuck i mean absolutely i i agree but you know what at some point i was
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.920]   getting so many out mentions that i set my mobile twitter client to only notify me like only send me
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:23.000]   a push notification if it's some if it's one of my friends who mentions me right like that i want
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   to see right the others i'll just i'll get later in my mentions tab you know what i mean and that's
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.600]   and that's something i not everybody has this problem a privilege right and there's a problem i
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:35.000]   have because i have a lot of followers because of twig and because of life hacker but it does feel
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.160]   like oh this person's not going to get into my mental space you know unless i've whitelisted them
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:44.040]   i mean and and and i and this is what you you are you are advocating for this to some degree in last
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:50.120]   week's discussion of of email i agree with you i'm just i'm just lamenting that that you know for
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:56.440]   you said last week and what heaven has just said um heaven's demurgatory and what's become of twitter
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:02.440]   right right but that's the thing is it's been a gradual change the setting you have this is
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.720]   like four levels deep in the settings is you have tailored for you from anyone or off that's no
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:13.080]   dimensions and photo tags um and the problem is there isn't a just some people i know there now i
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.320]   think if you're verified one of you guys is verified i think i'm verified i think we're all
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:22.040]   verified right oh yeah okay i think you get a different setting there um i think you get from
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:28.520]   from verified people as well as i have have a look and see um but so they're they're a different i
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:35.320]   don't want to go to twitter well just do it on i did it on the phone because i don't want to look at
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:42.600]   twitter you do have some really terrible people Leo
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:48.280]   notice how many other how many notifications in this list and these have been incrementing
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.840]   out of it over time and this is four levels deep in this i've had to click you have to know to click
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:57.160]   your account and then notifications it looks like a single parameter setting and then underneath
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:04.040]   is this and there's a set that seems to turn off and news and other and what are these things i
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.240]   turn them all on this device because it's not my phone so i want to see what they all are
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:11.160]   or my phone i've had to turn a lot of them off and there's this i get weird ones which is
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:17.160]   random person has just joined twitter why don't you welcome them i know i hate that right
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.480]   and that's true that's one that's one of the others and the point is you know they're trying
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:26.840]   really really hard to drive engagement and and encouraging to that and which means they've got a
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:33.080]   large team of people who are growing the ways of making it more engaging um and they're they're
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.200]   sort of um kelyn put this very well once he said you're in asymmetric warfare with yourself
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:43.000]   the point where you're trying to sort of make people's um experience better while you're also
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.480]   trying to improve your sign up experience and all the suggestion and flow means that every time
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.360]   you improve blocking unless you also make it hard to make a new account you're you're you're
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:57.080]   stuck because and they'll just go away and create new accounts to harass you with or write bots to
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:01.880]   do it and retweet them so it's a it's a it's i'm not saying it's an easy problem i'm saying it's
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:06.600]   i'm saying it's a hard problem and it's a structural problem with with a medium um because it's
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.880]   it's you know systemically you do want at that point where you don't have anyone to talk to you
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:17.320]   do want to gain people um and then at some point you cross over to this place where every time you
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.520]   touch it there's something that just makes you back away from it again um and it's very hard to
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:28.040]   get that sweet spot in the middle and i think they they sort of stumbled into getting that right
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:33.560]   initially because of the following model um and because there was there was some resistance there
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:39.000]   right um but in turn in this you know in the in the last three years where they've been trying to
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.440]   ramp up engagement um they've got the they've got they've sort of gradually lost the the folk memory
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:51.320]   of that as the number of users who've joined have not had that experience but also the employees
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.200]   have not had that experience a lot of people who work at Twitter now weren't around on Twitter you
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:01.320]   know in that in that period and don't have that folk memory of it being that kind of place
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.920]   and assume this is just what it's like yeah it's not and that's but this this always happened i mean
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:11.560]   in uh we just sound like old farts the well was really great remember how great the well used to be
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:19.480]   well yeah it does to some extent this is it it's a separate service yeah or copy serve or whatever
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.520]   it seems like all social networks eventually descend to this and then you just have to move on
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.720]   well that's that's a really interesting that's the big issue we need to leave it was long
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.160]   yeah they named that leo's law see how long that last
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:36.040]   i think this is part of the thing with email as well i mean you know
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:42.120]   if you're my age you've been using email for 20 something years um and you remember when it was
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.680]   the place where um the only thing you ever saw in your inbox was was helpful things and people
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.560]   you're excited to hear from or someone who'd found you somewhere um through some complicated
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.280]   process and was asking you an interesting question and it was it was a what i'm excited when you heard
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:02.760]   you got mail right yeah yeah and you know you you use it it's the same use if you go back you know
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:07.160]   30 years um use net was like that use net was a place where you can have these public conversations
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:12.120]   and you could assume but the by default that anyone who's who'd found their way into their um
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:16.920]   initially was at the university or was was associated with it was that was part of the filter in the
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:22.040]   same way that that was early facebook filter um and that the conversation was good and it was
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:27.160]   you know cancer and seagull inventing spam and deciding to post their green card lottery nonsense
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:32.760]   to every use group on use net that sort of opened the floodgates there um because it was a you know
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:39.160]   it was a deliberate exploitation of this public resource and that the the you know blog comments
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.120]   is the same 10 years later it's like initially we were just posting comments to each other and then
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.040]   eventually people started using it to harass people and then the bots turned up and started
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:54.360]   spamming everything um and it's it is this sort of structural problem of of how you build these
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:59.320]   things in a way that are resilient to this but are still capable of growing and that that is okay
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.120]   okay okay i'm gonna go back to the thing i always say at this moment what are the two things where
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:11.000]   i'm i'm on a channel like elgin right now what's troll proof he argues that it's google plus and
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.680]   facebook to some extent why because the user has more the the recipient has more control yeah you
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:22.520]   know what though i i am there i am now getting every single day in my google plus the same guy
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:28.280]   spamming a bunch of price a price list he's putting it in all my community it's not me he's just he's
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:33.720]   just doing it i block and spam him every single time and there's no disincentive for him to come back
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:39.880]   the i believe fully that it isn't the tools that google plus offers you it's that it's new and is
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:46.680]   it could be it's just a matter of time i i will stand by leo's law i think it's a bit of both i think
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:53.320]   that they it's not just that it's new um i think there was a tendency for things to go in this way
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:59.320]   and and it is you know it is harding strategy of the commons or whatever but the the tragedy of
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:06.040]   commons was somewhat mythical because um people do find rules to actually govern commons um and
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.040]   that was the you know that was if you actually look at the literature of this the tragedy of the
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:14.360]   commons was a thread with him actually people have managed common land very productively for thousands
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.920]   of years because they come up with rulesets that that meant you didn't overgraz them um and the
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:25.080]   challenge for us is is is the same thing of building these you know systemic structures rules of
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:30.680]   engagement that means that we can have a common space that that that doesn't get overgrazed or
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.720]   doesn't get overrun and and this is not straightforward this is hard and it is very hard to do it with
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.560]   mechanical rules you do need people the other article this week that was fascinating um
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:45.720]   which was i i can't remember where i read it but you've probably seen it was the um the the long
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:51.160]   article about all the people who are employed to take the nasty stuff yeah social facepook
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:56.200]   those poor sad people i think it was on the times those poor sad people who have the worst job in
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:02.760]   the world and it's like you know in half half of half of facebook employees by by number of
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.080]   employees you know they're indirect employees are people in the philippines who are trying to to
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:13.720]   to um stop you seeing decapitations and and disgusting things by by blocking them the article is on
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:18.520]   the wire the laborers who keep dick pics and beheadings out of your facebook feed and a picture
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:25.400]   tells it all a poor contractor malilla who's just hiding her head from the can you imagine the
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:31.480]   horrific stuff they have to see i don't know how matt cuts maintains his yeah matt tests to do this
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.720]   sunny personality given given the stuff we've asked him that haven't we
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:44.760]   stage his files yeah well but he's not you know he's he's got like lazz before he's not on the ground
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.800]   level anymore he probably doesn't see the grossest stuff right right i mean that's because the
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.000]   product talks about all the you know this is lots of people get hired and burn out from this very
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.320]   quickly because it is it is very distressing well it's like being a cop frankly i don't think i
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.560]   could be a police officer either especially in a major metropolitan imagine the you know the
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:11.240]   horrible depressing things you would see thank god somebody's willing to do it
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:17.240]   all right we're gonna take a break when we come back i want to cheer things up because we've got a

[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.000]   phone right now
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.640]   oh yeah pretty much yeah Jason knows what this is all about i tried everything
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:46.760]   and i was clicking the browser so it's doing full reloads i did i did on my chrome book in case
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:53.480]   they'd favor me for that smart that's smart really overthought it
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:17:02.120]   jina what's new from google well google has released the google fit app it's now available
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:07.240]   on google play i love it and google calls it a comprehensive view of your fitness so
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.880]   install the google fit app it's you carry your phone and you get access to walking running and
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.520]   cycling activity these are all the new android apis we saw around music around movement and
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:21.160]   detecting if you're you know walking running or driving showing up you can set and reach goals
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:26.360]   based on duration or the number of steps you've made or or see your progress throughout the day
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:32.600]   i just installed it today actually and it's the initial goal that i was tasked with reaching was
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:37.800]   an hour of movement per day pretty good and you can get performance based recommendations for
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:43.640]   activity goals and the sdk for google fits has been released this is what i'm really interested in
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:49.160]   this will allow fitness apps to connect to google fit and for you to see all your data in one place
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:54.680]   so some devices and apps are already working strava we things run tastic runkeeper and newm
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.520]   coach work right now and i'm sure that we're going to see we're going to see more
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:03.240]   and the idea is that google fit will surface all the all the data from those collected by those
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:08.440]   apps into into one place to kind of get that that bird's eye view of your fitness and from what i
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.240]   understand and i haven't had a chance to do a whole lot of testing with this because i was
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:16.200]   unfortunately sitting at a desk most of the day um is that it you know connects to of course your
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:21.080]   android wear watch and all that data kind of shows up shows up in one place so leo have you
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.160]   have you played with it much it looks like you you have to have it connected to the watch yet so
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.240]   as you can see i'm because if you don't connect to the watches you have to keep your phone like in
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:34.520]   your pocket so you see your steps yeah right let me connect it to the watch i've been using you know
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:40.840]   the the um this is a galaxy note of course there's a samsung s fit same idea s health is the same idea
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.320]   let me see if i can um if i can uh connect it to the phone because that maybe i have to do it through
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:50.120]   the connect app i'm not sure but that would be not or through the watch that would be nice if it would
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:54.280]   yeah but i have to do it on here because then it would uh then it because the watch i always have
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:59.800]   on the watch would become a fitness band right right so let's see it's fit yeah show me my steps fit
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.880]   so it should be uh it should be connected there from the watch yeah it should be
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:09.160]   collected collecting from the watch so yeah i i didn't i didn't do any setup and i think i think that the
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:16.200]   the app on the phone did get my steps from the watch yeah i don't might not i set it up but i'm not
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.040]   unless i i really haven't uh but you know what it might be accurate
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:28.920]   i have only taken a thousand steps in my defense in my defense i rode for 10 minutes
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.200]   did the treadmill for half an hour and lifted weights for half an hour today
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:38.040]   but the problem is none of these things ever count real exercise it's just walking around
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:43.000]   and running that's all they can right although ron ron on all the android last night said that he
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:49.400]   was at a concert and kind of you know you know boppin to the beat that would count maybe not
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.920]   boppin but then he got a notification on his watch saying hey you've hit your step goal today
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:20:00.440]   yeah i've had that happen that's nice that's a good feeling yeah so yeah you hit or miss uh let's
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:07.160]   see what else we got oh uh google plus in celebration of halloween let's you add spooky effects to your
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:15.000]   photos so if you go to g.co/halloweenify you'll get the option to add a fun effect or a spooky effect
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   you choose one of your photos um i tried it out yeah makes your kid look like a zombie basically
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.960]   oh no no no look at mine i got a really i got a really good one let me see here this is uh this
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:31.080]   is mine happy happy when it's shared private women i clicked something wrong here go back to the front
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:39.880]   and oh i shared it privately i got to share it publicly no wonder no one's commented on it
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:45.080]   yeah don't you love when that happens yeah it's pretty it's pretty scary just look at it
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:53.480]   it finds your face as usual they're very good at this kind of stuff finds your face but there's
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:01.400]   that's the spooky one there's also like a fun one yeah cat faces yeah yeah i'll share this publicly
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:08.520]   cool that's a good one it finds more than one face i've got one with two faces are cool let me
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:15.320]   be sure to be turning i like it uh google launches the official youtube app for playstation 4 with
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:21.160]   1080p viewing and gameplay sharing so you can download the app for free via the playstation store and um
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:26.760]   get features that youtubers gamers like it the new app will allow gamers to share gameplay
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:33.000]   directly to youtube um you'll be utilizing the share button on the dual shock 4 control oh that's
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.120]   sweet yeah yeah with the ps4 youtube app you can also view videos and up to 1080p quality 5.1 channel
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:48.680]   audio that's a shot across the bow of twitch yes it is it is it's supposed to be faster and smoother
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:53.480]   as well so um you can do that with twitch on the playstation and xbox but
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:59.240]   now you can do it with youtube which has a little bit bigger audience i think yeah yep it's true
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:06.120]   and finally google updates it's official analytics app with ipad support so there's an
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:10.840]   iphone app i an app you can run your iphone or ipad touch to check your google analytics for your
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:16.600]   website you can now uh do it on the ipad and the new app update of course takes advantage of the
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:22.920]   screen real estate on the ipads you can see more charts uh in in view than usual and you can get
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:28.600]   that in the ios app store and that's all i got that's the google changelong
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:35.960]   ooh you could do some spooky stuff with this
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:44.040]   spooking out their photos spooky i like it i love auto awesome stuff i'm such a sucker for
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:50.440]   you know that stuff so uh interesting article nick built-in uh writing in the new york times
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:23:01.800]   mr. Nice at facebook um his name is artole behar and he has the job of teaching the sites users
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:11.640]   particularly its teenagers how to be respectful to one another and i really liked this um he is
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:16.360]   director of engineering for the facebook protect and care team there are 80 people on that team
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:22.200]   he says most users are not trying to be mean and will retract a comment and even feel bad about it
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.480]   if they realize it caused someone harm you might have seen on facebook if you see a picture of you
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:32.840]   or a comment on your stream that you didn't like there's a button that you can click effect i
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:37.720]   should do it let me let me complain about something i'm so good at this i don't know if this is
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:43.720]   enabled for everyone i feel like well i don't get all the features okay so i think if you're a
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:49.560]   teenager you might get all the features but let me um let me find a picture of me first
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:57.720]   pictures of you and let's say here's a picture of me let's say for reasons i couldn't understand i
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:07.720]   didn't like this picture of me um whoops let's go back to it i think i can complain about it i go
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:16.360]   to options and is it report photo i guess it is okay help us understand the problem why don't
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:20.920]   you want to see this photo it's annoying or not interesting i'm in i'm in this photo and i don't
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:27.480]   like it okay click continue why don't you like it what's a bad photo of me it's inappropriate it
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:34.520]   makes me sad it's embarrassing i'm gonna say it makes me sad well you know what and i love this
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:40.840]   the best way to delete this photo is to send a note to the person who posted it and tell him
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:48.520]   why now this is not the prose that nik reported in his article this the pre-fills this one with hey
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:53.720]   i don't like this photo please take it down but if you're a teenager you might get some different
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:01.240]   phraseology so facebook has started giving users a list of emotions like embarrassing to say
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:05.560]   why you want it removed you know tell you know my normal reaction i think teenager
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:10.840]   normal reaction would be to go if you get rid of that you ask but or maybe even that sounded i
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:16.200]   sounded like jeff for a moment there but you're a child you're a child you're a child you're a
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:23.960]   they say face when facebook in early versions of the feature only 20 percent of teenagers filled
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:30.120]   out the form when facebook added more district descriptive language like feelings and sadness
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:36.120]   the figure grew to 80 percent we've played around with having pre-populated messages
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:40.840]   versus no message at all if kids are given a blank box oftentimes they're going to say things
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:45.720]   that are not going to be helpful including cursing at their friends when facebook offered
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:53.000]   more developed responses like this post is mean it makes me feel sad and i don't want it on facebook
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:26:01.560]   85 percent of teenagers who wanted a post removed sent the message and what i think is very interesting
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:05.720]   is it's not merely that they want people to be more civil i think they're trying to teach
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:11.880]   younger users emotional intelligence yeah i mean this is mindfulness right like this is like
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:17.080]   someone else's articulated your feelings and you're like yeah that's it and it works they go yeah i
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:24.760]   i do feel sad that is what i look at is that great it's pretty great
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:31.080]   we're not you know maybe we're not teaching our kids because i know we're not that good at it as
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:37.800]   an adult i'm very bad at it how to respond in this kind of mindful way sometimes i think what would
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:44.120]   the die-lilama say up yours you bozo in the heat of the moment when you're overcome with emotion and
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.280]   you feel attacked you feel vulnerable which we we often do when someone says something or post
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:52.680]   something about us that we don't like you know it's it's it's very difficult to have a kind of
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.600]   distance and perspective and you know therapists always say use i words tell us how you feel about
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:04.600]   something not you know criticize the other person say how it makes you feel and that's what they're
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:09.320]   doing yeah this post is mean yeah it's interesting right and it's criticizing the post and it makes
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:18.360]   me feel sad i don't want it on facebook is that good ah i'm gonna carry for your inner child yeah
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:25.160]   so um when facebook asked people why they shared a post that hurt someone else this is also interesting
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:30.440]   90 percent of respondents said they thought their friends would like the post or would find it funny
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:37.000]   only two percent wanted to provoke or alarm someone else well come on maybe they're not admitting it
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.680]   yeah i have to think something i think though there's some truth in that i think that
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:48.200]   digital media do not communicate nuance as we know this very well and lo's
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.440]   lo jokes are often lost in translation on twitter and on facebook right
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.320]   i'm not sure i disagree with this
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:03.720]   they one of the reasons you see stickers now they say is because they're trying to put facial
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:09.640]   expressions on stickers so another way to help you express feelings and be more empathetic
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:16.600]   next they're going to experiment with sounds imagine sending someone the sound of a grunt
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.840]   sigh or a giggle to communicate your feelings about a post
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:26.840]   i think this is great the part will be very popular
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:33.640]   that when this is the point about about phatic is is that the meaning of phatic is it
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.960]   farther back to phatic no phatting
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:46.600]   phatic is um and i looked it up it is phatic um ae how do you pronounce ae ah all right it's
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:55.720]   phonetically ae that it leaded ae so the the the is that it is um a communication that the
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:01.640]   word is not there for meaning but for emotional communication so when you say
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:07.720]   how are you you're not saying tell me your medical history you're saying i care about you
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.760]   phatic um
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:14.040]   phatic
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.480]   phatic
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:21.880]   this reminds me of that story um the the facebook comment that ruined a life i put it on the
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:27.240]   rundown right below the the the mr nice story but it was about that that teenager that posted
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:34.280]   really badly executed joke about shooting up at kindergarten oh god yeah it went and went to
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:40.200]   went to prison and suffered like extreme abuse in prison and it was a joke yeah yeah
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:48.200]   um which is just an unbelievable story in every single way um but yeah it's it's interesting
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:53.240]   you know we we built these communications mechanisms and you know that that that aren't
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:56.840]   face to face and now we have to sort of make them as face to face as we can possibly make them so
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:04.840]   that humans act like humans that's why i do really think sounds like size are great idea and stickers
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:12.680]   so you see people's faces this is quite a story and and we'll really depress you so
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:18.040]   yes all right i didn't mean to be a downer yeah and it's old news but it just reminded me of that
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:28.360]   and that was that was very distressing because um it was you know he did say something very stupid
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:34.360]   and and you know but it was and and and it was a totally conversation with a friend
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.880]   on and you and you read it on the face of it it's all in caps and it's horrific
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.360]   because text doesn't communicate any nuance you don't get the sense of what he was what his you
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.840]   know you don't see this you know tilt of the head of the smile it's sad
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:59.400]   anyway that's that's that's nice to me shoots right right report if you want
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.640]   all right let's get some lights with we you know what this show needs more of
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:11.160]   light so you should threat jeff javis all right real quick easy to chill his phonetic
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:18.120]   last week basically the publisher is lost they got kicked out of the cartel office what
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:23.400]   the publisher except for three cases gave up uh but it's not a happy ending yet they basically gave up
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:32.280]   and uh google pulled down the snippets only for develt and three small uh uh built brands not
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:39.880]   mean much and not much else so that would seem like a victory uh-huh no because tomorrow or this
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:48.440]   week spain is going to vote on the link tax and it's going to pass plus the he had new head uh
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:56.120]   eu head of uh digital with your family hootinger talked about uh coming up with a a uy like
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:32:00.680]   students should correct so this is whack-a-mole it's not over i didn't want to bore you forever
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:05.240]   but i wanted to get that quick report in and especially it's the reason i chose to come speak
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:13.880]   here in spain is because i wanted to argue about uh how the link tax is wrong 20 years ago this month
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:22.680]   the commercial browser was was was introduced and now spain is voting to kill the link and thus
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:29.880]   the web so take that's it how do you say light some fusrek lights doing a short space
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:37.640]   spanish i was wondering that i knew you'd ask that
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.040]   google translate right
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:44.040]   try link tax in spanish
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:50.520]   thank you hanis schleff
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:57.400]   schleff for that light song should strike the moment
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:32:59.400]   schleff
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:02.200]   schleff
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:02.760]   schleff
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:07.160]   um i think we i think we've said everything that need to be said any anybody want to throw
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:14.120]   anything in here before we go to our picks of the week um let me open things uh i just
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:19.400]   gmail messages showing up in google searches that's weird
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:24.600]   that is pretty hard but it's only the messages you wrote in your search results
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:31.240]   it's still gonna freak people out i know yeah yeah definitely yeah do we care about the fire stick
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:45.320]   or fire
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:51.880]   homecast thirty nine dollars and if you're a prime member nineteen dollars it's an eight
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.640]   that sale is over at this point you missed it yep you missed it it was a four to eight
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.600]   hour deal and so the next is six and that gone
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:05.800]   gotta pay more attention i didn't pull the trigger on that damn i don't want it it's just
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.200]   another thing you're plugging your tv it's got an htmi port pretty soon you're gonna be able to
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:15.160]   get a fire phone for thirty nine dollars i know now the fire tv which is ninety nine dollars and
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:19.560]   the fire stick are i think functionally almost identical they don't have obviously the voice
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:24.600]   search you do get a dedicated remote you get there is voice search with this there is
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:30.680]   mm-hmm you say what you want and where do you say it into the remote yep i guess you say it to the
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:36.360]   remote yeah oh yeah not bad huh and the fire phone is above oh wait a minute no no no no
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.560]   simply say what you want to watch it start enjoying it seconds with the free app or amazon
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.600]   fire tv voice remote sold separately uh so the so the remote that comes with the
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:51.400]   discussion doesn't know there's no there's no mic in that remote but you could use your app on
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:57.400]   your phone so there's an app where i guess i should get this i still have a hooked up my fire tv
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.120]   so what do i need this for it's the same basically right do you have the gaming
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:09.240]   you get Netflix amazon of course hulu plus crackle amazon music i art radio spotify
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:18.200]   there seem like there was much gaming going on there flappy birds tetris pba bowling challenge
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:25.320]   sonic the hedgehog too that's pretty good you don't know jack so yeah that's kind of i mean the
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:31.560]   price is what's interesting about this yeah thirty nine bucks and if you apparently were on the stick
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:40.440]   you'd have gotten for nineteen and does it has all the family stuff to the uh kids yeah has the kid
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:48.760]   stuff so all you need is the phone the fire tv remote app which does not require a fire phone
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:56.680]   thank god you know what's not on here it's interesting is are the two new music streamers
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:04.360]   that are streaming uncompressed cd quality sound and the sonos offers those and that's kind of uh
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:11.640]   intriguing um they're twenty bucks a month though and the trend for streaming music like
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:19.320]   spotify and beat seems to be going down not not end google music not up to five dollars seems to be
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:26.600]   the the bottom oh there is one other story that actually might affect us uh mikersoft today and
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:34.280]   asked that they're going to offer unlimited one drive storage if you buy a uh office office 365
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:39.640]   subscription which is as little as seventy dollars a year unlimited not one terabyte not five terabytes
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:49.720]   unlimited hmm i happen to have an office 365 subscription so i immediately signed up so
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:53.640]   can you hot link are you gonna host your shows there now i think we should
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:37:00.680]   now they want one drive now uncompressed hd video
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:10.040]   it's not the size it's the bandwidth it gets yeah that's what she said so uh anyway i but i what i
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.200]   think is interesting about this is that i this is very competitive space google started it by
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:21.000]   dropping the price of google drive storage to almost nothing and uh and mikersoft's competing
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.760]   amazon's competing will drop box is the one caught with a squeeze i think right because it's their
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.240]   only business and they can't subsidize it yeah right but the advantage they have is that they are
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:35.000]   actually truly cross platform whereas everyone else has got some kind of place where it's hard
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.560]   for them to do it i put one drive on my uh android phone and it will do the automatic upload thing
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:45.960]   just like everybody else does of pictures and documents and it seems to work pretty well
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:51.400]   apparently uh mary jofoli was saying that uh office for android is imminent
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:57.240]   so uh yeah so if that's you know an office for the ipad's pretty sweet
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:03.160]   so office for android comes out you've got the automatic photo backup i don't know this is a
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:09.560]   little bit of a competitor i spent i spent a bit of time trying with office 365 and that's office
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:15.320]   for the desktop by the way last half of the world but the but they have a web based office which is
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.400]   which is good i thought is that the web based edit
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:23.160]   yeah the web based stuff is good and it feels like feels like dogs but if you actually try and
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:27.720]   use the apps you suddenly start with locking and whoever's got it open nobody else can touch it and
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:32.120]   you get it all gets confusing again right so it's it's interesting so that they've
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:37.560]   they've managed to fix the website of it and get quite good at that but they're still stuck with
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:43.960]   the native apps on on windows and mac where the app doesn't have a concept of two people editing
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:48.680]   at once so it feels like source code control from 15 years ago you have to check out the file and
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.280]   anyone who's touched it means nobody else can touch it and you still have to merge it
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.360]   whereas the web based side of it and i think the iphone side of it they it has that google
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:01.000]   doxy feel to it so it's it's interesting that that you know that they're they're keeping the
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.160]   legacy apps because that's the yeah that's the thing people are used to but they're having to sort
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:10.920]   of work really hard to do that well and what's neat is that uh office uh the office dot com apps
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:18.680]   work on a Chromebook they work on a Mac and they're good i mean i suppose there's stuff missing
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:25.240]   i'm sure there is but it's pretty amazing in html5 browser you've got you know a office
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:32.200]   for free yeah and i think the value is people who really really like it so spreadsheets right
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:37.080]   yes because that word processing is pretty straightforward it's excel it's the unique
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:41.800]   yeah i agree well actually the word the other the people who really love word and lawyers who
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:47.560]   who really like track changes because no one's right um taught them about git yet um and merging
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:52.360]   so that they they their sort of workflow is all in that like that the only time i have to use
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:56.520]   word these days is when i have a legal document that i have to say changes to and i have to go into
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:02.600]   their workflow for a bit that's right that's right baby all right let's take a break when we come
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:09.320]   back we are going to get your picks of the week so everybody prepare right now i'm gonna prepare
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:15.880]   for Betty by time i'm putting on my jammies because i got my new kasper mattress i don't know if you've
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:19.880]   ever gone mattress shopping of course you have who has it if you're grown up you've been mattress
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:25.160]   shopping and it's kind of crazy to think that you could go to a mattress store middle of the day
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:30.920]   lie on a bed with your clothes on looking up at the ceiling and the and the sales lady staring at you
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:34.840]   and think that you could in any way judge whether that bed is right for you you can't
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:40.600]   kasper kind of counterintuitively sells mattresses online you might say well
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:45.880]   then i really can't try it oh no no that's what's great about this you have a hundred days
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:54.360]   to try it you can free delivery painless returns within a hundred day period so if you don't like
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:58.760]   it after three months no problem they'll come and get it here's our casper mattress this is a queen
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:04.760]   size mattress that came in a box the size of a small child i know because after the mattress was
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.240]   out the small child got in the box and started playing with it's a wonderful box uh this is the
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.880]   mattress they give you a nice little tool it's wrapped in tivak by the way no out gassing it does
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.680]   not have any odor it smells great uh you and the reason i mentioned that is because it's a latex
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:22.920]   mattress with memory foam on the top and you might say well it smells great and look at this it's
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:29.720]   oh which comfortable oh it's i don't know how they do it it's soft on top and firm in the back it's
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:36.360]   just what you want in my opinion it's it's firm but so
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:43.400]   aussie even loved it and uh it's great for a great night's sleep but you do get to try it off also
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:49.720]   it sleeps cool which is really nice casper is an online retailer premium mattresses for a fraction
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:54.920]   of the cost we're talking 500 bucks for a twin 950 dollars all the way up to the biggest size the
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:42:01.240]   king size and you'll save an additional 50 bucks even aussie likes it because one of our audience

[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:28.280]   javascript enabled pacman game that you could play yeah well if you google pacman you will get a
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:32.440]   search result a card in your search results with the full game click to play wait a minute you're
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:38.200]   kidding just in search results yeah in the search results oh wait i gotta try this oh that's oh what
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:45.320]   you do yep that's hysterical the the doodle and you can play so i apologize for rehashing
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:50.680]   the pacman game from 2010 but i i didn't realize it was right there in the search results you could
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:55.320]   play pacman anytime come on now that is a knowledge graph i could live with
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:03.800]   wow that is awesome as you can see i suck at pacman oh just the sound of it just it does come back
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:13.960]   doesn't it yeah oh man oh this was the game it looks too wide it's a wide screen it's a
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:19.960]   white man it's the google board but what's interesting they must have a license this
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:23.720]   google book but you yes they must have licensed this from an amco because it's got the whole
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:29.080]   yeah the whole thing yeah it sounds and everything the whole look yeah exactly

[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:47.480]   yes i know if i could have told my eight-year-old self that someday i could just hype pacman
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:51.960]   and google and play pacman anytime i wanted i think i would have i would have plots i don't even know
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:45:00.040]   what i would have done they're saying that all the google uh doodle games will work this way oh really
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:06.120]   so we've got to try some others uh did you hangman at some point they have a lot of games i think

[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:28.520]   frogger it's search for frogger so it had to have been a doodle game yeah that's what that's what
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:33.960]   everybody's saying yeah defender didn't they had doodle fender they did do the fender at one time
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:41.080]   but maybe it doesn't work with all the games pretty sure asteroids now see now this is my

[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.320]   no it's parents only pacman sorry i've read some great articles this week which i probably have
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:28.280]   lost but um there were interviewing people who who used to work for atari i think it was the
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:32.840]   the first female game programmer yes we try we actually had booked her on triangulation i'm
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:38.280]   trying to get her on yeah and i really wrote what did she write she wrote uh centipede i think so
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.880]   i i can't remember but it was like yes we had 128 bytes of ram to work with
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:50.920]   bytes bytes not kilobytes i'm listening to uh walter isex's brand history is that good

[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:43.960]   let's get a tip from mccammon i think you have one i've finally got i've actually got three but let
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:50.120]   that's um fire away let me let me go through this so i just got told by bear about this if you go to
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:56.120]   the internet archive they have emulators for old games so if you go archive the org slash
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:01.320]   details slash console living room they will have have emulated the games there and they're actually
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:06.200]   um trying to work their way through all the different um things and they have javascript based
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:10.600]   um virtual machines that that run the game ROMs things like that there's one of the projects
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:14.760]   they're doing and they're starting to try and do this with um cd ROMs and things as well they get
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:20.520]   they're gathering though so their goal is that um by using emulation they'll be able to you
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:26.680]   ought to play back some of these these games so yeah someone's out on frog i got frog or uh
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:32.920]   but how do i how do i move but this is this is this is not the frog a machine this is like the
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:38.600]   Atari 800 playing from oh i need a joystick of a spectrum machine oh yeah 2,600 yeah yes
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:45.640]   3,600 so that they they're there there is there are there is multi-opc machine emulator which um
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:51.240]   actually plays real ROMs from games but yeah but then you got to go and find um ROMs which are
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:55.000]   not circulated because they're um they're coppered by the companies they're that's that's harder but
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.960]   but the point the point of the internet archive is that they're trying to preserve everything
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:03.960]   um so i i was inspired by that by two things today one was the internet archive has finally
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:11.480]   changed their um UI so um if you go to internet i think you have to actually go to a
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:17.720]   through a link how internet archive.org archive.org slash new or something i don't know if i'm
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:23.080]   trying to find where it is if this goes sega i'm gonna go crazy
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:32.680]   archive.org slash v2 so if you do archivore slash v2 you get a new um 2014 hell get everything
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:39.960]   there um UI to the internet archive oh it looks pretty and modern and has like that interest
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:44.760]   pinterest tidy thing going on but it's still got the round corners but much more images um
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:51.160]   so that inspired me um to go back and look up my first website so i did a um
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:56.120]   post i'm playing this on the web by the way this is in a browser it is the
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:02.600]   yes unbelievable this is the point this is this is the you can do everything in javascript
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:06.920]   thing it's so yeah it's basically they're using asm.js and they're compiling the emulators into
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:11.800]   javascript so they don't rewrite the code they actually are emulating it yeah yeah um
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:18.440]   so layers of emulation so um it's the 45th anniversary of the arpanet today
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:25.480]   happy anniversary and it's the 20th anniversary of the duri 3c and there's a big gala performance
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:32.360]   going on in san taklara this afternoon um at um and i link that from my post so i i this made me
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:39.480]   go back and say what was let me see if i can find my first web page oh look at this i went back
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:44.760]   and found my first web page which was from 1995 i'm not exactly sure where in 1995
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.000]   because this was on my company's home page that i was working for at the time it was a
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:57.960]   emm mrscorp.com/tilda kevin marks um and i posted photographs of my son after he was born in 1995
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:02.040]   and then didn't touch the page with two years um but that was just long enough for it to get into
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:09.320]   internet archive and which started crawling in in 97 and now he's in college and now he's in college
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:16.760]   yes um wow so so but the the thing so so like i was actually pleased that i could find that and
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:20.440]   i got away with it by i by didn't have the internet archive because a lot of people
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:27.240]   lost the first web page partly because um companies shut down and deleted them yeah um and part and
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:33.000]   the internet archive didn't start crawling until 97 and so if he was if it and they didn't manage
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.080]   to catch it then it would go they'd go away and go on but i was what you want is the way back machine
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:45.560]   and you need to remember your old url right yes mine was uh slash tilda loport i think well i
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:51.240]   looked up emmcorp.com which was the the company website um actually look at that that's quite
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:54.040]   a there's quite a thing in its own right so you have to go back to 96 to look at it because
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:52:00.040]   somebody else bought it after we shut down yeah um all right name so this no i'm looking at my old
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:07.240]   i'm just screw you i'm trying to find my say for trying to find my say i think it you see it's uh
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:15.000]   okay so what's which one should i look at um mmcorp.com okay just the whole thing
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:21.080]   yeah oh there's a lot i'll go back to 96 because somebody else bought it afterwards no 96 has
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:28.040]   nothing 97 is the first one yeah february 20th 1997 ladies gentlemen and that's just i love the
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:34.040]   i just love the retro design of this man we thought this was cool this was that was a bit
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:38.200]   this was pretty this is because it's a nice thing cool in 97 anything that moved on the web
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:42.360]   yeah it's a good thing to think real stuff like that it's kind of cool anyway so buried somewhere
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:46.200]   three levels down and that was my original site which i've now dug out and preserved
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:50.760]   which is pictures of me and my son so that was that was my i think everyone should should go
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:57.800]   go and share my first web page on twitter the hashtag my first website uh what did i do my first
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:02.920]   web page i did page okay because it was really just a page could i just search for my name or do you
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:09.960]   have to search for url if you search for url so you have to know where it was yeah crl.com maybe it
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:14.600]   was slash tilde leo loport maybe slash tilde leo ville
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:23.880]   hmm nope it's fun though to to play with it and so it they started in 95
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:32.280]   we're back at any url they started calling it late 96 but they weren't doing very comprehensive
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:35.960]   it's basically based on the the elixir search engine was the original stuff before they started
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:40.920]   calling on their own and i'm not sure i'll comprehend so that the early years of the crawler but they've
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:45.320]   got better over time and now the other thing the other tip is that you can now actually tell it
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:50.760]   to go and crawl something which is handy you can say i just posted this thing go crawl it
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:54.600]   but you can also say i just linked to this thing go crawl it and that means that if the thing goes
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:54:00.600]   away at least they've got a copy too fairly neat um but the actually the actual app tip i have
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:06.760]   and this is what i'm sure this is an app you've seen before is is plex.tv you know plex
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:13.720]   which is basically it's you run it on your machine at home and it's a principle server for all your
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:18.520]   local media but the thing that i found is they now have very good chrome car support
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:26.520]   so you set up the plex server at home and then you use your phone to serve the audio and video you
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:32.200]   have to your chrome cars around the house and you can then watch your home movie sort of stuff you
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:39.160]   bought from apples or other videos you have and and watch those on the on the chrome cars and that
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:43.880]   that was um i've been using that a lot recently i was really impressed with how smooth they made
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:49.160]   the experience and how much nicer it was than the sort of the google play experience to some
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:54.680]   extent you have to have a premium account i think though right yeah you have to pay five bucks for
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:59.080]   the app i think of any words so the the server you run yourself and you pay five bucks for the app
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:03.560]   um and i i found it worth it because it was it made it much that process was always like i've
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:07.880]   got to go and copy this somewhere and i've got to open the browser on the on the mac and share it
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:12.280]   to the thing and this means you just run the plex server on the mac that has the hard drive attached
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:17.000]   and then you can use your phones to send it to your chrome cars so that was my actual actually
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:23.160]   useful video sharing tip and this is a tip from our chat room traveled to the past of the web by
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:30.840]   right clicking pages and links is called memento it's a chrome oh let's go plug in you'll set the date
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:39.080]   me for time travel and then right click on a web page and say get near and you'll see what the
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:44.680]   page looked like from around that selected date now it works well with wikipedia because it's been
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:49.880]   around for a long time but it would only work with a site that is has a continuous history i guess
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:56.120]   it's must this must tie into archive.org though yeah it must be not at all yeah it does in fact i
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:01.640]   see the way back machine i found a very early version of my first company site which was nj.com
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:10.600]   in '96 nj.com and so are you going to post that on twitter or whatever your social network was
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.400]   my earliest my earliest was called rain or shine it was it was their first version of nj.com what year
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:22.760]   was that it was probably 95 that was really good all right i gotta since we're doing silly tools
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:29.880]   i can get this tool from jeff what was the site because i can't get your your message to me
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:35.000]   oh shoot jeff what was that silly site
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:48.600]   crumble see our um bl e crumbles see our um bl es dot co.com i think you're right and so somebody has
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:56.760]   done that thing where you take videos and you take words out of it except that they've put these
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:03.720]   all online so you can build your own crumble you can either use the standard dictionary or it can
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:11.640]   be all Homer Simpson all the time so let's just try good night everybody
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:20.360]   sweet dreams it'll go in red if it doesn't have that word let's see if i can make a video out of
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:25.640]   this oops sweet nightmares didn't have dreams
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:41.160]   nightmare sweet candy candy sweet donuts we know there'll be donuts all right now we'll play the
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:46.040]   video turn up the sound here we go good night everybody sweet donuts
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:58:00.040]   imagine the fun you'll have with crumbles dot co thank you everybody we have fun and i hope you
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:06.920]   had fun and we also talked some deep stuff and Kevin marks today added the deepness we appreciate
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:12.360]   it Kevin uh well we should mention your blog but i guess if you go to kevin marks dot com that'll
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:17.240]   drive everybody to the places you wish them to guess i want to pronounce it yeah because i don't
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:23.320]   want to say it pay us a big any yes because it's fattic and i everything i post on my blog now i
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:30.600]   post on there too good yeah i noticed you posted it everywhere well that was um that's part of
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:35.880]   this is the indie web thing of publishing your own site first and share elsewhere so i i said
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:39.720]   okay i'll post it on my site and then it's like oh but i should post it on my known site and i
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:46.040]   should post it on my blog that's the poem i could put it on medium and you know and it's a lot of
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:49.480]   that is still fairly manual we need to make that a bit more automated we got some automated things
[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:54.840]   and you know we talked about before and i was running at leo vilda and i like it a lot i use
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:59.720]   it to post some of my uh london pictures and so i saw the saw those those are great yeah but i still
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:05.080]   do feel like it's become i mean it's actually a nice little blog platform is what it is yeah um but i
[01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:09.800]   i don't know if it's become the the the two-way street that i was hoping it would be well that's
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:14.920]   the challenge is is that we're working on in the indie web thing is and this is what we're talking
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:20.600]   about uh the web mentions and vouching and things like that we need to be able to read things as
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:24.200]   well as write them right so we need we need to read a half of this and now that you know that's
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:29.320]   part of what um twitter brawl and facebook newsfeed brawl was that you read in the same place you're
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:33.480]   posting right um and we need to bring that to the web too and i know the known guys are working on
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:39.880]   that but the challenge and in in if you if you if you use known as a group blog that works now
[01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:43.800]   because you can always see the people who are in the same vlogs post as you and that's one of the
[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:48.600]   use cases they've been finding a lot of traction from from groups of students and people who write
[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:53.240]   together um but the challenge is can you i don't subscribe to people elsewhere as well and how do
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:59.800]   we make that work and and the sort of getting the mechanism for that right um is to some extent is
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:04.200]   it's reinventing the the blogging subscriptions and readers and things that we had before
[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:08.280]   we want to try and do that in a way that that sort of plugs in with the the social web too so
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:13.480]   that's that's that's an ongoing thing that's going on um and i know that the known guys are at
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:19.160]   intonatially workshop this week um and talking protocols and specs there and the other thing
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:24.920]   that's going on this week is the derri three c um meet up in center clara where there's lots of
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:30.200]   network going on there that's where i was yesterday so there's there's there's lots of you know
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:37.400]   trying to keep the web um the web is is a lot of what this is about and that's um i'm getting
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:43.560]   encouraged by that and so there's somebody wrote an article that was um going back to the web that
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:52.840]   was or something i don't know what it was called um the great web 1.0 revival that was it oh yeah i
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:58.680]   love that um which was which was talking about these sort of indie web type things and tilde club
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:06.680]   um and you know an elo which has a graphic design style like that website of mine from 1996 um
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:11.800]   and it's it is very much this sense of oh right it's going back to that point where we were
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:16.840]   remember that the the group was still just the nice people and and because we hadn't hit the
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:21.240]   explosion of the trolls yet here's tilde club this is such a great story the guys spun up
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:28.920]   a uh amazon web server instance just one machine and uh sent out notes saying uh it's a terminal
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:33.560]   it here if you want it set up a web page put a web page on here and of course it can only handle
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:41.160]   a few hundred page and it is literally it's paul forward who's um f train dot com um and he
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:47.080]   also gave a great speech at um xoxo which i think was posted this week but what he he literally
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:54.680]   said okay why don't i make um a web a web server like we had back back then 20 years ago and so
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:02:00.360]   we did and the thing is now it's like it's it's cost him like you know ten dollars a week to to
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:04.520]   have this up and running at amazon because it's this this small thing but he can host hundreds of
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:09.560]   people on it he said he knew he'd made it when somebody found him went to his house and slipped
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:16.120]   24 dollars under his door to thank him for creating tilde club and of course one of the ethic the
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:21.560]   kind of the ethos of it is no images right it's all asky no no no it's it's a web server so there are
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.400]   well there are actually there are quite a few images come to think of it it's been depends
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:30.680]   but the point is that is that you're using a a web server of that era pretty much yeah so you're
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:35.560]   trying to fit that it's running a patchy yeah yeah so when it's images it's like this
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:45.160]   right don't ask for an invite he's closed yeah it's full but but they says one of the things he
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:50.200]   says they're doing is they're putting together a how do how do you set up your own one yeah oh by
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.920]   the way one of the nice things about tilde club they've got a web ring
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:03:01.560]   i don't remember those if you remember web rings then you need to be back to the web one point
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:06.600]   assets yeah some of this nostalgia probably is misplaced you might admit that cabin right
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:13.080]   um i don't know i think it's the part of the point is it's trying to rediscover
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:17.800]   it was the thing i realized that made me write that post about twitter was that
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:24.360]   the conceptual environment is different on twitter now that it was you know even five years ago when
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:29.080]   i wrote the first um twitter theory post um because the stuff has changed and people's
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:36.760]   experimental model of it has changed with that um and you know i think going back
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:42.600]   yes somebody described the indy web group as the sort of creative anacronism for the web yeah
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:46.760]   um you're just re just reenacting medley the medieval web right it's a renaissance sphere for the web
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:51.800]   yeah but but part of the point is is that there were a set of things that we did then
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:56.280]   that had some assumptions around them and try to recapture those assumptions then we can
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:59.320]   examine them in the light of what's happened since and say there were good things at that
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:03.480]   there were good things that this how do we how do we make a you know a new web that brings the best
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:08.920]   of both and that that's you know indy web is not like um thou shalt thou shalt never use twitter
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:14.600]   it's how do we plug our own personal sites into twitter in such a way that um the website will
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:20.040]   still be around in ten years time even if twitter's come and gone by then and that's that's that
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:24.440]   it's sort of it's that long-term thinking but it's also saying we want to take advantage of the
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:29.080]   pieces the communication methods and things that are here now because obviously twitter is great i
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:33.320]   i'm not attacking twitter with this poster with any web stuff i think it's wonderful and i want
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:39.480]   it to stay great and part of it is is helping you know think about how to do that how to make it
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:45.800]   part of the web not something that fights the web kevin larks.com i agree find out more about the
