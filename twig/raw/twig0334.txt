[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580]   It's time for Twig this weekend. Google Gina Trapani is here. Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.880]   Lindy Johnson, we're going to talk about the end of the year, the start of a new year.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.040]   Big moves for Google. What were the biggest moves for Google in 2015?
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.580]   And Twitter's moved to 10,000 characters. What does it mean?
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.940]   What does it all mean? We'll find out next.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.940]   On Twig.

[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:49.120]   It's time for Twig this week in Google and anything else, you know, Facebook, Twitter, whatever.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.120]   We want to talk about it. That's basically the rule here.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.120]   Because we've got great people on the show. In fact, this is going to be really fun.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.120]   Lindy Johnson is here. She is a content engagement strategist, digital thinker.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.120]   It writes a monthly tech column for Ebony magazine at Ebony.com.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.120]   I should say hello, Lindy.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   It's weekly.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   It's weekly.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   Yes.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.120]   Well, you couldn't do it monthly in Ebony.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120]   No.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   Weekly in my mind.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   I'm on the website.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.120]   You're on the website, Ebony.com.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   Hey, Lindy. Nice to have you back.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.120]   Also with us, it's been nice to have you back.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   Gina Trapani in her monthly appearance.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120]   Hi.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.120]   She's on Twig monthly.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.120]   Used to be weekly.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   I am monthly.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.120]   Happy New Year.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   Happy New Year.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   Great to be here.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.120]   Great to be here.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.120]   We're getting a lot of echo.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120]   And I think that's coming probably from Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.120]   Do you have a speaker on there, Jeff, for maybe Lindy's?
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120]   He's in Miami.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.120]   What are you in Miami for?
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   The night foundation.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.120]   Oh, good night.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.120]   Tonight.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.120]   I run the tower night center, so I'm going to see them.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120]   Oh, nice.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.120]   Nice people.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120]   You come to them.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   You have to come to them once a year, hat and hand, and say, "Please continue to fund this."
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   Less than once a year, but that's why I'm here, yes.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   Let's be fair.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   Let's be honest.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   But the night foundation is a good foundation.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   A good foundation.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.120]   They're really good.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   The primary funder of journalism in America.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120]   Thank God somebody does.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.960]   Amen.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   And I was, we're not.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   Hello.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   Happy New Year, everyone.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   Hey, here we are.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.960]   Did we all look at the year in review?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   Did you think up to a year in my tweets a year in review?
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.960]   We did.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   We did.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   Yeah, I liked my tweets.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   I didn't feel so bad after the year you gave me.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   I'm not sure.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   I'm so glad.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   I'm so glad.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   So, Leo Laporte.thinkup.com/2015.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   Okay.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   And yeah, we did one a day.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   It was kind of like an advent calendar of insights throughout the month.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   December was a big month for us.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   And yeah, yours and Jeff's were really great.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.960]   Biggest posts of each month in 2015, January, March.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.960]   Apparently, they tweeted all in February.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   War April.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   May.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.960]   Oh, I got some broken photos there.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   Yikes.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.960]   Man, Facebook.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   It's not your fault, I'm sure.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   Yeah, it's Facebook.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   Yeah, it's the Facebook.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   It's the Facebook.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   Yeah, they're your biggest tweets.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   Actually, please hide them.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   Thank you.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   My best tweet was, of course, that picture of me getting my head shaved.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960]   Ah, yes.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   Can't miss that.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   That was also one of my...
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   New years.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960]   Ah, New years.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   We didn't do that this year and can't say I'm really unhappy about that.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   We took a vacation.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   Maybe it's Leo, maybe it's your hair that weighed too much.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   We were talking before the show began.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.640]   I got thrown off my Virgin America plane because the plane was overweight.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.760]   And then I put other people on.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.400]   I feel like Kevin Smith.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.360]   I didn't ask for one of those expandable seat belts or anything.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.640]   I was using a normal person seat belt.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.600]   Oh, anyway.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.440]   Thank you, Virgin America.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.400]   I still like Virgin America because it's purple.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.120]   And I think purple's a nice color.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   It's a nice experience.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   It's the Virgin America.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.120]   I like flying.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   Look at this.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.120]   This is a nice insight.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.640]   Leo the Port did not rehash 2015's top news on Facebook.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.200]   What does that mean?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.280]   So Facebook comes out with a year-end top stories of the year.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   And so we go through your status updates, your post.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.280]   See if I mentioned it.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   See if you mentioned it.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.280]   Doing very primitive matching.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   And you didn't.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.280]   I'm proud of myself.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.360]   This is a award worth winning.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   Now, on Twitter, it looks like you mentioned a couple of those.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.360]   Oopsies.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   Star Wars.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360]   Star Wars.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.640]   But that was, see, I was mentioning when they sold at the digital collection, not the movie.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.440]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.080]   That's earthquake.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.080]   Paris.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.080]   Paris.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   Well, yeah.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   Okay.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.240]   Hey, what do you guys think about 10,000 character tweets coming soon to a Twitter near
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   you?
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.240]   Weird, weird, weird.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.240]   It's not the Twitter.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.240]   It's medium.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   It changes everything.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   It changes everything.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.320]   Do you think it's Ev Williams envy?
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   On the part of Jack?
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.440]   No, I think it's content and article and advertising thus envy.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.440]   What does that mean?
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.640]   They want to...
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.720]   How would this help that?
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.520]   They want a place to get more engagement and time to put advertising.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.920]   We're not going to get 10,000 character advertisements.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   No, well, actually...
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   I'm not going to get 10,000 character advertisements.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   Well, actually...
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   More time.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.920]   More time.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   More time.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   Right.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.000]   If the art, if it carries, if it's like AMP and instant articles and the publisher's content
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   is just...
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.160]   The way it works for me is...
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.040]   If I click on a link and it's right there because it's...
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   Oh.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.480]   Then I'm okay with it, but the AMP should do that without this.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.040]   If instead a tweet is replaced by this, they don't want you to link off.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.040]   In other words, there was another...
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.120]   God, it's Link dead.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   God.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.800]   Link should see instantaneous, but AMP itself would do that without the need for this change
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   in format.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.880]   So I don't get that, but I understand the need to say, "When I click on a link, baby,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880]   I want to...
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   There!"
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.680]   And I don't want to feel like I'm leaving Twitter.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   Just like Nuzzle.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.920]   When you use Nuzzle and you go to AMP content, you don't feel like you're leaving Nuzzle.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.480]   But Twitter has its own...
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.240]   Isn't Twitter part of AMP?
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.480]   Yes, it is.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.320]   That's why this puzzles me because AMP content should appear like that.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.800]   Now, if that's what this is, if it's just opening up an AMP page, I'm cool with it because
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.960]   the publishers ad is there and brand is there and everything is there.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.040]   And the experience for the user is better.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.760]   But I don't...
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   That's not what this is.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   So in fact...
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   We're still secular.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   We don't really know what it is.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   Yeah, we don't.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.160]   Willow Ramis, who's been doing really knocking it out of the parking lot, said they're not
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.920]   raising the character limit.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.880]   They're becoming a walled garden.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.960]   And his point being, which I think is a good point, similar to what you just said, is instead
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   of...
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.640]   People could always post long articles on Twitter.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.480]   You post a link.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.400]   But what it's encouraging you to do instead is not post a link, but in fact, put the article
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.360]   on Twitter.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.720]   And that becomes then part of Twitter's walled garden.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.280]   But if it's like Instagram articles, and if I get an ad there, and if I get some data,
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.120]   and if I get some other things, as a publisher, I wouldn't be opposed.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:31.760]   If I'm expected, however, to publish my stuff separately and to publish it on Twitter,
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.000]   and I can't put my ad up there, then yeah, that I'm unhappy.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.040]   We don't know yet.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.800]   So, according to Jack's tweet, the only really know is what Jack tweeted, right?
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   Right.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.360]   And he compared it to what people are already doing, which is posting pictures of text.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.480]   Yeah, see, that's what I really like.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.480]   Well, it's taken slate.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.320]   The idea that you're not clicking on a link, that the link just kind of gets sucked in.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.520]   There's whole articles there.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.440]   But to me, as a user, there's a big difference between me containing an entire tweet storm
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.200]   into one post and me linking to one of Lynn's articles, right?
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.280]   One is something that I've written, and one is something that someone else has written
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.160]   that just kind of got sucked in or is being displayed there.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:19.640]   I mean, as soon as you get into a place where the user can type 10,000 characters, you're
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   looking at an editor with formatting and placing photos.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   How's that going to do that?
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.640]   I don't know.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   I don't know.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.040]   You're looking at a full blown editor, like all a medium.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.240]   I don't know if they're going to do that.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.240]   That seems weird.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.240]   It seems strange.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   On Twitter.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.560]   That's what Jack, I mean, Jack seemed to indicate like, hey, instead of taking a screenshot
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.280]   of this text, you could have written this text right here on Twitter, which is different
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.320]   than I'm just going to, you know, instead of linking to this article, I'm just going
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320]   to pull it in right here.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:54.840]   I have to say that Jack's tweet, which I'm showing here, which is a page, which is a picture
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:05.120]   of text so that you can do a long tweet, strikes me totally as spin, not really to the point,
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.240]   but merely spinning it.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.520]   What if the text that people are already putting in here as pictures were actually text that
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.720]   could be searched, could be highlighted?
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   That's more utility, more power.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.720]   More platform.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.720]   More platform.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.720]   More well.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   More prodigy.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   More.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.080]   He says, and I love tweet storms.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.600]   Those won't go away.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.920]   I love the little autocorrect red doodle, Honda there.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.920]   That's a word.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   Sorry.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.200]   That's one problem with it, by the way, as screen capping text, you get the operating
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.520]   systems complaints about your spelling.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.720]   And the cursor.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   And the cursor.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   Well, we know he's using a Mac.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.160]   So Lynn, do you think this is not Twitter anymore?
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.040]   No, it becomes a publishing platform, right?
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:02.400]   And not just, because when Twitter started, the argument was always, is Twitter about
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.600]   what I'm doing now or is Twitter about sharing news, right?
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.920]   But this takes it in an even entirely different direction where it's more of medium, like
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.640]   Gina said, publishing platform.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.720]   I don't think it's just about getting instant articles.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:27.240]   I think it's about adding more context to content and having more SEO power and more
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.520]   of a work garden, doing more of a Facebook thing.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.000]   This is a big pivot.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.880]   This isn't, you know, Jack would have you believe, well, no, it looks the same.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.880]   You still have 140 characters.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.200]   Now there's a more button or a dot, dot, dot, something to indicate there's more text
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.360]   you can open up.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.880]   It's not, it's going to be the same, but better.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.280]   No, this strikes me really as quite a pivot for Twitter.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.280]   So Lynn, what would you tell your clients about how to exploit this?
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.280]   Ah, good question.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.200]   Well, that's a tricky one.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:04.520]   I mean, for brands, I mean, it could be, the thing is this, if people spend more time
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.680]   with, people are going to spend more time with less stuff, that's what definitely ends
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.680]   up happening.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.880]   When you look at Twitter feed, you go through things really quickly, right?
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.960]   So now you'll be spending more time with less stuff.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:28.240]   So that less stuff has to resonate in a better way and influence, this change, influence
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.360]   works on Twitter too.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.920]   So I think what I would recommend to brands is it's not even like, I don't know, it just
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   changes things so much.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.520]   You have to think of Twitter as something different, don't you?
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.680]   Yeah, it's like, I can't even think of what the strategy would be at this stage.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:50.200]   I have to really see it because is it like, when you see it, will you see 140 characters
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   and then if you want to see more, you click to see more.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.080]   You know how some sites now to see the rest of the article, you click to see the rest of
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.280]   the article.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.040]   Is it an instant article type of thing?
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.760]   Is it really, is it going to be like medium?
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:10.200]   And if it is going to be like medium, then brands do definitely have to start thinking
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.560]   about being more content publishers.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:21.040]   In my opinion, if, so there's just no question that Twitter is 140 characters, period, that's
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.040]   Twitter.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.480]   It's the defining character.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.160]   It is the defining character is a period.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.760]   So if you're going to be a brand, you're going to, I would say continue to use Twitter
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.320]   as you had.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:37.000]   I mean, I as a Twitter user, I don't want a 1500 word article from a brand.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.120]   I want a short tweet, a picture.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.400]   That's what Twitter is.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.840]   On the other hand, if you're a new, it depends on the brand, doesn't it?
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.000]   So I'm thinking craft cheese.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.640]   But if you're a news property, Jeff, if you're watching in post, how would you use this?
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.840]   Would you put an article there?
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.560]   I mean, I think, well, again, depends on the business deal, depends on what your ad and
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.200]   your data and your brand looks like.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   But people are going to come to our sites anymore and we have to go to them.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.360]   So this user like Facebook, use it like medium, like it's an article.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.600]   I think it's maybe instant articles, jealousy.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.800]   Now, if I'm Google and am looking at this, you're right, Twitter was a partner in AMP.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.520]   AMP does this with a plain old web page.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.720]   It doesn't create walled gardens.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   It keeps the open web.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.520]   How would, so if Twitter wanted to support AMP, how would they support AMP and still
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   accomplish this?
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.240]   With a link to an AMP page?
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.440]   To an AMP page, the AMP page just opens up.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   It won't open.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.440]   And you could do it modularly.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.760]   You could create an AMP module so it opened up in a Twitter client.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.760]   Oh, it could.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.520]   So it could Ajax in an Ajax-y fashion kind of swoop open and then you'd read it and then
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.520]   swoop close.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.920]   I would like that as an interface.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.160]   That would be nice.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   Maybe that's how it would be.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.160]   We don't know that that's not what we're going to do.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160]   We don't know.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.240]   But that's not a, and that's just a, but that's the reason that we know that's not AMP
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.600]   is because that's not just a, there's not a 10,000 character limit on web page.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   Oh, AMP could be any length.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.600]   Oh, AMP could be any length.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   Sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.440]   You know, we've got, we've got a confluence of a lot of things happening here, right?
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.680]   A lot of this is about people aren't linking off because they're just going through streams.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.560]   You know, the, the, the like and the link and all that is meaningless and some measure.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.080]   We have ad blocking causing huge issues.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.400]   We have just plain too much effing content.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.040]   There's just too much, too much repetition, too much of everything.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.000]   And so, you know, the confluence and mobile, mobile changes the experience.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   You don't want to link off.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.160]   It changes that.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.840]   So we're seeing some struggling with trying to figure out where the web goes.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.880]   And this is a, this is a fight of different visions, none, none very well gelled, I think.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.560]   If you look at what Twitter does with embedded tweets, it seems to me like what Twitter
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.160]   wants is for the news to happen on Twitter, right?
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.880]   Like they want the comments from the sources to happen on Twitter.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.240]   So, you know, sometimes 140 characters, it just isn't enough to say what you need to
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.080]   say or to have that clarity.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.280]   So, you know, I mean, one way that they could, they could support AMP is to amplify the tweet
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.280]   pages, right?
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.440]   Like the tweet pages themselves are the source.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.680]   And I think that's what, that's what Twitter wants.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.400]   And I imagine, you know, if I was a news publication, if I was still running life hacker, I could
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.720]   imagine, you know, having the headline and then in the more, the like three bullet points
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.560]   of the story, you know, the summary points, you know, and then the link off to the story,
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.680]   that could be one way to do it.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.880]   But I think there's going to be a lot of different ways to use that extra room.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.320]   I thought, I think we're also going to see a lot of clickbaity, upworthy, won't believe
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.480]   what happened next, try to get people to tap on the more.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.760]   It's such a, such a departure.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.840]   Maybe we shouldn't be, I shouldn't be quick to complain about it because maybe it'll be
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   great.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:47.240]   It really depends on what the experience is going to be like.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240]   We don't know yet.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.720]   We haven't seen it.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.280]   Mike Elkin just wrote a really good piece on how to use Twitter.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.200]   Let's see if I can find it.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.960]   In which he said you create three accounts, you continue your existing account, you create
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.560]   an account that is a news feed account, and then you create a third account that you pump
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.040]   news feeds into using if this than that.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:19.000]   Then you use TweetDeck and you're going to have a live updating news stream.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.280]   It was a clever idea.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.120]   I'll find the link.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.400]   But I think this might all be here.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.040]   This might all be up for grabs now.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.600]   This is a different...
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.440]   What is the problem that Mike is trying to solve?
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.440]   He wants to make a dashboard.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.920]   He says, basically, here's the premise.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.480]   I want to make a news dashboard where I just could keep, I could have this open on my screen
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.960]   and know what's going on in the world.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.200]   You can't just put your Twitter feed there because it's all misnashed up.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   You get everything.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.400]   You get sandwiches, you get news.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.920]   You make two new things.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.120]   It's better than I'm describing it.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.320]   The idea is to create this live stream dashboard of news information.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.680]   You use these accounts as a way to curate that.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.240]   I think it's a really good idea.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.600]   I think that that's based on the idea that Twitter is an unceder, like in a railroad
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:13.080]   station, a short enunciator of news stories, of headlines.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.920]   Then you click those and you go to the headline, I guess.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.520]   What about TweetDeck?
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.560]   All the Twitter clients are going to have to be redone, aren't they?
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.560]   They haven't updated TweetDeck in 100 years.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:30.520]   I don't even want to think about what we'll have to do with ThinkUp.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:37.400]   Do you feel like this is Jack Dorsey putting his stamp on Twitter?
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:44.200]   Maybe his response to the markets being unhappy about Twitter's growth.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.320]   That's why it feels like a pivot to me.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.720]   It feels like desperation.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:54.160]   It's like, "Let's just really shake things up."
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.160]   It does.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.200]   It seems like he wants to prove that he's willing to explore.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.920]   He wants to do something radical.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.920]   He wants to make some news.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.320]   It was interesting how the market responded to that announcement.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   What bums me out is that it just feels that this all the different social networks
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.840]   are converging upon this one experience.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.560]   Everything now is likes, not hearts and likes.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   Everything.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.920]   The news feed is now curated with while you're away or moments.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.280]   Twitter and Facebook and even to some degree and a little bit medium are all converging
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:28.480]   upon this one particular feed experience and expression of like or dislike or responses.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.480]   I don't love it.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.480]   I don't either.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.120]   I like a diversity of a lot of chips.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.880]   See, this is an opportunity to be the anti-Facebook.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.280]   Facebook carefully massages your feed in unpredictable ways.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.720]   You never know what you're going to get.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.920]   Twitter, everything's there.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   Let's use that.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.920]   That's why I love this.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.880]   Mike's article was in a baseline magazine, driving business success with technology, baseline
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.280]   mag.com.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.200]   It was exactly that.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   Here you go.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   Here's what Twitter really is.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.000]   It's the signaling system for what's going on.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.480]   Here's how you could use this in an effective way.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.600]   He did this a few days ago, 1229.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.800]   It might be absolutely to immediately but the new Twitter.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   It's a clever idea.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.040]   I wanted to set it up.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.800]   I was ready to do this.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   But more characters doesn't solve the organization problem.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.640]   I mean, it's still a problem of organization.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.640]   Right.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.440]   In fact, that's what Mike's solution is to create other feeds because your main feed
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.240]   is all this crap, is everything.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.640]   You create specialized feeds and then use them in TweetDeck which allows you to have
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.160]   multiple feeds live updating.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.640]   Is that something you could achieve with lists though, Leo?
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   Lists would do the same thing.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.200]   I use lists on Facebook for that reason.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Although, I think I'm one of the three people that does that.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   People don't like you.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   No.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.680]   On Facebook, it doesn't work well.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   I don't think.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.160]   On Twitter, I think it works a little better.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.760]   Well, I think people don't even use lists on Twitter.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.960]   I mean, I have several lists on Twitter and I don't use them.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.880]   When list came out, I made a ton of lists.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.000]   Yeah, rarely use them.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.160]   I made lists because on Facebook, because Robert Scobel said I should, and he actually
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160]   should I subscribe to something?
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160]   Now he doesn't use them anymore.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   No, I don't know what he does.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.800]   Who knows what Scobel does.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:37.640]   Tech people who aren't dummies is one of the lists that he made for me.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.760]   I'm sure you are all on it.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.320]   I was going to say, I hope I'm on that list.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.480]   It's actually some guy named Jason Kincaid, but he hasn't updated it since March.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.680]   So how good is that going to be?
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.680]   Lindy Johnson is here.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.120]   What is it?
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   Lynn Lava?
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   Lynn Lava.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.200]   Lynn Lava on the Twitter.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   You still use the Twitter.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.840]   You're not going to give a, oh, this is a good question.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.320]   Will you start writing longer articles on Twitter, Lynn?
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.720]   I don't write longer articles on LinkedIn.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   I don't know.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   That's right.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   You could do it on LinkedIn, couldn't you?
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   And I know people who do that.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   Right.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   I know a lot of people do it.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   I don't care for that too much.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   I don't want people to go.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.480]   Yeah, just because you can write a longer tweet doesn't mean that a lot of people will.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.480]   Right.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.680]   But you know, I would in a situation where I felt like the 140 just wasn't enough.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.960]   I mean, we've all been at a test spot where we have to edit, edit, edit.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.040]   But this is how you get creep.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.720]   And one of the things that's great about Twitter is that you have to edit and really
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.960]   make a succinct tweet.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.200]   But it's also a problem, isn't it?
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.800]   Because sometimes what happens with Twitter is, I think your mic is hot, Jason.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.000]   What sometimes happens with Twitter is that you look like you had a stroke because you're
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.400]   so succinct that you have to spend hours, I have to spend time going, okay, now what
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   is he saying?
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.680]   He's like reading a license plate on a car.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:03.640]   PRT, bright.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   It's not fun.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.200]   So but here's what it's creep because what will happen is you'll start writing everyone's
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.600]   while longer post and then you'll write longer and longer post.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.840]   You stop doing that thing.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.680]   Let's hear if we can make it more succinct.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.680]   I don't know.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:27.200]   Twitter, do you, do we all agree Twitter needs to do something?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.800]   I don't think so.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   Maybe about harassment.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.640]   Let's work on that Twitter.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:47.280]   Um, and again, organization, I mean, I don't mind the, the deluge of like everything at one
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   time.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:53.800]   Um, and yeah, you can use like some of the new, new features, the moments, right?
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.560]   And, and being able to dig into hashtags a little easier now.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:04.280]   Um, but sometimes I do wish I had, even the way the threats work, I still wish there was
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.160]   some more clarity to those.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.400]   I don't know.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   Well, as Patrick and our, our, our, one of my great staff members in the chat room is
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.160]   saying, we need an edit button on Twitter.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.960]   We, and they gave us moments.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.800]   We asked again for an edit tweet button.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:27.560]   I think it was 10,000 word posts that maybe you can't even edit.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   Imagine trying to proofread a 10,000 word, 10,000 character tweet before you press send
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.640]   and guaranteed you're going to have a problem in there.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.040]   I can't do 140 character without an error.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.840]   I sent out a tweet today that got retweeted and I wanted to edit it so badly.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.240]   But yeah, too late.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.680]   And you can't really delete it because by then it's too late because it's already gone out
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.920]   and they've been retweeted.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.400]   It's been retweeted.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   You're stuck.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.400]   I have learned to, to, uh, Twitter is one of those things where you really have to pause
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.720]   before you press the send button.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   Definitely.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   Many, big, big following.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.360]   Oh, I would have saved myself so much hassle.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.240]   So many times if I, because what happens with Twitter and we've talked about this before,
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.800]   is you tweet in anger.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.080]   And repented tweet and haste, repent at your leisure.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.800]   These are the problems of entrenched power users with followers.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.320]   What Twitter's, Twitter's perceived pro, like what they think their problem is that they're,
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320]   it was onboarding people, right?
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.920]   They want people to come in.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.880]   So for them moments was like, we're going to contextualize all the stuff that's happening
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.680]   on Twitter to make it easier to understand for people who are just coming in because
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.160]   what people first sign up for Twitter, like if you don't know what Twitter is, you're
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.160]   not comfortable with it.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   It's weird.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.160]   It's a weird experience.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.760]   I mean, even, even as a power user, there are times they're just like, I have no idea
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.520]   what this person is talking about.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.520]   Like was it a joke?
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.520]   Was it sarcastic?
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.960]   You really have to follow people for a while to get a sense of like what their styles and
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.960]   what they mean.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.920]   And I think that's really off putting to new users.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.660]   And that's Twitter's problem is bringing in new users.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.120]   So they don't care about our problems, right?
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.160]   They're trying to solve the problem of equity.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.080]   Boy, you have just come upon a huge insight.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.280]   No, seriously.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.080]   The companies are often asking the wrong questions or solving the wrong problems.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:23.320]   Instead of solving the problems of their users, in this case, they're solving a different,
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.600]   they're solving for a different X.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.440]   They're solving for the potential problems of potential new users.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.280]   Non-users that are coming in.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.720]   And that's probably mostly because the stock market is pressuring them to have big growth
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.720]   numbers.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   Growth.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   All about growth.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.920]   Solving for why, from our point of view as its users, should be solving for X.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   Well, right.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.200]   Well, we're experiencing X.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.360]   But they have us already, Leo.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.360]   They have us.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   We're engaged.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   We're there.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   We're not leaving, right?
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.800]   So maybe that is the right question.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:02.720]   There feels like there's a business school case study here of a, what questions, what
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.640]   problems should a company be trying to solve?
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.840]   Should they be trying to make a better experience for their existing users?
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.760]   Well, can they just ignore that?
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.000]   I mean, Amazon would be out of business if that's what they did.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.200]   I mean, well, yes.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.760]   You got to be doing both in parallel.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.960]   You got to be doing both.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.760]   It's just that when you introduce new features for potential new users, the existing users
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   are going to be like, what is this crap?
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   Which is what we're saying.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   Right.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.560]   And developers are going to be saying, what is this crap?
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.720]   Yeah, developers.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   I'm already like that.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.680]   I was kind of reach out to developers a little bit, even implying that maybe they would support
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.840]   third party clients again.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.080]   I mean, they're definitely right.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.520]   At Sherp, they did a lot of outreach.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.360]   Jack said in his screenshot tweet that he would, they would let developers know well
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:56.080]   in advance, you know, to stem any sort of developer freak out at the, you know, the idea
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.360]   that everybody's got to make their database fields, you know?
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.360]   Right.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.080]   Well, what this, you're a Twitter developer.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:11.240]   I think that's what think of is, would you expect and want an API modifications to support
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.760]   this new feature?
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.200]   I mean, I would expect that they made the announcements, you know, that they gave me
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.280]   a heads up about what the API changes were going to be.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.560]   So that the day that they turned this on for everyone, my app doesn't break, right?
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.560]   Right.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.960]   And Jack hinted that he would do that.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.560]   So yeah, I would definitely, I would definitely expect that.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.480]   The API is defined as like when you, when you request a tweet, you're going to get up
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.720]   to this many characters.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   Right.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   It's complete change.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   And you're right.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.720]   You're right.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.640]   You're app assuming that like according to the rules of the API.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.080]   So overflow buffers everywhere.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   Right.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.760]   They're not going to change the API without giving, giving people a heads up or versioning.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.240]   Usually they version them out.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.240]   Right.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:57.440]   It's an interesting, and they're implying or the, the stories are implying that this
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.840]   is going to happen in the like in the next couple of months, like Mark.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.600]   It's a few months, although Jack seems to, Jack said that they're exploring internally.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.800]   And they'll let people know.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   Right.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.440]   Like, so this could be just like a labs thing that never sees a light a day.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.360]   But read the recode report was pretty.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.680]   Kurt got it.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.280]   Pretty detailed.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.520]   I think that maybe what's going on right now is Twitter is listening carefully, I
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.000]   hope to people and their reactions.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.080]   I mean, the thing is though, the whole thing with how startups work and this focus on acquisition
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.880]   versus retention, I mean, it costs so much more.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.960]   Twitter is no longer a startup, Lynn.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   Is it?
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:49.920]   Can we treat this as a startup as still after eight, 10 years, whatever it is?
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.920]   10 years now.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.920]   10 years this year.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.920]   Hey, Jeff's back.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.880]   Leo, what is Jeff saying?
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   He's rebooting his pixel.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.320]   Oh, he's going to go to Skype now.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.320]   Oh, I'm not.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.320]   No, I'm not.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.320]   I'm not a little aces book.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   Oh my god.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   It's working.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.760]   This is my bricked book.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.200]   Can't turn it off.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.560]   Can't do anything.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560]   Pixel C.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.560]   Oh, no.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.760]   Jason said he was hearing something.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.000]   So I pulled out the audio plug.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   I don't know if you can see it.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.600]   And all it says is, all it says is waiting for fast boot command.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   I can't turn it off.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   I can't do anything.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   Okay.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   Anybody watching?
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.520]   I'm going to have to be a hold down the power and I hold down the volume up.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:35.960]   We need to reset Jeff's pixel C. We need a hard reset.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.360]   Matt cuts is in the middle of his run right now.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.360]   And he's there.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.800]   He's calling you.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.160]   So sales and just what I needed now.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.600]   No, I don't want your car now.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:53.800]   You can remove data from your pixel C by reset and charge your pixel C. Plug it in.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   God.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   All right, Jeff.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.600]   Can't restart it.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.720]   So a hundred bucks down the trigger.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.280]   No, no, no, of course not.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.840]   You're the host of this week in Google.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.040]   You're the author of what would Google do and he experienced gifts.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.000]   You're on the road and you depended on your pixel C. And now you had to use some Acer
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.500]   crap.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.200]   Thank God you had that.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   Aces.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   Thank goodness I have it.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.640]   So the flip book, which I got before and I as a demo unit, I kind of sent it back because
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.200]   it was a little too slow.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.400]   I tried it again to the store and I thought, well, it's really light.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.400]   It's really kind of cool.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.200]   So I got one because they're cheap.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   That's what I want.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:37.880]   So I thought I'll carry the pixel C for Skype and I'll carry the flip book for Chrome.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.360]   And it's just not making sense.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.680]   There were some wonderful CES announcements about Chrome OS.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.920]   We'll talk about that a bit.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.920]   Well, we can't wait.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.480]   Oh, I think.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.800]   You know, I think, I think.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.160]   But first a word from Squarespace.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   You know Squarespace.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.160]   We all know Squarespace.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.160]   We all love Squarespace.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   There's my favorite part of it.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.200]   That's the cover page.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   And you know what?
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   That's a goo.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   I didn't even.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   This was interesting.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.200]   So this is their cover page feature.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.280]   It takes animated gifts.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.680]   You can use the arrow key, left arrow key and I'll go back to that Jeff and Gina.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:15.280]   I think that was an animated gift that was created by Google Photos of just, we had three
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.600]   photos taken of us at Google I/O a couple of years ago.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.240]   And I love having that there.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.800]   And I love it that I can use animated gifts on my cover page.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.280]   The cover page has links to my Facebook, my Twitter, my YouTube, my PGP key.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.920]   My blog is also at Squarespace.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.160]   My photo album is at Squarespace.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.360]   Even my calendar.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.360]   And that's just me.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.320]   If you're a musician and you have a band, you could put your sell your CDs or your DVDs
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.720]   or whatever it is you sell.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.280]   USB keys there, digital downloads.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:46.560]   Because yes, every Squarespace template has e-commerce built in.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.600]   You can, they have, they have templates just for bands that have their calendar and sales
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   and everything.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   It's so great.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.120]   And you can start with these incredibly well designed templates.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.760]   State of the art, engineering, state of the art design, customize.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.920]   It's very easy to do.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.480]   You do not have to be some massively skilled person.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.440]   Although if you're a real, you know, you like, if you like to tweak it, you can do that
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.720]   to their hundreds of settings.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.000]   And if you are a developer, you can do CSS, JavaScript, everything.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   So it's all there.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.560]   They've got a great developer platform.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.480]   They have an IDE and everything.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.720]   But the point is that anybody can create a great site and you all should have your own
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.720]   site.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   Everybody needs to have their own site.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.280]   Whether you're an individual or a business or a band, you got a newborn, Edda should
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.600]   have her own site.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.200]   You need to have a web page because that's your place on the web that you control.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   Nobody else.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.760]   That's your place on the web.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.240]   Squarespace pricing is easy.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.600]   It's simple, very affordable, especially when you compare it to how much it costs to, like
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.200]   I did spend a lot of money to create a website.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.800]   Plus you get a free custom domain name with an annual purchase.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   Mobile is automatic.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.520]   It's a separate mobile site and a separate desktop site because all their sites are responsive.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.640]   They work great on any size screen.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.640]   Squarespace.com.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.640]   You could try it.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.840]   No credit card needed.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.400]   Squarespace.com.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.160]   Two weeks free and you can even import content from your old site so you can see what it would
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   look like.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:14.600]   If you decide to buy all I ask, use our offer code TWIG, TWIG, and you'll get 10% off and
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.960]   show your support for this week in Google.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.120]   Squarespace.com is the offer code TWIG.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.120]   I love that cover page.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.520]   Lindy Johnson is here.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.480]   She's a digital strategist, weekly columnist for ebony.com.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.880]   Gina Trappani making her regular visit.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.880]   We love her.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880]   We miss her.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   So nice to have you.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.120]   Jeff Jarvis, he's in Miami on assignment.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.440]   I don't know when they say that.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.560]   Jeff Jarvis is on assignment.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   In my trench coat.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   He's actually puking his guess out.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   Can I just want to switch back?
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.560]   I started.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   I just told it down for a very long time.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.560]   Yeah, that's been my experience too.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.560]   You have to hold it longer than you think.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.560]   Now let's stay on this and then if this fails again.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.560]   Look at my ship.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.560]   All right.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.560]   Sorry about all that folks.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.560]   I really apologize.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.560]   Did you ever say everything you had to say about Twitter because we can move on?
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.560]   Yes.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.560]   Yes.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.560]   Yes.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.560]   I only have 140 characters to say.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.560]   That's it.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   You said it all.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.560]   We just spent 10,000 characters talking about friggin' Twitter.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.560]   See, it's too much.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:17.560]   You know what?
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   Yes, it is too much.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.560]   Twitter is starting to look like Twitter.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.560]   Bloated, big, fat, heavy.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   We're going to throw Twitter off the plane.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:36.560]   I was kind of, you know, the boat that we were on, Royal Caribbean, has very high speed
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:43.560]   internet.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.560]   How do they do that?
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.560]   They're using this '03B' technology that is a new satellite.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.560]   It can be used for maritime, '03Bnetworks.com.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   And I gathered that the satellite is aiming at the ship.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:05.560]   Like it's a dedicated satellite service.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.560]   I don't know.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.560]   I measured 24 megabits down and 5, 10 megabits up.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.560]   Of course, it was the middle of the night.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.560]   Oh, geez.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.560]   Wow.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.560]   It was amazing.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   But the point being I had plenty of bandwidth.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.560]   It was $15 a day, unlimited.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.560]   And so I bought it for my phone and my laptop.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560]   And you know what?
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   I ended up almost the entire time on Facebook.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.560]   I was shocked.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   Facebook has won, in my opinion.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   Yeah, it has.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   I'm not wrong.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   I agree.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   No, I agree.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.560]   Talk me out of it.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.560]   We didn't kill Facebook, but no, I agree.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.560]   And in Messenger, too.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   Because all my messages were by Messenger.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   Because it turned out it was predictable.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.560]   Because I was at sea, I didn't know if I was at SMS.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.560]   I wasn't going to use Apple's Messages program, which is really unpredictable.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.560]   I had been using Telegram and WhatsApp.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.560]   But Messenger, Facebook, Messenger, everybody I know has Facebook.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   It's just easy.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   The only thing I found it did a lot of butt dialing.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.560]   It was a little too easy.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.560]   If you leave Messenger open, it's very easy to accidentally call somebody.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.560]   The bubbles are irritating.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   Chat heads.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.560]   Well, you can turn that.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.560]   That's because you're Android users.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560]   You don't get it on a knife.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   You can turn that off.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.560]   I should turn that off.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.560]   Yeah, you can turn that off.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.560]   And actually, it was weird, because my daughter's on an iPhone.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560]   I was on an iPhone.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.560]   Actually, this was earlier.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.560]   I was on an Android phone.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   And her chat head was had snow in it.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.560]   It was snowing, which I thought was kind of cool.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.560]   And I said, "Your chat head is snowing."
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.560]   She had no idea what I was talking about.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.560]   What are you talking about?
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   I don't understand.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.560]   Was it snowing where she was?
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   No, no, no.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.560]   Facebook, just you know how they do the Christmas-y thing.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   Oh, it was just a Christmas-y thing.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.560]   It was a Christmas-y, like snow globe.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.560]   It made her chat bubble a snow globe.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.560]   Your chat head is snowing.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.560]   What?
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.560]   That's exactly your reaction was what?
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.560]   Dad, are you stoned?
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.560]   Like, yeah.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.560]   What?
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.560]   What?
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.560]   I what?
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:11.560]   And then imagine trying to describe on Messenger a chat head.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.560]   Somebody's never seen one.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.560]   Right.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.560]   It's like, okay, now this doesn't happen on your phone, but on my phone.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:22.560]   Your face is basically suspended about every other thing that I have going on.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.560]   Again, Dad, are you stoned?
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.560]   Not creepy at all, by the way.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.560]   No.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.560]   I actually like it.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:35.560]   I feel like I have -- I'm a must embarrassed admit it, but I think Facebook has kind of won
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.560]   me over.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.560]   Oh.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.560]   I know.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.560]   I don't want to -- I don't want to.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.560]   One of the things I want to do this year is just stay in better touch with friends of mine.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.560]   And it's true.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.060]   I sort of gave in -- I had to add a Facebook app installed at all, but I installed Messenger
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.660]   because there are just certain friends in my life that like they're just -- they're there.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.740]   They're on Facebook and they message me and that I don't get it.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:01.260]   It goes into my other inbox and I don't see it and I'm like a bad friend.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.060]   So I finally even was like, I'm going to be a better friend and I'm going to, you know,
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.060]   communicate with my friends about their life events, their marriages and their kids and
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.060]   whatever on Facebook, but it was just -- it bummed me out that that was happening on Facebook.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:17.260]   But you called your Twitter friends?
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.260]   I did.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.260]   Well, yeah.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.580]   That was the beginning of 2015.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.180]   I just unfollowed everyone because I realized I was following a thousand people.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.180]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.180]   Well, that's a really good idea.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.100]   I was following a thousand people and then all this terrible stuff was happening just
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.460]   in the world, you know, shootings and police brutality and all this stuff.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.980]   And I realized that every time I went to my timeline, I was just, you know, tore up.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:43.380]   You know, it would be like somebody's chubby cat and like this horrible, you know, injustice,
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.380]   like next to one another.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.780]   And it was like emotionally like really jarring for me.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.700]   Like, and I found when I was looking in bed and I was trying to go to sleep, it was just
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.540]   bad for me.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.260]   I then followed everyone.
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.780]   And then over the course of the year, like slowly started to follow.
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.380]   I think I follow like 20 or 30 people now.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.380]   What?
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.380]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.380]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.380]   I'm following 2,422 people.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.380]   And it's right.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.980]   It's just a creat head over the last eight years.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.980]   I don't use that.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.980]   I use a list.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.980]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.380]   See, I just want to -- the list I made is much better.
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.420]   The list is just too far in the UI.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.420]   Like it just takes --
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.420]   Yeah, where are they?
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.420]   Where are they?
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.420]   They've moved them.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.420]   They've moved them.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:27.900]   But if you're using something like TweetDeck or HootSuite or something, you can break those
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:28.900]   lists out.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:29.900]   Exactly.
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.260]   Yeah, make that and say like this should be the view, the default view when I log in.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.260]   This is the other thing.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.260]   I just installed my Twitter app.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.260]   So I forced myself to use the web version of Twitter on --
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.260]   Yes.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.260]   That's what I've been doing.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.260]   So I wasn't getting notifications.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.940]   I was like, you know, hanging out with my family and my kid.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.380]   And I would get like a Tweet notification and I would get riled up about something, you
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.380]   know.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.380]   And I was just like, no, no.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.380]   I don't want push notifications.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.620]   So yeah, I kind of went minimalist and it was good.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.980]   It was good for me.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:59.300]   The web-based mobile version of Twitter is really like the worst experience.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.220]   So it made me Tweet Last, which I think was a good thing.
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.980]   I mean, you know, and a bad thing, right?
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.980]   Like there's probably stuff that I didn't share that I could have and should have.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.700]   And then there's probably stuff that I, you know, maybe was ill-advised and I didn't
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   say.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.220]   So, you know, both ways.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.220]   So, you know.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.140]   See, this is again going back to Mike's idea that if you had separate, you should have
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:26.100]   maybe a personal Twitter feed, a news Twitter feed, maybe lists would do that, but they're
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.900]   kind of opaque hard to reach.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.500]   You could have separate accounts.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.900]   I could, I could just, you know, I was using the default Twitter client.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.180]   I could find a client that let me, that said, you know, hey, just default to this personal
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.500]   chill low-volume lists of people.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.980]   And then what I'm feeling like I want to dive into the news and see what people are
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.740]   saying about things, you know, switch to the other list.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.780]   I could have, but I just was like, I'm going to detox for a while.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:49.780]   And then I just kind of say-
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.780]   How about Facebook?
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.780]   Do you find it toxic?
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:55.660]   Well, you know, Facebook I really wasn't looking at at all.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.660]   And then until I realized that like stuff was happening in my, you know, sort of friends
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.180]   and family's lives that I was missing.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:04.620]   So I, I also, I'm kind of like, you know, and I was piping on my tweets to Facebook, but
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.380]   that was kind of bad.
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.620]   And so I'm trying to figure out, you know, how to use these different things.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.700]   Don't really wish we had another choice.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:18.700]   It's really shaken out to just a couple of social networks.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.700]   I really like Instagram.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.780]   It's just a whole time Instagram.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:22.780]   There are other choices.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.540]   If you're younger, there are definitely other choices.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.540]   What are the kids using?
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   Snapchat.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.500]   But Snapchat is a one to one thing, right?
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.180]   Or no, I guess some you could- You can do it to many.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.180]   Can you do it like Twitter?
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.220]   Where'd like you to, I guess you can't, you can have stories.
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.020]   You can have followers, right?
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.020]   Instagram too.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.260]   I spent a lot of time on Instagram.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.260]   Love Instagram.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.140]   Because a picture never really makes you sad.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:56.020]   A picture makes the thing, I have a very bad jealousy factor.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:02.500]   And so, and this is a total failing on my part, but when I see people like you having a good
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.180]   time, it makes me jealous.
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.700]   It's human nature.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.700]   It's human nature.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.700]   When I see other people's perfectly manicured homes, I'm like, ah.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.340]   And we now know that everybody's faking it on Instagram.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.340]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.020]   And everybody- Instagram's like a first date, right?
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.940]   It lies, yes.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.700]   It's a lying liar of lies.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.540]   It's a first date.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.380]   You comb your hair, you put on lipstick.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.940]   It's also a first date.
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.020]   There's a lot of good looking young people's selfies.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.020]   Let's say that.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.140]   But there are also like a lot of cute little kids and pets and-
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.460]   Yeah, no, I love it.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.540]   I have to just force myself to be happy for my friends.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:49.700]   This time of year is great because I see all my friends pretending to have fun at CES
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.900]   and I know they're lying.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.700]   I know they're actually in this role.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.060]   This is happy time of the year.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.540]   I'm so happy I'm not at CES right now, you guys.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.460]   I have never been at CES.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.780]   This probably makes me a terrible tech reporter or-
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.980]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.620]   And thank you to everyone who is on the ground at CES doing and reporting and figuring out
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.420]   what the good stuff is so that I don't have to.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.980]   Thank you so much.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.260]   It just seems like such a crazy circus.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.980]   I'm really happy that I'm not there.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.780]   And I'm sure that you have some great people from Twitter there.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.700]   We do.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.700]   We have quite a few.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.860]   We're doing a lot of coverage.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.180]   But note that I am not.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.700]   Yes.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.420]   So I'm happy.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.580]   One of the things, though, I would have been looking at is Chrome OS laptop.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.340]   So of course, a lot of Windows laptops.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.260]   Apple's note, not a presence at CES.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.340]   But there are a lot of Windows laptops.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:45.140]   But I think there's some really interesting new Chromebooks, including these Acer Chrome
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.140]   bases.
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.700]   It's an all-in-one.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:56.140]   And these are running big Intel processors, their core processors, with lots of RAM, some
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.100]   of them have eight gigs of RAM.
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.620]   This one has a 23.8-inch screen.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:01.620]   It looks like an iMac.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.620]   Wow.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:03.620]   That does look like an iMac.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:04.620]   And I'm really in-
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.620]   I'm exhausted.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.620]   I'm exhausted because I have to buy now.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.620]   I know.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.340]   Well, but it's cheaper than an iMac.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.340]   How much is that?
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.340]   I don't know.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.340]   I feel like--
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.380]   I'm sure it's better be a lot cheaper than an iMac.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.780]   It's got to be, right?
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.500]   It had tiltable display from negative 5 to 30 degrees.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.540]   Oh, specs and pricing will vary by region.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.140]   But you know, it's a Chrome OS.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.140]   I mean, $179 for their 11-inch Chromebook.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.660]   So you know it can't be that expensive.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.940]   But I feel like that I'm really pleased to see Chrome OS flourish.
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.540]   I am to Lord knows.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:41.860]   And finally get some variation from basically netbooks with Chrome OS on them.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.460]   Because that wasn't a good solution.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   No.
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.860]   But I still don't have a perfect machine.
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:51.860]   My perfect machine is almost as much power as my Pixel.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.540]   Not as much because they'd be very expensive.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.540]   I don't have to have quite the killer screen.
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.020]   I do like touchscreen.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.980]   I rent LTE.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.220]   I want a really nice keyboard.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:05.180]   I think this Acer Chrome base, now it's not portable.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.780]   Do you want it to be portable?
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.780]   Well, yeah.
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:13.100]   Because what I do now is I have an old Pixel and a new Pixel.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:17.260]   So what I finally do is I put the old Pixel in my office at work and my new Pixel is at
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.260]   home.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:24.140]   And then I was going to carry back and forth the Pixel C. But now I might carry the Asus
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.620]   back and forth because I really need Chrome.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:29.580]   I need a keyboard and Chrome to do what I do for work.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.420]   So this is an update at Refresh of their last year's model, which was only about 400
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.420]   years.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:39.980]   So I don't think it's 24-inch screen.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.980]   Touch.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:41.980]   Multitouch.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:42.980]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:43.980]   I have this.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:44.980]   This is a classroom.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.980]   That makes you a kiosk.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:50.540]   Eight gigs of RAM, which on Chrome OS, my experience has been--
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:51.540]   It's fine.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.540]   Makes a big difference.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.540]   It's fine.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.540]   But you need more RAM.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.220]   1920 by 1080.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.820]   I want to see more of this stuff.
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.660]   I think this is great.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.660]   So that's what I--
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.660]   Yeah, there were a lot of--
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:07.660]   There were a lot of--
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.140]   I don't know how Lenovo has a new one.
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.980]   All the-- it was the usual suspects, right?
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:14.980]   The company's--
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.460]   Samsung has a Chromebook 3.
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.820]   We liked this Chromebook 2 from Samsung.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.820]   11.6-inch display.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.300]   Yeah, not so.
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.820]   It's a Celeron 2 to 4 gigs of RAM.
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.620]   See, I want to see these medium-powered--
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.460]   I don't want to see the low end.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.460]   Yes.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.460]   I agree.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.460]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.460]   Thinkpad 13.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.460]   I'm a little powered one right now.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.460]   That's the problem.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.460]   How about this one?
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.460]   Let's you choose between Windows 10 or Chrome OS?
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.460]   Ooh.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.460]   And it kind of looks like a standard Lenovo.
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:52.460]   I mean, it's got the-- you know, so Thinkpad.
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.460]   I think that's kind of intriguing.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.460]   13-inch Thinkpad.
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.460]   An underpowered Chrome OS machine.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.460]   Well, yeah, who wants it?
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.460]   Yeah, who wants it?
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:05.460]   Why me?
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.460]   These come with an i5 up to 16 gigs of RAM.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.460]   That's because, of course, with Windows, you'd need that.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:15.460]   But when you're running Chrome OS, you get all the benefit of that.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.460]   I guess it's two different versions.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.460]   It's not like you can do a boot or a can you.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.460]   Let me look.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.460]   I came within an inch of thinking, oh, hell, I have to buy an Oculus
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.460]   Rift.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.460]   And then I see it requires a Windows machine.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.460]   I guess you get numerous upsets on this.
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.460]   First of all, I immediately ordered one, $600.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.460]   Comes in May.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.460]   And then I found out I get a free one anyway, because I was a
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.460]   Kickstarter supporter way back then.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.460]   Right.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.460]   Oh, did you cancel the order?
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.460]   I'm going to try.
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.460]   Which is really great of them.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.460]   That's amazing that they're doing that.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:47.460]   That's cool.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.460]   Thank you.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.460]   Yeah, they didn't need to.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:51.460]   And I think this was kind of a response to all the people like me,
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.460]   Kickstarter people were pissed off when they sold to Facebook for
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.460]   billions of dollars.
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.460]   Hey, this is our company.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.460]   We put money, good money in there.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.460]   So this is kind of a thank you.
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.460]   It's only a few thousand people.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.460]   But so I'm excited about that.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.460]   But then yeah, you they you can download a tester to see if your
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.460]   Windows machine is fast enough.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.460]   None of my Windows machine is fast enough.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.460]   No, you?
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.460]   None of them.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.460]   Oh.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.460]   But they're mostly laptops.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.460]   So you need you need kind of a gaming desktop is what you need.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.460]   You need an NVIDIA GTX, I think, 790 or better.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.460]   You need a I5, but not any I5.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.460]   You need I think like what is it, the 4950 or better?
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.460]   You need it.
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.460]   You need it not a monster, but you need a fairly hefty machine.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.460]   So I'm going to have to go out and buy a PC.
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.460]   $1200 PC to go with my.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.460]   It was this three options.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.460]   It was like Google Glass.
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:39.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.460]   Yeah, basically it's going to cost what glass cost.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.460]   And it's going to make me throw up and I'll use it once.
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:50.460]   Well, you're doing it in service of the viewer.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.460]   No, I have to do it.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.460]   Exactly.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.460]   I have to do it.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.460]   Yes.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.460]   I want to do it.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.460]   Take them over the team.
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.460]   Yeah, take them over for the team.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:03.020]   Well, you saw that I didn't bring I did bring a good camera on my cruise and I did I took
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:07.720]   a lot of iPhone pictures, but ultimately most of my pictures were that Rico Theta S the
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.900]   360 degree camera.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.020]   I'm really excited about that.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:15.660]   Can you see using that just in general life?
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.060]   It's well, I think I did.
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   You did, yeah.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.060]   It's true.
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.060]   They did.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.060]   In general life.
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.620]   I'm using quite a bit and I posted on YouTube if you go to my Leo Leport YouTube channel
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:31.460]   you can see all the videos.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:34.500]   But this is it's still not very good.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.340]   Now I'm going to friend envy your life.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.060]   Yeah, will you please?
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.060]   I will.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.060]   Will you please just envy my life?
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.060]   Definitely.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.900]   The quality is not great.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:51.620]   What's great is though that you could put this on Facebook or Google people were I was
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.940]   loving the reactions in the comments people would say, wait a minute, I turned my phone
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:51:01.020]   and the picture turns because if you have an up to date phone with up to date Facebook,
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:05.380]   your picture will follow your phone's angle and you can look around.
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.540]   It's very easy to shoot these.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.700]   You don't have to pan or anything.
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:13.420]   You just hold this stick and you just take it pictures as you walk or whatever.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:18.860]   And I wish the quality were better.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.060]   The next one will get this guy bumps me over here.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.060]   I'll get it gets better.
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:27.380]   But this is the robot bar where the we're robotic arms.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.780]   The same arms that are stealing the jobs of American workers everywhere.
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:31.780]   Stila.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.220]   Stila bartender's job.
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:35.220]   Nice.
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.220]   Two bartenders.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.860]   How do I work like that?
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:45.460]   Although I'm thinking somebody's got to fill those bottles that are hanging from the ceiling.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.460]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.340]   So those arms are reaching out for those bottles and pouring drinks.
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.380]   So watch, we're going to order a drink.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.140]   This is, I loved this.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.140]   Looks like an iPad.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.580]   It's an Android device.
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.420]   It's running a dedicated app.
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.420]   We'll turn it here.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:59.420]   I'll jump ahead a little bit.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.500]   We'll turn it around and show you.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.700]   So you can or you tap it.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:07.340]   By the way, you're wearing an RF enabled bracelet called a wow band.
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.340]   Wow.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.340]   It's like, Jim.
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.380]   It's a wow band.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:17.660]   And you tap the wow band to the, which I did about a bunch of times.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:24.340]   And then you can enter in your drink and that will be a sent to the robot bartender.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.140]   So there's the drink that I, non-alcoholic, of course.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.100]   By the way, adding insult to injury is a $4 drink.
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.500]   And then you add an 18% tip for the robot.
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.500]   No.
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.500]   No.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.500]   What the hell?
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.180]   Listen, robot rights.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:41.180]   Robot rights.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:47.220]   So watch, the robot now has a cup in its hand and it's going to, it puts it down.
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.300]   This is going to be my cup.
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:53.060]   And then it contains, it has a container and it goes around and it fills it up.
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:57.820]   There's a soda in the back and it's going to get some juice from the, those hanging
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.740]   bottles or booze bottles.
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.020]   And the woman is showing me that my name is up here and what drink and what stage the
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:07.460]   robot is in with the drink is, is over there.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.460]   And who buses your drink?
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.460]   If you don't, it's them well.
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.660]   Who buses the tables, humans have the menial jobs, of course, because they aren't, they
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.460]   don't allow the robots to roam freely.
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.460]   That would be dangerous.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:17.460]   You gave me 18%?
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.460]   This is, this is regular Royal Caribbean cruise.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.460]   Leo, this is, this is like, this is top drawer stuff.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:30.580]   Well, the reason I went on this boat, because I had to go to New Jersey to be on this boat,
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.540]   which is crazy because I went to New Jersey to sail to the Caribbean.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.180]   But the reason I went on this boat is because this is a new, this is a brand new boat.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.540]   This is like, this is their state of the art technology.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.740]   Yeah, it's very exclusive.
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:44.220]   There are only 5,000 other people on this boat with me.
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:49.660]   But the robot bar, you know, it's not too crowded.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.940]   You know, it's not, it's not jammed with people.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:54.380]   I love it that you can look around.
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.380]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.380]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:00.620]   And then you tap your well band on the bar when the robot's done and the drink comes
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:01.620]   sliding out to you.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.620]   That way, nobody could steal your drink.
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.620]   Oh, is that clever?
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.500]   Oh, very nice.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.500]   Yeah, I enjoyed it.
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.060]   Oh, that's a good version.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.060]   Mary there.
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.060]   What was that?
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.060]   What was what?
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.060]   Virgin Mary?
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.580]   Yeah, I didn't, I was not an alcoholic.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.740]   It was a spritzer of some kind.
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.380]   Four dollar spritzer plus 18% tip.
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:24.620]   Why are you tipping robots?
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.340]   Is this a bad precedent?
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.340]   It is.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:33.660]   Is that this as a damn tip jars that are everywhere now?
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:34.660]   I don't mind tipping.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:37.260]   I tip very well because I used to work in food service.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.260]   I understand.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:42.700]   But a robot is not going to spend that tip wisely.
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.300]   I'm just saying.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.660]   I assume the tip would go to the bus people, but I don't know.
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:48.660]   Yeah, I will.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.580]   Actually, you, every, okay, so this is another fun, fun fact.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:52.580]   I don't really care.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:56.020]   I'll be in everything has an 18% gratuity attached to it.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.340]   And then they distribute it evenly to the staff.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.340]   That's nice.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.140]   So that that were for Xia.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.140]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.140]   Yeah, because you know what?
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:07.980]   There's a lot of people that you don't see that wouldn't normally get a tip like the
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:14.820]   guy in the bait, but the bottom of the ship shoveling coal is not going to get a tip.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:16.140]   So you got to give him it.
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:19.900]   You know, I think it's appropriate that they spread it out evenly.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:20.900]   Okay.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.420]   Oh, there's so many stories.
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.420]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.420]   I'm talking about my vacation.
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.420]   No, we love you.
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:30.420]   I want to hear about that.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.420]   Yeah, I have a vacation.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:35.420]   The 10 most important moves Google made in 2015, 9 to 5 Google.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:38.140]   It's an impressive list, you know.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.140]   Alphabet.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.140]   Alphabet.
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:43.780]   It isn't because no one knows if we said alphabet this weekend alphabet.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.780]   What?
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:45.780]   This weekend alphabet.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.280]   What?
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:52.420]   But alphabet was, you know, probably the biggest event taking Google and splitting it up into
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:56.300]   smaller companies under a umbrella called alphabet.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.300]   Sender Pichai.
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:00.100]   I think this is something I think is even more important.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:02.340]   Sender Pichai is the CEO of Google.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.260]   Yeah, that's huge.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.140]   It is absolutely huge.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:10.260]   And I don't think people really pay any attention to that.
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:11.260]   Android Pay.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.780]   This is the year Android Pay came out.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.220]   No, it's not such a big deal.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:17.260]   It's a me too product.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.420]   Google photos though.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.900]   We have to agree is huge.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:20.900]   Huge, huge.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:25.380]   But photos was around in Google Plus since like 2011, right?
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.380]   And no one used it.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.380]   They still have the Google advances.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:30.380]   You know, it's really--
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.100]   Google advances in search were amazing.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:37.460]   And where Google Photos really shines is ironically is on the iPhone.
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.620]   That yeah, I found that out recently.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:44.060]   I've been at Google Fotted and iPhone that I got to test recently.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.340]   And I mean, to me, a lot of the Google products work better on the iPhone.
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.340]   Oh yeah.
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.540]   Except for Google now.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.540]   It doesn't work really well.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:56.900]   Yeah, because it's not a peer with Siri.
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.980]   You have to run it in an app, which is too bad.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:56:59.980]   That's Apple though.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:00.980]   That's not Google.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:01.980]   Right.
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:02.980]   Right.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.100]   But other than that, I mean, photos is great.
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:09.340]   The organization, it's awesome.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.900]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.460]   I wish though that they have a search term like for photos you'd be embarrassed if anybody
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.460]   saw.
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:20.100]   So you could just get them all in place and delete them.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.780]   Or first date photos and put them all on Facebook.
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:24.780]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:28.540]   They could refine those search tools.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.980]   Android Marshmallow, new version of Android, which isn't-- I'd have to defer to you--
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:33.980]   Yeah, that's up.
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:34.980]   Well, and--
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:35.980]   And after--
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:36.980]   And after the first--
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:37.980]   Yeah, man.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:38.980]   After the first--
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:39.980]   Yeah, man.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:40.980]   Man.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]   Man.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:45.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.220]   It wasn't a huge leap.
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:48.220]   No.
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.220]   It wasn't.
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:50.220]   It was about--
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.900]   I wish to have what I had about my Nexus 7.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:52.900]   But--
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:53.900]   Dose is good.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:58:00.180]   Two nights in a row, I've left my Nexus 6P un-- you know, unattached to the power.
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.900]   And it's only lost like 5%, 10% overnight.
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:03.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:04.900]   That's great.
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:05.900]   That's huge.
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:06.900]   In flow permission?
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.820]   Do you think users, normal users, notice that?
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:14.700]   Instead of doing the permissions all at once when you download an app, you get it as kind
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.900]   of like the iPhone does as you're using the app.
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.860]   Yeah, I don't think that normal people care or notice.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.860]   Right.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:22.860]   It just-- it makes me feel better when I'm like, oh, this is what this is--
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.860]   Right.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:24.860]   --after trying to do now.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:25.860]   I understand.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:26.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.860]   I just think it's just better transparency.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.060]   It makes sense because it's in context.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.660]   So you see what the permission it applies to.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.660]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.460]   Project Fi, which I'm loving, I'm using Fi on this phone.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.700]   It's a good deal.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.700]   Traveling internationally works just like T-Mobile does.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:48.580]   You get the cheap calling, the free texting, the free data, slow data.
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.940]   And that data's fast by the way.
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:51.540]   It's 3G now, pretty much.
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.700]   At least it wasn't the Bahamas.
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.060]   So it was very usable.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:58.020]   It wasn't like this really slow edge stuff.
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:00.420]   And so I can't remember.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.140]   We did the data story on Fi.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:05.140]   Can you have a data only Fi account or you have to have a photo?
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.780]   That was something they announced.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.380]   In fact, it's a tricky to mention that.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.100]   That they have a SIM that is data only now.
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:16.300]   But you have to have a phone account to add the data to it.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.420]   Or can you have a data only Fi account?
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:23.940]   My sense is that it was for tablets and that you just could get a different SIM.
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.940]   Let me see.
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:29.180]   How to set up a Project Fi data only SIM with your tablet?
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:35.300]   This is an article from Android Central.
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.300]   You have to have a Fi account.
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.300]   You have to have a Fi account.
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.340]   So you're in for the $30 a month or whatever it is.
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:43.340]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:44.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:51.700]   You have to have an unlocked tablet compatible with a T-Mobile LTE.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:52.700]   You have to have it.
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.140]   Yes, you have to have your phone first.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.140]   You're right.
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.260]   You can't just get only a tablet at least right now.
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.580]   You have to have a phone.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.060]   But you put 10 bucks per gigabyte and fractionally--
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.220]   Oh, it's good.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.140]   It's great.
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.340]   I just had to check my karma to make sure I had enough to do the show.
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.340]   It's sippen.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:15.220]   Yeah, the karma I like.
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.220]   Same idea.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.220]   You pay as you go, although it's a little more expensive.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.220]   That's how I love that.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.700]   And you know, these things do a moment.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.220]   These fickle, fickle, fickle, fooling companies.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.660]   All right, let's get to it.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.820]   We've been holding off.
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:33.340]   I've been putting it off Jeff and Verizon.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.340]   Never a love story.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.340]   No.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.340]   Cyber continues.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.340]   Never.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.300]   And people who ask me, do they ever hook up your Nexus 7?
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.500]   No, they never did.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.860]   So I had my wife's iPad on it.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.580]   And I had my own Pixel still on it.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.740]   Stupidly I hadn't canceled.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.340]   I was using the LTE on that.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.140]   But I had two things on it.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.780]   And I was paying $50 a month for those two things.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.300]   30 buck data plus 10 bucks per line.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:03.020]   And suddenly, it was Christmas time.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.540]   So we weren't using it either.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.020]   There was some go home that were at home.
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.180]   And suddenly I get data warnings.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.060]   You're going over data.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.060]   You're going over data.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.060]   They're all your way over data.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.060]   What the hell?
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:19.660]   So go on and somebody had hacked the account and added or switched the two lines to two
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:26.420]   iPhone 6s, brought a gig of data, immediately used 2.6 gigs of data.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:32.380]   Sigh hour and a half on the phone dealing with five different people with Verizon.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.740]   Stupid sandwich.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.740]   Just amazing.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.980]   They have no good process for this.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:36.980]   It's their problem.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.980]   So they changed my password.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.860]   This is not going to happen again, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.020]   We're all fixed up.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.020]   All right.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.020]   There were one.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.020]   They didn't change the password.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.020]   They came back and did it again.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.020]   Number two, they didn't fix it up.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.220]   Third time, I tried to kill the Chromebook.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.660]   I can't kill that.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.660]   It's back again.
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.140]   I finally said enough.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.140]   I wanted a divorce.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.140]   I went to the store and I said, just kill everything.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:00.860]   I put my wife's iPad onto our AT&T account.
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.700]   I saved a net of $60 a month by doing this.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.940]   And I waved goodbye to Verizon.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.940]   Well, two points for this.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.580]   So at one point in this, I had to go on my online Verizon.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.260]   They can set up the account and I had to come up with a friggin password.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:19.580]   So the password I wanted was F spelled out Verizon.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:25.500]   And honest to God, I swear to truth said bad password too easy to guess.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.500]   Too obvious.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.500]   Too obvious.
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:33.700]   Too easy to guess that our customers would feel this way at the point in which they're
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.700]   setting up their password.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.940]   So they screw Verizon?
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:38.940]   Same answer.
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   Really?
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:45.300]   How hard was the pushback when you said I wanted to cancel anything?
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.300]   Everything.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.300]   Did they?
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.300]   How hard did they push back?
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.260]   Oh, they didn't cry or they didn't do it.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:54.260]   So then they got to cry because they don't have to push back.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.260]   They just ignore you.
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.060]   They're a very nice lady, right?
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:01.500]   There's one nice lady who works in Verizon HQ.
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.460]   And when you're big trouble on social media, don't we know?
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.660]   Lynn, don't you advise your people, right?
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.460]   She calls you and says, "What can we do to help you?"
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.300]   And I said, "What you can do to help me?"
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.980]   I said, "You're very nice, but your company is the spawn of Satan."
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.980]   I wanted a horse.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.980]   I never want to see you again.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.500]   The account hasn't died.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.020]   I want you to kill the account forever.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.660]   And she was very nice at accommodating and did it.
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:28.460]   Why is it so hard to have that be the standard for customer service?
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.460]   Well, and why do you have to have half a million Twitter followers to get it done?
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.460]   Exactly.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.460]   So, bye bye Verizon.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.460]   Bye bye Verizon mobile.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.460]   Bye bye.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:40.460]   Bye bye.
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.460]   Oh, they took up the nice lady big guns.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.900]   I got the nice lady from Comcast a couple of years ago because I was tweeting and really
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:52.180]   unhappy with the customer service, as you know.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:55.260]   And the funny thing is, I thought the nice lady was going to take care of me.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:57.460]   Mostly she just basically said, "Could you stop tweeting?"
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:04.980]   And I thought, "Well, this is really changed."
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.460]   From Frank Elias and in Comcast Cares, when they really didn't, like they said, "Okay,
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.100]   let's see if we can fix this."
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.180]   They've really come full circle now to just, you know, all we really want you to do is
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:14.420]   just stop talking about it.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.260]   What do we have to do to get you to stop tweeting?
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.260]   We're not going to fix anything.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.540]   We just want you to stop tweeting, please.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.020]   The nice ladies don't get paid enough.
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.460]   I need to pay them more.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.460]   No, no, no.
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:24.660]   She's very nice.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.660]   No, they actually hire people who sound nice.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.660]   Oh, and I didn't want it.
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:35.060]   With no one in this, I went cycle with no one, but I did say, "I met my edge folks."
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.060]   This is obvious.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.060]   This is easy.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.060]   So you went to AT&T.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.060]   I was already on AT&T.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:45.100]   It's where my unlimited account was.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.540]   And I had shared stuff there, so I just added it there.
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.940]   And I reduced a gig and I saved money and it's wonderful.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:51.940]   I'm happy.
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:57.020]   I've shared Verizon Fios and I'm happy with that all at all.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:00.740]   But Verizon Mobile is just a spot of Satan.
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:01.900]   I think they all suck.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.900]   Come on.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.900]   Can we just admit this?
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.900]   They all do.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.900]   It's not.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.020]   The people in the AT&T story, there's one friend of mine named Hugo who's been very helpful
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.020]   through Twitch.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:14.660]   Hey, friend of AT&T.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:20.340]   I just found them, yes, they're all problems, the companies, but all at all, the AT&T people
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.700]   I've dealt with have all at all been nicer and more competent.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.220]   There's a different culture there.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.780]   The Verizon culture is we're number one.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.780]   Right.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:31.140]   AT&T was nasty until they got the iPhone.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:37.300]   And I think that they, somehow we're influenced by Apple, whether explicitly or implicitly
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.020]   to be a little nicer.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.700]   And then T-Mobile used to be really nice, but then, you know--
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:47.500]   You know, I ran it to really loud and wanted to go there, but then we have a story of the
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.500]   rundown, right?
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.500]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.220]   They had a very big year added a lot.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.420]   I think 8 million customers.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.420]   Very good year.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.380]   I've never had a problem with T-Mobile.
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:59.740]   I've been a T-Mobile customer even before they were T-Mobile back in the days when they
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:00.740]   were omnipoint.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.740]   I don't know if any of you people are omnipoint.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:03.740]   Wow.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:04.740]   I have a particular--
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:05.740]   I have a particular--
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.740]   Singular was-- it became AT&T.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:08.740]   Oh, right.
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.060]   Singular was AT&T, right?
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.780]   But of course, T-Mobile's Deutsche Telecom now fully, I think fully owned and operated by
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:15.780]   Deutsche Telecom.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:20.020]   Wow, they were kind of partially owned subsidiary.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.900]   Well, there's-- no, there's nothing-- I don't think there's anything wrong with T-Mobile,
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:29.100]   but I think that they've quite successfully painted themselves as for the little guy and
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:34.500]   John Lager is so good at, you know, being a Donald Trump of cell phone CEOs.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:40.260]   Telling it like it is, sticking it to the man, and now we find out-- no, you know what?
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.260]   He's the man.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:43.460]   Because what do you do, Leo?
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.540]   What do you do?
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:52.700]   You remember that T-Mobile offered this binge on service, which seems on the face of it
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.700]   to be great.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:57.580]   I mean, it's a complete violation of network neutrality, but I can understand why no one's
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.980]   ever going to say that because they're thrilled because they have, you know, no bandwidth--
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:07.180]   no limit on-- bandwidth caps on Netflix and a lot of video sites, music sites too, like
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.820]   20 music services.
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:13.300]   And I have to admit, as a T-Mobile customer-- by the way, five customers do not get this.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:20.260]   But as a T-Mobile customer on one of my phones, I freely listen to Google Music and Pandora
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:23.460]   and Spotify and not ever think about it, how it is just going to impact my bandwidth
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.620]   caps, but it's not.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:29.580]   But there was fine print in this binge on thing.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:35.860]   One of the things they said is that if you're one of the services that we provide binge
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:43.260]   on as a binge on supplier, we're going to--
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:50.580]   down sample your bit rate streams to the 480p, which will be fine on most smartphones.
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:51.580]   That's fine.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:56.380]   480p is kind of DVD quality.
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:01.700]   But the EFF has confirmed now, and they published an article on their website EFF.org, that
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:08.780]   in fact, there's no special treatment for binge on providers that every video stream
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:14.820]   is now being down sampled to 480p.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:19.820]   So by the way, this thing is a terrible term for this.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:24.020]   It's almost as bad as net neutrality, which is called zero-rated.
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.980]   Zero-rated means you don't count against bandwidth caps.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:28.980]   Don't know where that term comes from.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:35.380]   So even if you haven't become zero-rated by T-Mobile, you're still going to get downward
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.540]   sampled.
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:42.620]   So they-- EFF actually tested this, and they really went through some effort to make this
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.540]   test fair and objective.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:53.660]   And in every case, no matter what video you were watching-- and by the way, it's not really
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:57.020]   optimized or even downward sampled to 40p.
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.100]   It's throttled.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:03.780]   What T-Mobile actually does is just throttle all video streams and counts on the provider
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:08.820]   to notice and offer a lower quality stream.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:14.900]   So all HTML5 video streams, if you're on T-Mobile, are throttled to 1.5 megabits.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:15.900]   Period.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:19.180]   So it's not just YouTube.
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:20.180]   Everybody.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.180]   Everybody.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:26.100]   And if you were a provider that didn't pay attention to that, it would just stutter and
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:30.220]   stop and buffer because they don't do any optimization.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:34.700]   They're counting on Netflix and YouTube to say, oh, I see your only 1.5 megabits will
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.220]   offer a 40p stream.
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:43.340]   So what that means is if you're trying to watch an HD stream of Vars-- actually, our
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.820]   HD stream-- oh, that's 720p.
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:49.820]   If you're trying to watch our HD stream, it'll just say, oh, you're watching HTML5 stream,
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.820]   1.5 megabits.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:51.820]   That's it.
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:52.820]   That's all you get.
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:56.220]   And our stream's going to buffer and stutter because we don't-- it depends who you're watching,
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.540]   which of our providers.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.820]   The new stream, I think, handles that well.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.260]   Some others don't.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:05.660]   So it's up to the customer, in our case, to choose a lower quality stream.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:08.420]   So maybe if you're a T-Mobile customer and you notice all of a sudden, Twitch stream
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:09.620]   starts to buffer a lot.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.620]   That's because of what T-Mobile's doing.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.380]   There's no optimization.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:20.340]   It just-- the only thing Benjean does is it throttles all HTML5 video streams down to
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.660]   1.5 megabits.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:26.180]   Period.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.180]   So how evil is that?
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.060]   Yeah, how evil is that?
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:35.620]   Well, OK, I'm going to make it-- I'll speak on behalf of T-Mobile.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:41.700]   So of course, one of the big threats to a mobile network is heavy bandwidth use because
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:45.740]   you're using the bandwidth that goes to the head end of the cell tower that you're using
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.140]   on the LTE.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:51.500]   And that costs some money because they have to put a certain amount of bandwidth out to
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:52.500]   each cell tower.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.700]   And if there's a lot of people watching video on that cell tower, that cell tower's not
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:59.020]   going to perform well, so they have to put more bandwidth in it costs some money.
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.460]   So they're saying, look, we're just going to limit everything to 1.5 megabits.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.460]   That's fine.
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.460]   There's plenty.
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.180]   And just leave it at that.
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.180]   But they did those.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.740]   They spun it as if they're doing some wonderful thing for customers.
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:09.740]   They're not.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.740]   No.
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:11.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:12.940]   And they're especially not.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:17.220]   I mean, I'm a T-Mobile customer who has unlimited data, right?
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.220]   So--
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:22.220]   Well, that's also a lie because they do limit it.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.220]   They say them.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.220]   Not more.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.220]   They throttle it.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.220]   They throttle you at some point.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.340]   They don't say, oh, you've had too much stop.
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.660]   They just slow you down.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:31.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:32.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:38.100]   Well, I used to notice it before it was really explicit, like once you reached a 5 gigabit
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.100]   to something like that.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.100]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.100]   Right.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.140]   But I don't notice it quite as much.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:45.660]   But again, with the unlimited, I'm expecting unlimited.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:47.620]   Why am I getting 480p?
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.500]   I know you can opt out.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.500]   You can opt out.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:55.020]   But they didn't make that-- they didn't make that really clear at first, up front.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:12:00.100]   And on the website, it's not that easy to find.
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:07.060]   So I mean, for the customer who has the quote unquote unlimited plan, it kind of sucks,
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:08.060]   right?
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:16.420]   That's exactly-- EFF says what T-Mobile should do is make Bingjaun opt in instead of opt out.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:20.460]   And they should also disclose that if you opt in, all your video traffic from every provider
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.460]   will be throttled.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.460]   Right.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.780]   They should certainly be transparent about it.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:27.780]   I mean, I double-advocate.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:32.180]   If I were-- I have T-Mobile, the coverage isn't great.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.700]   It's not very fast in some places.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:34.940]   It doesn't exist in some places.
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:39.660]   And I accept that as part of being on a smaller network.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:44.220]   I mean, there's a difference between the video just stopping cold and the video being
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.900]   lower quality.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:46.900]   Right?
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:47.900]   I mean--
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:48.900]   That's my problem is--
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.100]   --where the quality's not good.
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.820]   I mean, Jeff's in a hotel room, and he's on Wi-Fi.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.540]   And the quality's not great on Skype.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:55.540]   Right?
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.740]   Like, this is kind of part of being in the world.
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.740]   Right?
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.700]   Am I being a T-Mobile apologist here?
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:04.140]   I do think that they should be upfront about what that-- the optimization is actually throttling.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.140]   Right.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:12.740]   I think what happened was if you kind of dissect it is they sat down and they said,
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.060]   "John, people are using way too much.
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.060]   Everybody's watching Netflix now.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.060]   It's 40% of our traffic.
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.060]   We've really got to do something about this.
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.420]   What we would like to do is just throttle video.
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.500]   But that's going to-- if we say to people, we're going to throttle.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.220]   The final video, that's going to be a huge black mark.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:30.660]   We need to think of a way we could spin this that sounds like a plus, and that's why they
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:32.260]   invented Bin John.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:36.840]   Bin John is a fabrication to cover up what they're actually doing, which is to protect
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.840]   their network.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.180]   But it makes people feel good.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.820]   Oh, I'm getting unlimited bandwidth on my Netflix.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:43.820]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:47.140]   But really, what they're doing is they're throttling video.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:48.940]   That's what's really happening.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:51.060]   So that's where I have a little bit of a problem.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.300]   I'm still a T-Mobile customer.
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.340]   I love T-Mobile.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:55.340]   I don't know.
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:56.340]   You know what's interesting?
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:01.340]   If I'm using Google Fire and I'm using T-Mobile, by the way, switches instantaneously between
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:05.820]   Wi-Fi, Sprint, and T-Mobile, depending on which is better and transparently.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.380]   So you don't know always what you're using.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:10.180]   But most of the time here in Petaluma, it's T-Mobile.
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.300]   I don't know if I presume I'm not a Bin John.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.540]   I'm not getting that happening.
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.620]   I should do some tests.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.340]   Can you see what cellular network you're on?
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:21.340]   Yeah, you can.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.340]   Like a fast bar?
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.940]   It says like the, say Sprint Verizon.
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:26.940]   Not in the status bar.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.540]   And the status bar always says Fi.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.540]   Okay.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:32.260]   But you could go into the cellular settings.
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.420]   At least I think so.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:34.420]   Let me check.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:35.420]   Let me make sure.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.420]   I thought you couldn't.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.420]   I thought you tried to and couldn't.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.420]   Oh, maybe you're right.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:39.780]   Yeah, I don't think you did.
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:41.500]   Why did I think I knew that?
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.140]   Maybe I don't know that.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.140]   You're right.
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.140]   It's not there.
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:46.140]   Huh.
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.580]   I thought I knew that I was on T-Mobile most of the time.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.380]   I guess I don't know.
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.140]   And that's, there's a good reason for that because you're not, it moves around.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:15:00.420]   I, yeah, I don't know where I am.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.420]   But on my, my iPhone's T-Mobile.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.340]   I like T-Mobile very handy.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:07.860]   So in, in Twitter, Bredch-alty says the binge on is optional and also says that the un-lunar
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:11.620]   plan is truly unlimited and not thwattles unless there is congestion.
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:13.620]   That's odd.
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:14.620]   Well, okay.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.940]   Who's a nice guy?
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:21.460]   Yeah, it does also work for John Ledger.
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.260]   So, or work with John Ledger.
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:27.820]   So, I consider that a PR response.
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.020]   Although he, I don't think he's, is officially an employee of T-Mobile.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:34.140]   Anyway, I think this is important for people to understand.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:42.620]   Thank you, EFF, for doing the test and figuring this out.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.700]   Are you going to buy a Ford?
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.180]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis?
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:49.180]   Oh, I know Jeff is in the market.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.180]   We should set people up.
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:51.180]   I'm in the market.
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.180]   The car is dying.
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.340]   He needs a new car fast.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.340]   He will not buy a car that doesn't have Android Auto in it.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.540]   Well, I think I'll give it up.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:05.900]   Ford says their 2017 models will all have car play in Android Auto.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:07.900]   If mine will last that long, I don't think it will.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:10.180]   Yeah, because that's the fall, right?
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:15.140]   All 2017 Ford models sold in North America with the company Sync 3 infotainment platform.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:19.220]   I guess they don't all have Sync 3, but if it has Sync 3, you will get car play in Android
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.420]   Auto.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.600]   And this is really good news.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:27.180]   You could buy a 2016 model now and you will be able to upgrade later in the year.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:31.420]   Well, some people have said that about some models and then it turns out the hardware isn't
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.420]   ready for that.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:38.660]   So I want to see that like in practical writing, but that's, you know, you can upgrade Teslas.
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.580]   Why can't you upgrade every other car?
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:45.140]   But why, well, you can, you know, Ford will give you a ring into the dealer now.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.660]   Actually, I remember my old Ford Sync.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:49.900]   You could download an update and put it on a USB key and plug it into the Ford.
[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:50.900]   I liked my Ford.
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:52.900]   But I did.
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:58.100]   Yeah, I'm thinking my Audi at least runs out in the fall.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.260]   I'm on the list to get a Tesla.
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:05.540]   But Tesla doesn't, why doesn't Tesla do car play in and because it has its own Android,
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.540]   right?
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.540]   Yeah, this guy's own thing.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:12.780]   But see, when I, the story that amazed me today was that was that the Ford and Android,
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.260]   I mean, Ford and did that happen?
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:16.260]   Did they announce it?
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.260]   No, Ford and Google.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.260]   No Alexa Amazon.
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:24.260]   Oh, yeah, you could talk to your Echo.
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.660]   Okay, that's interesting.
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:26.660]   Yeah.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.660]   Yeah, that is that Echo over.
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:32.940]   Okay, Google and Echo coming in to be a major part in cars.
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.260]   That's really interesting.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.700]   Well, okay.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.380]   But okay, I have to read this.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.620]   So that's just the Alexa technology or you actually have to have that device?
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.060]   No, you have to have that device.
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:49.420]   It's not putting Echo in your car.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:55.980]   You can say to your Echo, so if you have an Amazon Echo, I do, I can say start my car.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.980]   From in the house.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:57.980]   From in the house.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:02.900]   I already can because I have automatic on my car, I can say how much gas is left.
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:03.900]   I can do that now.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.700]   I can say, hey, hey, Echo, how much gas is left?
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.220]   And they'll say you have half a tank.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:13.760]   So this is just extending that to say, hey, Echo, start my car.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.800]   What is the range of my vehicle?
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.180]   How many miles can I go?
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:24.800]   While in the car using app links, this means you have Alexa on your phone, I guess, you
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.940]   can control the house.
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:34.740]   But it doesn't sound like the voice recognition in the Ford is going to be Amazon Echo.
[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:35.940]   That's what I was originally thinking.
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:37.300]   I thought, hey, nice.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.820]   Oh, I see.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:43.740]   I thought it was like Amazon was going to become the voice of your car.
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.740]   They'll be kind of in it.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.720]   They'll be in interface to the Echo, I guess.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.720]   Oh, I see.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.720]   Okay.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720]   Well, here, let's see.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.720]   Here's a YouTube video.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.720]   Okay.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.720]   Now everybody who has an Echo, turn it off.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:55.720]   Hello.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.960]   Alexa, ask my Ford for range and charge status.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:07.760]   You currently have an electric range of 10.3 miles, gas range of 386.7 miles.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.600]   Alexa, ask my Ford to start my car.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.900]   The start command has been sent to your vehicle.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:19.020]   This is if you live in the winter areas when you want to warm up the car, right?
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:21.460]   I like your garage doors open.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:22.460]   Yeah.
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.300]   Now she has the Alexa app on her phone.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:29.300]   Alexa, ask the garage to open.
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.140]   Ask the garage to open.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:35.060]   Please open the garage has said no.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.700]   You garage it now.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:38.700]   I'm sorry, Sally.
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:39.700]   I can't do that.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.140]   How open open the bed.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:42.140]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.920]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:50.000]   Are you happy that that Mark Zuckerberg has declared that his goal in 2016 is to add a
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.560]   Jarvis to his home?
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.560]   You saw my response?
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.560]   Yes.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.840]   You've come right over.
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.640]   Yeah, that's a pretty cool project.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.240]   So tell it what what is the deal with this?
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.000]   So it's a real right.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   Go ahead.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   Go ahead.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   Go ahead.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.240]   He picks a project that he's going to do, right?
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.640]   He learned Mandarin.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   He shot chickens.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.640]   I like your name.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   He's just like, you like whatever.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   He killed us all food.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.640]   You.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   No, I like shot chickens.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.640]   I think that's good.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.200]   No, he right, right.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.200]   He produced his own chicken.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.200]   He's an orange.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.200]   That's good.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.200]   Right.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.200]   Right.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:29.920]   Matt cuts does every 30 days, Zuck does every year.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:37.040]   So he announced his 2016 project is to build a Iron Man-esque Jarvis assistant.
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.040]   Yeah?
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.120]   And he said he talked about it as Jarvis.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.360]   By the way, he just put this in his perspective.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:50.960]   He also says, I'm going to run 365 miles this year, which is a mile a day.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.320]   I don't think that that's not well.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320]   Okay.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.960]   Wait, you don't think that's it?
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.840]   Yeah, we should talk later.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:05.440]   Well, it's not like I'm running a mile a day, but so, so, and he's going to, I gather
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.680]   going to code this himself.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:12.680]   Let's learn.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.680]   He wants to learn.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.960]   I mean, you know, listen, talk about jealousy about other people's love.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.440]   I mean, he also has like a, you know, a team of some of the smartest engineers in the
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.440]   world.
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.640]   Yeah, you got to figure they're going to come over and help.
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.800]   Could help him out a bit, you know?
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:30.720]   You know, it's cool about this though, is that so he posts this on Facebook and people
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.520]   respond and then he responds to them.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.520]   Did he respond to you?
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:38.840]   Well, he, within 30 seconds, he liked my comment, which I, that was, that was all I wanted.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.840]   That was, that was wonderful.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.280]   So how big is the team that's liking comments?
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.280]   I was his team.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.280]   Oh, no, I think it's him.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.280]   Are you?
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.280]   No, it's not.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.280]   I think it's a team.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:52.520]   Come on, Lynn, you can sell companies on exactly this.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.960]   He's not going to be able to handle all of that traffic on his own.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.960]   Oh, he pretty does it.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.680]   He doesn't, very sporadically is the thing.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.720]   Now this, this comment, he actually answered more than usually does.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.720]   He answered a lot of people.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.720]   He died of this one.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:10.240]   Mistake I make is when I, when I respond to a Zuck post, the notifications just kill
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.240]   me for days.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.880]   Oh, cause you get notifications of people liking your response.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.040]   Well, that and everybody else who responded to it, somebody else responded to the same
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.040]   post.
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.040]   Oh, you're going to want to know this, aren't you?
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.040]   Oh, God.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.840]   And so it's, it's disastrous.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:23.840]   So that's a tip.
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.680]   You get, you know, of course you immediately get the scrollable response.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.320]   Sculptable was right in there after I was.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:34.560]   See, I would never in a million years think of responding to a Mark Zuckerberg post like
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.720]   he cares in my response.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720]   You at least know him.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.720]   You've interviewed him.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.720]   Same with scoble.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   You guys know each other.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.560]   Well, scoble is actually his Facebook friend.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.640]   I'm not.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.440]   He befriended him.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.440]   He befriended.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.440]   Yes.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   Wow.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:58.640]   Who on his team did that?
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   We love you, Robert.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.640]   We love you.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:01.640]   Just to be clear.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:03.640]   Robert does his own tweeting and Facebooking.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:08.960]   I pro yes, there's no team for Robert and Jeff as well or me.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.760]   I don't, I don't have a team.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.560]   Gina has a team.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:16.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.560]   My minions.
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.560]   My minions.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:20.560]   Massive team.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:25.440]   Let's just say I was not building a personal assistant the first year of my child's life.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.440]   So kudos to you.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:28.440]   No, that's a good point.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:33.040]   And he even mentions how the personal assistant is going to help raise Max.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:39.840]   Well, he said, let him know if something's going on in her room, which I mean, you know,
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.120]   there's like monitors for that.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.040]   Like regular people use baby monitors.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.040]   Mark.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.520]   But I'm sure there'll be some sort of baby monitor.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.760]   Max appears to be drawing a picture on her wall with poop.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.960]   Oh, if I could have a smellometer for my daughter, that would be amazing.
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.960]   That could be done.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.360]   You know what?
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:01.480]   If Mark Zuckerberg would devote a year of his life to that because you never want to open
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.160]   the door and be like, oh, what happened in here?
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:06.160]   Exactly.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.160]   Oh, I had the worst.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.960]   We are our beloved wonderful cat is diabetic.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.160]   Oh, not really well.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.160]   Sorry.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.160]   Right.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.160]   So I walked down yesterday.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:15.160]   You don't want to hear the story.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.480]   No, I want to hear the story.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.800]   I walked down and she shot on the shit colored floor.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.600]   Oh, so you can't tell.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.600]   Okay.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:23.600]   So here's a little tip.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.840]   It was a bad.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.720]   Don't buy poop colored linoleum.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:28.720]   Does Ness have a poop alert?
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.720]   Does Ness have a poop alert?
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:31.720]   Does Ness have a poop alert?
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.360]   Pampers should have somebody saying that pampers in and head of things.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.360]   Seriously.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.360]   Seriously.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.360]   Mm.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:44.160]   Google's going to have a Internet of Things dev Summit this month, the ubiquity.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.640]   I would love to go to that.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.760]   Geez, with burrow stuff going and starting up a little.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.760]   I'd be very interested.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   Really interesting.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.760]   And weave.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760]   So it's interesting.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.680]   I like that they're kind of doing separate dev summits around like particular events.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:00.000]   Or they have the Chrome Web Summit and they're doing the weave stuff.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.480]   It seems like going to one of those might be more productive for a developer who's deep
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:09.040]   in the stuff than Google I/O, which is this giant bonanza of everything.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.040]   So would you go to your developer?
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.520]   I mean, would you go to something like this?
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.520]   Would you be interested?
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.960]   If I were, you know, had a product that I was hoping to incorporate, would I go for
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:22.960]   fun?
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.960]   Probably not.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.360]   I would go for fun for something like the Chrome Web Summit.
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.440]   I would go for fun for something that I'm building on the Web.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.680]   If I were building a piece of hardware that was, I hope to incorporate this technology,
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.680]   I definitely would go.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:37.200]   So Google I/O, I would go for fun because it's a press event and it's a show.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.360]   These things are like they're down and dirty.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.280]   You're building something here.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.680]   You're going to get early access to stuff.
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.040]   You're going to have access to Googlers.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.360]   I mean, sure, I would go for fun, but I wouldn't book my trip for sure unless I, you know,
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.760]   this was something I were building in my life.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.440]   You could talk to Crispy Ucello developer advocate.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.440]   Look at this guy.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.440]   There's one.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.440]   His name is Crispy.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.400]   Oh, you got all of it.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.400]   Nice.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.600]   I'm so jealous.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.400]   I wouldn't want to name like a Crispy Ucello.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.960]   That may have been a change.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.160]   You too can have that name.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.080]   You could Crispy Jarvis.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:19.200]   Mom, Dad, it could be yours.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.200]   This would be fun.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.200]   This is January 11th.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.200]   It's coming up next week.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.520]   And there is a live stream.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.520]   So you know what?
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.520]   You could watch it.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.520]   Yeah, that's, I would check on the live stream.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.800]   I don't know if I, if I want to sit down with a human being and say, help me debug this
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:37.400]   problem, I'm stuck on something very specific.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   That's when it's really useful for developers.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:53.040]   Google paid a board member $149 to buy her company and she's giving it all to charity.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.040]   I'm afraid.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.040]   And her husband is too.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.040]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.040]   Now I'm impressed.
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:00.040]   And her husband is too.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:03.040]   What did her husband say?
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.480]   He's coming to you.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.480]   He's a Stanford.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.480]   She's a board member and it basically acquired her to head cloud activities.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.080]   So her name is Diane Green.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.920]   She's got some brass at the.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:25.560]   She created a startup called Bebop Technologies and she in the acquisition, which was $380
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:31.680]   million acquisition, she got about $149 million in Google or Alphabet stock.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.040]   But she's donating it to charity.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.040]   Amazing.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.840]   Yeah, it's incredible.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   It's incredible.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.480]   I mean, she had already made her money.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:43.200]   So you know, but it's incredible that she's doing it.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.720]   It is, but it also, you know, alleviates any confusion because she's also.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.720]   Yeah, there may be.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:51.720]   Yeah, there may be reasons why it's a good idea.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.760]   But still, I don't want to take away from it.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.920]   It's all around.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.560]   Yeah, it is.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.880]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.400]   You're getting a new iPhone, getting a new Apple phone, getting a new Android phone.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.640]   Maybe you want to go to Google, you know, I know I still know a lot of people have a
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:14.840]   Nexus 6, that big old whale of a phone, the Shamu, and they've got to be eyeing this,
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.080]   you know, the 6P or the 5X.
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:21.160]   This is a great way to sell your old phone, get cash for it, and get the new phone.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:29.880]   It's at Gazelle.com, trading your old device for cash or buy a certified pre-owned device.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:35.100]   Now, you can't get a Nexus there, but they will sell you iPhones, the 4S through the 6
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:36.100]   and the 6P.com.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:40.780]   They'll say iPads, standard Air and Mini models, and you can get Samsung Galaxy phones there
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:41.780]   for a good, good price.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:46.020]   In fact, this is a really good time to do it because there's, you know, there's being
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.020]   flooded with old phones.
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:49.220]   There's people buy the new phones that just came out.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:52.380]   So, you're going to get the best value on certified pre-owned devices.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:54.020]   And there's no risk here.
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:59.260]   They run them through a 30-point rigorous inspection process that everything from, you
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:03.340]   know, phone calls, data, everything, but also checking for scratches on the glass, stuff
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:04.340]   like that.
[01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:06.540]   They're always in perfect working order and great shape.
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.620]   Actually, you get to choose what shape you want.
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:13.140]   If you want to save money, you get a little bit more signs of wear, but nothing serious.
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:17.140]   And even then, you still have a 30-day return.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.820]   So you're never at risk.
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:22.700]   The nice thing is, if you're getting a device at Gazelle.com, you're not going to extend
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:23.700]   your contract.
[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:27.460]   There's no carrier contract, but they, of course, will work with all the major carriers,
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:30.460]   AT&T and Verizon and T-Mobile and Sprint.
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:31.740]   I am a fan.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:32.740]   Gazelle.
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:33.740]   There's plenty of device there.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:34.740]   Smart thing to do.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.420]   Why throw those devices in a drawer where they gather dust?
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:39.580]   You wouldn't do that with $100 bills.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:42.620]   Why would you do it with an old device worth more than $100 bucks?
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:44.180]   Sell it to Gazelle.
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:46.380]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.220]   Give new life to used electronics.
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:54.860]   Train them in for cash or buy certified pre-owned or both.
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:56.340]   G-A-Z-E-L-E.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:59.660]   Visit Gazelle.com.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.380]   Today, Jeff Jarvis is here.
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:05.260]   In Miami, visiting the nice warm day in Miami, I'm sure.
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:06.260]   Yes, it is.
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:08.260]   It's pleasant.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.260]   I like the tropics.
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:10.260]   I've decided.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.260]   I like humidity.
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:14.860]   I like heat, especially in the winter.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:16.580]   Gina Trapani in Brooklyn.
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:19.340]   Thank you for being here.
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:22.900]   Her Makerbase has its new URL.
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:24.100]   You told us this last month.
[01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:25.100]   Makerbase.co.
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:26.100]   Easy to find.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.100]   Thank goodness.
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.100]   No more.sc.
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.100]   No more.sc.
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.580]   I thought that was clever, though.
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:31.580]   Makerbase.
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:33.380]   It was fine for the first month, right?
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:35.380]   It was good for launch.
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:36.380]   It was good enough for launch.
[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.820]   Then you got to get serious.
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:40.740]   Then you got to get serious.
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:45.620]   And Lindy Johnson, consultant, columnist for ebony.com.
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:48.740]   Great to have you back here again.
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.660]   Great to be here.
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:51.660]   Hey.
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.660]   Great to be here.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.420]   We're talking about Google and Facebook.
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:59.020]   Project Sunroof has been expanded, which is really nice because this was a very limited
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:00.900]   area, but now more areas can do it.
[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:05.820]   This is Google's way of finding out if you would -- how much money you would save by
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:10.220]   solarizing your home.
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:14.140]   So it'll tell you, and I've just done this on my house, 1,740 hours of usable sunlight
[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:16.420]   a year.
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:17.700]   Lots of space.
[01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:20.500]   They do 3D modeling of my roof in nearby trees.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.140]   4,919 square feet available for solar panels.
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:26.380]   I could save $13,000 over 20 years.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:30.020]   Actually, I already knew this because we've gone to solar city and we have solar panels
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:31.140]   in our house.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:35.660]   And they used a version of this that they only they had access to.
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:37.940]   Well, now you can do it.
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:38.940]   So if you --
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:39.940]   Cool, use of technology.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:42.580]   It's such a -- I mean, thank you, Google, again.
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:45.180]   I mean, it's in Google's interest.
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.460]   They're heavily invested in solar.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:47.460]   So let's say that.
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:51.780]   But it's also just such an interesting use of their aerial shots, and they calculate whether
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.020]   the trees are in the shade.
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:55.020]   They'll tell you if you're not going to save money.
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:32:00.700]   And I saw an example of someone with someone's house was kind of in the shade of trees.
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:01.700]   I tried my house.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.700]   I'm not in the area.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:06.380]   And I tried my family who live in North Carolina or just outside the Raleigh area.
[01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:07.860]   So I just wanted everywhere.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:09.780]   Oh, so it's not everywhere yet?
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:10.780]   It's not everywhere yet.
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:11.780]   No, no, some places.
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:15.020]   It's part of New Jersey, but it doesn't work for me yet.
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:17.500]   Oh, that's too bad.
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:18.500]   And then what's interesting --
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.500]   It's a whole matter of data.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.500]   You know, that we can't --
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:28.140]   And what's interesting is that they also have then a sponsored listing of solar providers
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.140]   in your area.
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:32.740]   And I notice our provider, Sun City, is not on this list because they didn't apparently
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:34.180]   pay.
[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:41.700]   See this sponsored right here kind of hidden away.
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700]   But that's useful still.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:47.180]   And just, you know, you should know that that's an ad as opposed to all the solar providers
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:50.860]   in your area because it's leaving out with one that we used.
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:57.740]   Still, I think a great -- you know, hey, if you can unite commerce and public benefit,
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:00.140]   that's a great thing to do.
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:04.460]   Why not?
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:05.460]   Think with Google.
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.460]   What does think with Google?
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:12.580]   It's like an insights -- it's an insights marketing kind of.
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:17.460]   So they do like market research and they look at different consumer behaviors.
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:21.580]   So this is an article I think with Google, why gamers should be part of your audience
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:22.580]   strategy?
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:27.780]   Do you know how many gaming devotees you have in your core audience?
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:31.740]   So you can -- I mean, it's just an article that can you actually find out some of this
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:32.740]   stuff?
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:37.020]   They probably have a PDF report.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:40.820]   Usually they do it with -- they do these studies with market research companies.
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:43.220]   Oh, and this is for YouTube.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:44.660]   It's so smooth.
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:52.060]   So the Ipsos says that YouTube gamers are more likely to purchase certain goods than others
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.380]   in the general population.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:58.100]   So what they're calling a YouTube gamer is even someone who sits and watches game videos
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.100]   all day.
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:00.100]   Oh.
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:03.980]   Like my five-year-old son, he doesn't do it all day, but he does.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:04.980]   Yep.
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:05.980]   He doesn't watch.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.820]   Our 13-year-old does it all day, or would if we allowed him to.
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:09.820]   Yeah.
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:10.820]   Watches.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:11.820]   Watches other field play games.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:12.820]   Yes.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:13.820]   Yeah.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:14.820]   On the cruise ship, I had to take away his iPhone.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:18.380]   He's like, "It's -- we're in the Bahamas."
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:20.980]   There's a -- you're going to kiss a dolphin.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:24.420]   What are you looking at Minecraft videos for?
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:27.220]   But it's just -- you know, it's -- they don't watch TV.
[01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:30.540]   They -- I mean, I was watching Gilligan's Island.
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:31.540]   It was actually -- Yeah.
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.540]   Which is better.
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:33.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:34.540]   Right.
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:35.540]   Right.
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.540]   Well, this is interesting.
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:42.180]   So if you're a brand or you have something to sell, this is probably a site you want to
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:45.180]   know about ThinkWithGoogle.com.
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:47.620]   Hmm.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:49.180]   Hmm.
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:50.660]   Hmm.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:54.300]   But it tends to be Google properties.
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:56.660]   It looks like this is like YouTube.
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:34:57.660]   Okay.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:58.660]   Okay.
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:34:59.660]   Okay.
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:04.980]   Google has invested in a Berlin startup called Factory.
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:07.500]   It's a -- it's not a big story.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:11.380]   It's a incubator or a space.
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:12.380]   Okay.
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:17.780]   So I've been there with Wolftansa, their innovation hub.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:18.780]   And it's very nice.
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:19.980]   It's amazing space.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:20.980]   It's cool.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:25.540]   So -- but all the point there is that Google is putting more money into Germany.
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:30.260]   This was a slow year -- last year, it was a slow year for investment and acquires from
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.260]   all the big -- all the majors.
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:34.020]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.860]   What is that -- what do you think that means?
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:39.500]   There's nothing left to learn that.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:43.740]   I mean, money's not tighter than it was, I don't think.
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:44.740]   No.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:49.060]   Maybe -- maybe it's just harder to find that key employee.
[01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:52.180]   Did you like the Google Doodle?
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:53.500]   I didn't see it on New Year's Day.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:54.500]   I missed it.
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.500]   I was busy.
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.500]   I didn't either.
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.500]   Tending a hangover.
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.180]   Yeah, I was away from the -- from the screens.
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:01.020]   So I didn't get the CD there.
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:05.060]   So there's birds on a wire.
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.580]   And they're dancing.
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:07.580]   There's turtles.
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.860]   There's turtles all the way down.
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:12.100]   Get it?
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:13.860]   That looks kind of like an Angry Bird.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:14.860]   That's it.
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:15.860]   They're just dancing.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:16.860]   Does anything else going to happen?
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:18.220]   Oh, you could click a video.
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:21.060]   No, that's the turtles.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.060]   Hmm.
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:23.060]   Okay.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:24.060]   Cute.
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:25.060]   Thank you.
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:26.060]   2016.
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:36.780]   Not the best one I've seen yet, but it was a baby crocodile at Duck and five turtles.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:43.900]   One of the other CES news, Google partners with speaker makers to put Google cast in
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:50.300]   big brands like Bang and Olafson, Harman Cardin, Phillips and Ankyo.
[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:51.300]   That's good.
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.220]   I love seeing Google cast everywhere.
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:37:00.300]   I use Chromecast audios and all my systems and of course Chromecast video on all my TVs.
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.100]   The audio adapter is really cool.
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.580]   So this means you don't have to buy an audio adapter.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:09.660]   If you have one of these powered speakers and they're already attached to your Wi-Fi,
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:13.940]   you'll see them and you can spend send audio just right to them.
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:15.220]   Watch out Sonos.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:22.700]   I got my first Sonos and I was just really surprised that I can't use Chromecast.
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:24.780]   I can't cast you.
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:25.780]   You can Google music.
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:27.500]   You can Google music.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.500]   You can.
[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:29.500]   Well, right.
[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:32.260]   They support Google Music, but I'm just saying like just the cast button, you know, from
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:34.260]   anywhere I just assumed.
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:39.580]   I was like, why is this so clearly very possible and not working?
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:40.580]   Yeah.
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:42.620]   Then I thought, well, I'll buy a Google cast to plug into the Sonos.
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:43.620]   Right.
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:44.620]   Cast to it.
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:45.620]   That seemed insane.
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:46.620]   It is insane.
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:50.540]   So now really, I think this is a real threat to Sonos because they're very expensive.
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.940]   Now you can spy speakers of whatever quality you want.
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:38:00.900]   You don't have to spend $600 on a speaker and put a Chromecast on and it's great.
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:07.660]   Well, there was a startup that had a really big kick startup push, a startup called Rocky.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.940]   I don't know if you guys know that.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:13.140]   ROCKI and they were doing something like that.
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:16.940]   And I know that they have a great partnership with Spotify.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:17.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:23.580]   Helping companies, helping speaker companies to be able to integrate with Spotify.
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:25.580]   So it's like a little rubber jam.
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:27.580]   It's a little rubber.
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:35.020]   And so with them, what their big deal is is the data that they get on the other end, that
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:39.820]   they could probably package up and sell to music companies.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:40.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:46.620]   See, I mean, in the long run, I think, I mean, so this is very similar to, but it's
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.620]   more expensive.
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:52.140]   It's 49 bucks to audio Chromecast, which is 35 bucks.
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:53.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:58.700]   And this works with two things, Spotify and Deezer.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:38:59.700]   Deezer.
[01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:04.380]   But I would guess that I would say you're probably better off at this point.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:05.380]   Sorry, Rocky.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:08.020]   Buying Chromecast on you.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:12.220]   Because I think it's going to be just like Chromecast video where it's going to expand
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.740]   rapidly to a lot more players.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.540]   Why not?
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:17.540]   But that's interesting.
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.580]   So you think that's why Google does this kind of thing?
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:20.980]   There's analytic value.
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:25.420]   There's useful information they gain from this.
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:27.420]   Oh, definitely.
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:30.380]   I'm really fond of that.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:31.380]   Yeah.
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:36.060]   I mean, it's like how are people using which services?
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:37.060]   What are they listening to?
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:41.260]   What do you think it knows what they're listening to?
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:42.900]   It might.
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:48.860]   But I think it's more about what services they're using and how long they're using them.
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:50.620]   How much are they using Netflix?
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.900]   How much are they using YouTube?
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:55.100]   How much are they using?
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:40:01.100]   If your surgeon came into the operating theater wearing Google cardboard, you might want to
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.780]   think twice about a surgeon.
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:11.860]   And yet Google cardboard is now being used by surgeons to perform heart surgery and actually
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:14.300]   save somebody's life.
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:19.300]   Maybe Tegan.
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.300]   Because they mapped.
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:24.420]   It was a tiny baby that had only one lung and a heart was well formed and it went into
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:29.380]   the other side of the body and very tiny, very difficult to navigate.
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:35.740]   So they did a virtual model of the space that the doctor could then.
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:40.420]   So he kind of like tours, a tour where he's going to go during surgery ahead of time.
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:41.420]   Exactly.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:42.420]   That makes sense.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:45.540]   And the screensavers are really neat projects to do 3D modeling.
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:51.180]   Same thing, 3D printing, a physical heart and lung for before infant surgery.
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:54.500]   So the surgeon could see what it's going to look like and plan his attack.
[01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:56.140]   I think that's actually very clever.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:57.140]   Wow.
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:59.060]   And this is baby Tegan.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:00.900]   The operation was a success.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:03.100]   So not during surgery.
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.100]   This is before surgery.
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.100]   No.
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:06.100]   Thank God no.
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:07.100]   Because I want go.
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:09.780]   And this is one situation where I want glass over cardboard.
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.780]   Yes.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:12.980]   I want him to see what he's looking at.
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:16.460]   No, this is really cool.
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:20.900]   This is at the Miami's Nicklaus Children's Hospital.
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:27.540]   And four-month-old Tegan Lexin was successfully operated on.
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:29.380]   Wow, that's really great.
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.900]   I'm excited.
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:33.940]   I have to say all the VR things.
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:38.820]   I mean, even just these videos I shot on the ship, which work with cardboard or gear
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:42.220]   VR or just your phone.
[01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:43.420]   It is a different experience.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:45.180]   The immersive video really is a different experience.
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:46.580]   And I think it's a nice way to do it.
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:47.740]   I had kind of had hopes.
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:53.620]   I had this fantasy with this Rico that I'd be kind of able to do vlogging.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:56.900]   And if you're somewhere where there's more to see than just you, it's great.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:58.900]   Like on the trip, it was great.
[01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:04.380]   So you would be talking to the camera and people could look around or just talking or
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:05.380]   doing something for you.
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:06.380]   Instead of just staring at me.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:07.380]   Right.
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:10.380]   The only thing is you have to kind of get used to you want to aim the camera at what you're
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.380]   talking about.
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.820]   And you realize you don't have to do that.
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:13.820]   Right.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:14.820]   It's just there.
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:15.820]   You just hold the camera.
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:20.860]   And then what I eventually kind of said is, well, if you look over there or see over
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:24.420]   there, that's and you just keep holding the camera and they can look over.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:25.940]   It's like you're talking to somebody.
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:27.700]   It's kind of cool.
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.700]   Cool.
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:30.260]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.340]   I really like that.
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:38.980]   There are, speaking of Brillo and the Internet of Things, there are some, finally some products
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:40.140]   being announced.
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:44.820]   The CES is, you know, every year we'd go to CES and we'd go to the smart home pavilion
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:47.620]   and we'd look and that would just be, well, ah, there's a lot of great stuff.
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.940]   Nothing talks to anything else.
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:54.020]   And you just have to pick one and use that.
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:43:00.620]   But Brillo, which is Google's Internet of Things and Weave, which is their language, announced
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:03.260]   at Google I/O last spring.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:05.780]   But there are some announcements at CES, apparently.
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:08.060]   This is from an article in the Verge.
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:13.340]   ASUS is announcing a smart home bridge built on Brillo.
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:18.540]   So presumably we do more than talk to other ASUS products at some point.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:20.180]   Lutron and Instion.
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:23.580]   Oh, no, this is Apple's home kit.
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:27.820]   So ASUS says they're going to do more Brillo powered stuff, stuff as well.
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:30.180]   Quick set is making a smart door lock.
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:33.260]   It connects over Weave.
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:37.860]   Marvell is making a Wi-Fi chip that speaks Weave.
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.980]   That's actually huge.
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:44.060]   And Harmon is working with other companies to build Brillo on Weave devices.
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:48.140]   So early days yet, the problem is of course it's not compatible with home kit.
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:54.900]   It's not, you know, everybody's got their own platform again.
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:55.900]   Sigh.
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:56.900]   Sigh.
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:00.100]   You know, at least Google is opening up the protocol.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.100]   Yes, right.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:02.100]   But I think--
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:04.860]   That doesn't mean anyone's going to-- Apple's going to use them.
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:05.860]   All right.
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.940]   Home automation is kind of like video editing.
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:12.100]   When people start putting video editing out on desktop and eventually on mobile devices,
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:15.460]   I thought as somebody who spent a lot of time professionally doing video editing and hating
[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:21.300]   every moment of it because it's grueling, grinding, boring work that takes forever,
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:22.820]   I thought nobody's ever going to want a video edit.
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:23.820]   And I kind of feel the same way.
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:26.660]   It's too much trouble to get smart-- a smart home working.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.340]   It's too much-- but you know what?
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.340]   Eventually people do.
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:31.060]   Now they do video edit.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:33.660]   So anyway, a subset of people video edit.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:34.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:35.660]   A lot of kids do.
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:36.660]   And I suppose this will be the same.
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:37.660]   It'll be like that.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.660]   If it can get easier enough.
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:45.700]   I'm going to get you out of here in 15 minutes.
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:46.700]   Is that right, Jeff?
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:48.460]   Oh, I'll leave you inside of that.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.700]   Well, yeah, I'm between here and out.
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:52.700]   I'll tell you what.
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:53.700]   We'll do the boss to a different dinner place.
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:54.700]   All right.
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:55.700]   Let's get you out of here.
[01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:56.700]   Let's get everybody out of here.
[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:58.700]   We'll wrap it up in a second.
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:01.740]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:02.740]   I just got an email.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:04.900]   Charge your Karma battery soon.
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.700]   Oh, I love the Karma.
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.700]   Wow.
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:08.700]   We should mention that.
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:09.700]   It's charging now.
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:10.700]   I'll otherwise that'll come off.
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:11.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:12.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:13.700]   It's really an interesting idea.
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:14.700]   It's basically a MIFI.
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:24.420]   You know, one of those credit card-sized internet devices that uses your LTE to become
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:26.500]   a hotspot.
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:29.220]   But it has-- is it pay as you go, which is nice?
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:30.620]   Pay as you go.
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:35.940]   Dever expires when you're in an airport or someplace and somebody else uses your Karma
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:39.740]   and don't worry, it's not your data that's going off elsewhere.
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.820]   You get a 100 meg gift for the fact that somebody else used your Karma being on to
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:47.700]   encourage you to keep it on in public places.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:49.740]   I didn't know that.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:50.740]   I'm using it a lot.
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:51.740]   Yeah, that's very cool.
[01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:52.740]   It's on.
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:57.700]   Yeah, I'm just today at the airport, so I got 100 megs because somebody used it.
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:59.060]   So how do they use it?
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:01.260]   Is there-- there's not a password protection?
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:05.060]   Well, no, it's-- they have a fence.
[01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:07.900]   And they have to have a Karma account.
[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.500]   They have a Karma account.
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:10.500]   Got it.
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:11.500]   Okay.
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:19.300]   And if you buy a head, you can get as low as $10 a gigabyte if you buy enough of it.
[01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:22.260]   But if you just buy a lot of cards, $14 a gigabyte.
[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:23.260]   It's based on Sprint.
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:25.940]   You can get eight devices on it.
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.140]   And the Karma app is telling me, you know, the power and the connectivity.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:30.660]   Yeah, that's what I really like.
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:32.660]   Yeah, get emails and lots of information.
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:35.180]   Yeah, and I really like that part.
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:41.340]   So right now, it says that I'm charging, right?
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:42.740]   And I have-- let's see here.
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:45.940]   I have the refort to-- oh, no.
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:47.780]   Don't do that.
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:50.420]   No, my Karma is not off.
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:51.580]   It's all of them.
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:54.340]   I hope it's on, because if it's not-- I hope it's on.
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:56.780]   So I'm now down to 16.81 gigabytes.
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:58.380]   I started the day with 18 something.
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:02.180]   So the show is to do a show of our length-- 12 gigabytes.
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:03.740]   Well, I'll say it, check.
[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:05.340]   No, no, no, no, two gigabytes.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.340]   Oh, two.
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:07.340]   Oh, that's not bad.
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:08.340]   Oh, it's not that bad.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:11.060]   It's about-- 150 bucks for the device.
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:12.660]   It takes a while to get one.
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:15.140]   I think they're caught up now.
[01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:16.140]   Okay.
[01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:18.140]   I think it was worth it.
[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:19.740]   Like Karma, Karma is very smart.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:20.740]   People, very good people.
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:21.980]   It's a social-based company.
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:24.260]   I bought it because of you.
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.260]   Actually.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:26.420]   I'm very impressed.
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:27.380]   And oh, good.
[01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:28.660]   I did have a guest connection.
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:30.220]   Look at that.
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:31.380]   On October 4th.
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:32.500]   I didn't even know I had one.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:33.380]   Yeah.
[01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:35.620]   And I have-- I bought a bunch of data,
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:38.300]   so I have 12.94 gigs left.
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:39.940]   But it doesn't expire.
[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:41.380]   That's the beautiful part.
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:42.260]   Yeah.
[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:45.140]   Yeah, and you only pay for what you-- well, you pay ahead.
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:48.820]   And if people-- and if people buy--
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:50.820]   and there goes his Karma.
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:53.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:55.980]   Such a recommendation.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:56.820]   Frozen solid.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:58.300]   We're going to get Jeff out of here just a second.
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:00.500]   But first a word from Frush Books,
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.860]   the super simple cloud accounting solution
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:05.740]   that saved my life as a freelancer is going to save yours,
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:07.300]   too, because what is it, the thing
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:10.820]   that you as a freelancer hate the most?
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:13.380]   Formatting and sending invoices.
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:15.420]   Collecting receipts, tracking expenses,
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:19.260]   following up with clients that don't pay you on time.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:23.780]   All of these things are not only a pain in the butt,
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:26.780]   they're also the thing that gets you paid.
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:28.580]   So it's a weird thing.
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:30.700]   If you don't do it, you won't get money.
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:32.460]   And you need to-- that's why you work.
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:34.820]   So you got to do it.
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:35.860]   Fresh books makes it easy.
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:37.340]   It's like you breathe a sigh of relief.
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:38.780]   Oh, thank God.
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:40.420]   At the end of the month-- every month,
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:42.300]   I'm just going, oh, I don't want to fire up word
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:45.060]   and excel and do all this and send out the invoices.
[01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:46.060]   I'd put it off.
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:47.700]   It means I wouldn't get paid.
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:50.460]   Fresh books was a lifesaver.
[01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:55.060]   I started using it in 2004.
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:57.180]   You can mail invoices, but you want to mostly email them
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:59.020]   because it's very easy for your clients to pay you.
[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:01.380]   Turns out they hate paying you as much as you hate invoicing.
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:03.700]   I mean, it's just a chore for everybody.
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:05.500]   They even have this new thing I love.
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:06.540]   I wish I'd had this.
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:09.060]   It's called, well, you can request a deposit.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:14.900]   So I was out of pocket on my airfare, my hotel till I build them.
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:16.860]   And then I would get the money back.
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:20.260]   Well, now you can actually ask for a deposit in FreshBooks.
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:22.420]   FreshBooks will be the escrow.
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:24.780]   And you don't have to cover costs out of pocket
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:26.540]   or wait till the end of a project to get paid.
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.140]   This is nice.
[01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:31.380]   If you're the kind of person that goes around doing services
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:33.940]   and you build people, now you can have the FreshBooks
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:35.580]   app on your phone.
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:39.500]   You clean the gutters or you wash the car, whatever it is you do.
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:42.100]   You show your invoice to your customer.
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:44.460]   You pop in the FreshBooks card reader,
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:49.100]   which, by the way, works with chip or swipe.
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:52.820]   Your customer dips the chip, swipes the stripe,
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:54.060]   and you get paid instantly.
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:55.500]   Right out of the box, it's so cool.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:56.420]   Do you see the invoice?
[01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:58.260]   They get it mailed to them and they pay you.
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:49:59.220]   I love this.
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:00.460]   And of course, if you ever need help,
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:03.260]   they've got the FreshBooks support rock stars.
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:04.340]   They are nice people.
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:05.660]   They're Canadian.
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:07.420]   Of course, they're nice.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:09.340]   In fact, that was really great because there's Amber.
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:11.260]   Look at that.
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:13.860]   She's the one who told me about FreshBooks.
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:16.060]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:17.980]   And you'll get 30 days free.
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:20.540]   If you mention this week in Google and how did you
[01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:21.380]   hear about it section?
[01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:25.340]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:26.660]   30 days free.
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:29.780]   But I warn you, you use it for one pay period
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:31.020]   and you will never go back.
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:33.180]   I mean, you're going to be a customer.
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:34.220]   And you'll be glad.
[01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:34.700]   You really will.
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:38.940]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:40.940]   Jeff's unfrozen.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.500]   I can't see you, but it's fine.
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:43.700]   I think I'm probably going to die again.
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:44.700]   Can I give you my number?
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:45.380]   Yes.
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:46.380]   Number.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:46.660]   Good for it.
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:48.140]   Number us.
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:51.220]   So I think I have to do this out of moral requirement
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:53.260]   because I push so many people to go to Chipotle.
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:54.500]   And we know the story that's happening.
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:57.220]   Oh, you have engineering.
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:59.420]   And so I just did it as a number.
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:05.420]   The in-store sales fell 14.6% for the quarter.
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:05.780]   Geez.
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:07.340]   Quarter of a quarter.
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:10.020]   December over December fell 50%.
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:12.060]   Make your customers sick?
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:13.340]   Half of them won't come back.
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:16.780]   And now they're being subpoenaed and a possible criminal case.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:19.220]   In one case, who knows what's going on there?
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:22.860]   Conspiracy theorists came on and said, well, it's the GMO forces.
[01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:24.900]   When they killed the GMO, that got them.
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:25.700]   No.
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:28.260]   It's not that.
[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:30.420]   And they have a good plan of what they're going to do
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:31.100]   and would look like.
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:37.380]   But this is companies, every company on Earth, whether you're--
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:38.740]   And there goes this carmago.
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:41.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:43.220]   You better chipotle to people.
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:46.020]   Yeah, we all love Chipotle.
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:46.540]   We did.
[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:47.860]   And we also loved Lee.
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:49.420]   And now they're both gone.
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:49.940]   Yeah.
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:50.780]   And I saw--
[01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:53.060]   --the jumps, the shark.
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:54.540]   Yep, they have.
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:57.140]   But Jane Lynch continues on.
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:58.100]   She does.
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:59.340]   God, we love her.
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:00.100]   Can't stop her.
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:00.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:01.180]   Can't stop her.
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.860]   I have high hopes that Chipotle is taking the steps they need to take.
[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:05.620]   I do too.
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:06.100]   Yeah.
[01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:06.620]   I do too.
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:09.580]   But until I know that day when every store has every one
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:11.220]   of these new procedures, I think
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:12.940]   we'll go back.
[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:14.060]   Yeah, and I don't think you're alone.
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:14.580]   And that's why--
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:15.020]   That's a good thing to stand.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.340]   Yeah, that's why they're--
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:17.100]   that's sad.
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:19.700]   I could put a company out of business.
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:25.100]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:26.700]   Have a great time with the Knight Foundation.
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:27.860]   Enjoy your dinner.
[01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:28.380]   Oh.
[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:28.860]   Thanks, Jeff.
[01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.740]   Never-- never-- you know, go to Chipotle.
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:32.260]   Yeah.
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:32.820]   Nope.
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:34.940]   Take your Boston Chipotle.
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:35.860]   If you don't like them.
[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:39.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:42.940]   By the way, somebody said, Chipotle, this year,
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:44.140]   Oculus Rift next year.
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:45.820]   If you make people sick, they don't come back.
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:49.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:49.740]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:50.620]   Have a great day.
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:52.060]   We'll see you next week.
[01:52:52.060 --> 01:52:52.560]   I don't.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:55.140]   Lindy Johnson, your tip of the week.
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:56.100]   It's not a tip.
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:57.140]   It's a tool.
[01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:57.980]   I guess it's a tool.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:58.980]   Good.
[01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:02.260]   It's called Sorted S-O-R-T-D.
[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:03.500]   Sorted D.
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:08.740]   It's kind of like a Trello-like interface for your Gmail.
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:11.940]   2016, I'm all about getting things done.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:14.900]   GTD, productivity, all of this.
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:17.340]   I could care less about inbox zero,
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:20.540]   but what Sorted does help me do,
[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:23.860]   it does help me to get out of my inbox
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:26.220]   and kind of look at things in lists,
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:31.660]   like what I actually need to be doing with those emails.
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:34.420]   So it takes a while to get used to.
[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:36.100]   It takes a little bit to set up.
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:40.060]   But once you get it in motion, it's really helpful.
[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:41.420]   And you can move things around.
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:43.420]   That's why I say it's like Trello.
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:46.860]   If anyone has ever used Trello for project management,
[01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:49.180]   it's quite similar to Trello.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:50.860]   But it's with your email.
[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:52.460]   Email is so broken.
[01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:55.740]   And there's so many attempts to try to solve this.
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:57.500]   I'll give this a shot.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:58.820]   I love the columns of Trello.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:01.380]   I can drag my email around like that.
[01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:01.860]   I'll try this.
[01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:02.860]   It's kind of agile.
[01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:04.180]   Agile email.
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:05.420]   Agile email, yeah.
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:06.260]   Agile email.
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:07.100]   Definitely.
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:08.420]   Just definitely.
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:12.660]   And you can change your labels around as needed as well.
[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.900]   I don't have to try this.
[01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:15.420]   That looks good.
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:17.300]   I just tried something called MixMax.
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:20.100]   And I don't have you guys ever heard of that?
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:20.420]   No.
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:21.780]   MixMax.com.
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:22.980]   It works with Gmail.
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:27.260]   And it's actually a Chrome plugin that completely kind of changes
[01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:27.700]   Gmail.
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.260]   And it apparently works with inbox as well.
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:32.380]   But I'll show you real quickly what happens when you--
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:35.380]   I'm going to create a new-- it changes the compose box.
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:41.140]   And now I have some additional things like I can track.
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:42.300]   I always don't like this.
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:44.100]   But I think in business, sometimes people
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:47.380]   want to know if-- can you take down the lower third?
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.940]   Because I can't move these.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:50.660]   Actually, I think I can.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:51.500]   There we go.
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:51.980]   No.
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:52.980]   We disappeared.
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:55.900]   Where'd it go?
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:57.060]   You just shift compose.
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:57.580]   There you go.
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:00.940]   It has a-- you can turn on tracking that will actually
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:02.860]   let you give you a notification when somebody reads
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:05.900]   your email or clicks a link in the email.
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:07.700]   You can send email like HootSuite.
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.660]   You can send email later.
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.140]   You can schedule email.
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:13.140]   And if you put-- it has slash commands.
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:15.260]   So you've entered slash in the email.
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:16.460]   You have all of these things.
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:19.940]   You can, for instance, put in a share availability calendar
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:22.060]   in there and say, hey, let's get together.
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:22.900]   Here's my calendar.
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:24.100]   And it does it automatically.
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:27.540]   Lots of stuff.
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.140]   You can insert Jiffy.
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:30.780]   Because that's my new thing is Giffy.
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:33.620]   I want to put in a gift everywhere.
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.540]   Invitations.
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:36.100]   You could put polls in your email.
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:38.220]   So if you send something out of emails,
[01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:40.780]   hey, where should we go to lunch?
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:43.380]   You can sit Chipotle anywhere else.
[01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:45.220]   And you can make a little poll.
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:46.660]   And there, there's a lot of these.
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.660]   It's really interesting.
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:51.460]   And I know, Gina, you've written skins for Gmail.
[01:55:51.460 --> 01:55:53.980]   It's a really interesting idea.
[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:54.620]   Really cool.
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:55.540]   Yeah.
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:56.780]   This one is very advanced.
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:59.060]   It's like crazy advanced.
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:00.620]   It's like a whole new product.
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.620]   Anyway, mix max.
[01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:03.260]   You can try it for free.
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:04.900]   I just did it this morning.
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:06.340]   So I have no idea.
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:10.140]   But you made me think of it as another way to--
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:12.900]   we got a fixed mail somehow.
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:15.980]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:20.220]   Um, yes, Miss Gina Trapani.
[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:21.940]   You have a pic.
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:23.660]   I got excited about bubble level.
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:26.100]   But I realized that Danny talked about bubble level.
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:27.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:28.500]   It's a Google search.
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:29.740]   I was like, so excited about it.
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:30.580]   And I was like, no.
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:32.980]   OK, so I'm in my very exciting tip.
[01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:34.060]   Danny, they meet me too.
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:34.820]   It's on this--
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:38.300]   Don't tell everybody, though, just for--
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:39.300]   Google.
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:42.940]   Google search for bubble level on your phone.
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.980]   And you will get a bubble level.
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:46.180]   The thing that will tell you--
[01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:48.020]   using your phones accelerometer to tell you
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:51.620]   whether or not something is having degrees to the left
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:52.140]   or the right.
[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:52.740]   It's amazing.
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.420]   It turns your phone into a bubble level.
[01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:57.540]   Google, is there nothing they can't do?
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:57:01.140]   It's got to be a really cool use of the search, of quick search.
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:04.340]   But so in lieu of that, my New Year's PSA
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:06.540]   is go to my account at google.com.
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:08.060]   Go through your security settings.
[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:09.020]   Change your password.
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:10.340]   Turn on two-factor auth.
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:12.940]   Make sure that your backup phone number is correct.
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:14.860]   Make sure that your backup email address is correct.
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:16.260]   Make sure that you're sharing the information
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:18.300]   that you want to share, how you want to share it.
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.660]   Just make sure your settings are up to date,
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:24.020]   because we all store stuff and are kind of even passively
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:26.540]   sharing or publishing information through using
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.980]   all these cloud services, but particularly Google.
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:31.820]   So just go and just make sure you got everything locked down.
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:33.500]   Pick a hard to guess password.
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:34.940]   Try two-factor auth.
[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:36.620]   It's a little bit of a pain, but I recommend
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:38.300]   Authy to deal with your code.
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:38.860]   I do too.
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:39.700]   You like Authy.
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:40.780]   I love it.
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:41.460]   Love Authy.
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:42.060]   Love Authy.
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:44.900]   So yeah, just take a cruise to your settings
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:50.820]   as a kind of New Year's 2016 online hygiene checkup.
[01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:54.140]   That's my not as exciting as bubble level.
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:55.620]   I love it.
[01:57:55.620 --> 01:57:58.700]   And I'm going to recommend something I've got.
[01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:02.980]   Actually, Chris, would you get my purse?
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:04.900]   You have a man purse?
[01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:05.900]   Your purse?
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:06.380]   You have a man purse?
[01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:08.980]   I can't believe I just said that.
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:11.380]   It's a satchel.
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:13.140]   It's manly.
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:16.060]   It's made out of a thick cowhide,
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:18.180]   so it doesn't look like a purse.
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:19.140]   You're red.
[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:20.260]   So great.
[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:22.180]   It's very Indiana Jones-ish.
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:24.060]   That just came out.
[01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:25.460]   Is it not there?
[01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:28.580]   Is it not hanging on the hat rack?
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:31.140]   Where you put one would put one's purse.
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:32.460]   Maybe it's on the floor.
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:35.420]   All right, it doesn't matter, because inside it
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:38.060]   is my tiny hardware firewall.
[01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:38.900]   And I had mentioned this.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:40.700]   I wanted to bring this on the cruise,
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:42.460]   because we were using Open Wi-Fi.
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.180]   And I read a terrifying article about how dangerous--
[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:48.900]   see, this doesn't look like a purse, does it?
[01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:50.060]   Own it, baby.
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:52.300]   That's a nice-- that's a nice look at that purse.
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:52.700]   That is--
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:53.700]   That is--
[01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:54.020]   That is a purse.
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:55.380]   That is definitely a man purse.
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:58.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:58.380 --> 01:58:59.620]   It's very masculine.
[01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:01.980]   It looks like I ride horses.
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:03.260]   It does.
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:04.820]   But you need a MERS if you're going
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:06.780]   to carry around things like this all the time.
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:09.660]   But I do carry this around all the time now.
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:11.780]   I ordered this for the cruise, and it didn't come in time.
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:13.380]   And it was a little bit disappointed.
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:17.860]   This costs, I think, $91, but you get a year's worth of VPN.
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:19.540]   Actually, it's the other way around.
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:23.620]   You buy a year's worth of VPN service, the hardware is for free.
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:26.780]   And it is really clever.
[01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:28.980]   And if you have read up lately--
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:31.620]   I mentioned an article a couple of weeks ago about the dangers
[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:33.220]   of public Wi-Fi.
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:35.860]   If you've read up recently on this,
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:38.220]   you realize that just by being in a Wi-Fi access
[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:42.100]   part with a Wi-Fi turned on, you really expose yourself.
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:43.860]   This thing is fantastic.
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:46.940]   So the deal on this is-- and at first,
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:48.900]   you have to configure it with the ethernet.
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.740]   It does everything.
[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:56.300]   It can do hotel ethernet in to your laptop ethernet.
[01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:59.460]   It can do hotel ethernet to a Wi-Fi access point that
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:01.340]   can do four devices.
[02:00:01.340 --> 02:00:06.980]   It can do Wi-Fi in its Starbucks to Wi-Fi out to four devices.
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:08.820]   It acts as a firewall, but it also
[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:12.300]   has built-in VPN from the hotspot VPN.
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:14.780]   So immediately, you can turn it on in the interface.
[02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:16.420]   And immediately, you're in a VPN.
[02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:18.460]   It also has Tor built-in.
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:21.860]   So if you want to be both secure and private,
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:22.780]   you turn on Tor.
[02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:26.660]   It handles it all automatically in hardware.
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:28.380]   It is extremely flexible.
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:33.100]   And I have just fallen in love with this thing.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.460]   I'm not going to do a full review of it.
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:37.260]   I will do a full review on security now.
[02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:39.260]   And I'll show you how to set it up and everything.
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:42.020]   Or maybe on the new screensavers on Saturday.
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:43.860]   But you've got to check this out--
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:47.020]   tinyhardwarefirewall.com.
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:50.300]   If you use open Wi-Fi access points,
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:55.180]   absolutely worth at least considering this thing doesn't
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:57.500]   need a battery or doesn't have a battery,
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:02.820]   it just runs off the USB power from your laptop.
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.300]   I made it always wireless because I
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:07.100]   don't have any laptops with ethernet.
[02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:08.660]   So basically, what happens--
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:09.500]   I can even show you.
[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:11.180]   It's kind of cool.
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:16.020]   I'll plug it into the port on my laptop.
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:19.740]   And now it's powering up from the juice there.
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:21.580]   It takes a couple of minutes to power up.
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:24.660]   But once it does, you'll see its access point.
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:28.380]   It generates, by the way, auto generates new access point name
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:29.060]   and password.
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:30.540]   So everyone's unique.
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:35.660]   You'll see it as an access point, which you can then log into.
[02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:38.660]   And then you surf to the little web browser in the thing,
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:40.300]   and you can configure it.
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:43.100]   You can use it to get onto the open Wi-Fi access point
[02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:47.140]   and all of that, turn on Tor, turn on VPN, turn it off.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:48.500]   It is simple.
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:50.620]   And you carry this around.
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:54.660]   And from now on, you never will be at risk
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:56.740]   at an open Wi-Fi access spot.
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:59.140]   It is a great way to do VPN where
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:02.660]   you don't have to do any software on your computer at all.
[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:04.220]   Computers just thinks it's surfing.
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:07.020]   Oh, it also has malware and adware blocking through a proxy
[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:10.540]   if you want to use it as a-- for that as well.
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:13.420]   That's also optional.
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:20.340]   Firewall.com, the hardware is free if you pay for the VPN
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:22.180]   service, which I think is--
[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:23.940]   let me on get to the exact price.
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:27.620]   It's like $91 or something like that.
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:29.260]   And they do have battery powered devices.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:32.140]   This would actually run off of $91.25.
[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:38.460]   This would actually run off of one of those battery units.
[02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:41.380]   And you could keep it in your MERS and just have it.
[02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:43.020]   And then just log into it.
[02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:45.780]   And you have the little access point in your MERS.
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:46.260]   Nice.
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:48.100]   Or for you ladies, your purse.
[02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:48.940]   You're owning it.
[02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:49.500]   You're owning it.
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:53.820]   I am owning my handbag.
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:54.340]   OK.
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:58.100]   I love it.
[02:02:58.100 --> 02:02:59.500]   It's a nice bag.
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:00.460]   I carry that bag.
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:01.140]   Yeah.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.620]   It's very-- it's horsey.
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:05.100]   I'm from the horsey set.
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.020]   It's not bad.
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:08.540]   It's very Indiana Jones.
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.180]   You know what happened?
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:12.340]   I got shooting pains all up and down my leg.
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:13.820]   I got a little sciatic.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:15.380]   For the longest time, and I finally
[02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:18.140]   realized I had this massive keychain in my pocket.
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:20.020]   And it was causing it.
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:22.540]   So I just started carrying my keys in a MERS.
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:23.420]   Whoa.
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:23.900]   Huh.
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:26.900]   And then when you have a MERS, you have more room for things
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:29.300]   like your little firewall.
[02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:31.020]   I've got tampax in here.
[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:32.020]   All this stuff.
[02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:33.140]   No, I don't.
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:34.820]   Well, actually, you'd be a good idea to carry that one.
[02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:35.500]   That ain't right.
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:36.300]   That ain't right.
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:38.020]   That ain't right.
[02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:40.100]   Gina Trappani, I love seeing you.
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:42.140]   You've got to come back more.
[02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:42.660]   I will.
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:42.940]   I will.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:43.540]   There's a lot of fun.
[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:44.500]   It's really good to see you.
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:45.140]   Yeah.
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:46.460]   Happy New Year to you.
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:49.140]   You find Gina in several places, of course,
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:50.660]   on the internet.
[02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:51.980]   She's on Twitter.
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:52.740]   Gina Trappani.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:55.340]   She's also on Google+, but really, her businesses
[02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:55.660]   are great.
[02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:59.260]   Think up, which everybody should be a subscriber to.
[02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:02.540]   And Make Her Base, which is free, makeherbase.co.
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:03.260]   Yes.

[02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:24.220]   Take care.
