[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.000]   Some people say it's actually gonna be good for Twitter. Speaking of smoke. They're banning jewel
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.680]   But why can't the FDA ban cigarettes? Isn't that the real disaster and then it's time for Twink coin the first

[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.200]   Googles Tasty's got the week off
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.080]   Aunt Pruitt is here from hands-on photography and community manager of the fabulous club to it. Hello aunt
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.040]   So how you be miss I be fine. I'm very well indeed
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.680]   How are you I saw you earlier?
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.640]   Unbelievable as always it was pizza day at the at the East Side Studios and saw you earlier enjoying right
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.600]   Yeah, I was I literally was burping during it went this week. It's kind of embarrassing
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.080]   Also here wait a minute. I've got a card now that lists all his fine attributes ladies and Joe boy
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.200]   Jeff Jarvis, he's the Leonard top professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.160]   Journalism at the City University of New York
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.680]   It's all more elegant now. It's with the new logo. I know I know it's elegant. It's a good word for it
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.520]   They've even laminated the your introduction card. So that I guess you're gonna be around for a while
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.040]   Well, try to get rid of a bad penny man bad penny
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.720]   We thought we should bring in some legal counsel on this day of all days
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.880]   Actually, there's not a day goes by that twig couldn't use legal counsel Kathy. Gellis is here
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.840]   CG counsel calm in beautiful, New Jersey. Hello, Kathy. Thanks for having me someday. I hope to have a card
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.000]   That can be arranged that can be arranged although I've arrived
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.240]   When I when my credentials can be laminated. I know it's the real deal man
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.880]   that's the real deal Kathy's also a contributor at tech dirt and
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.600]   Read the entire 241 page
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.640]   filing from
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.280]   Twitter's attorneys
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.720]   At the chanceery of the state of Delaware
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.760]   Did you read it all next to 62 pages? It's not that's you could you could do that in the morning?
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.280]   I did some preparation for today. I have not read every word, but I read the
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.600]   most of the filing most of I think I read all of there's a motion to expedite that came out today and
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.560]   Then I was going back to the original agreement and I looked over a couple of the terms of the agreement
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.680]   Oh, you did your own work. I did I even was I know well
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.600]   This is so annoying was last time I complained that you made me remember corporate law
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.240]   So even when I looked for my corporate law, I know I could not find but
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.720]   Sensible things to say on the subject because somehow I thought you might ask me a few things so not too many
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.920]   We're not gonna make it so what do you think Kathy? What do you think? All right?
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.120]   Well, let me actually let me give you a less open-ended question because that's that could that could be a lot of things
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.880]   Maybe start at the at the 30,000 foot level Twitter is
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.000]   suing Musk
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.600]   Saying you said you're gonna give us 44 billion and by God we want the 44 billion
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.400]   They're suing in Delaware because that's where Twitter is incorporated. It's in the chance to record
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.520]   Which I've been told in court some of the actions like this moves quickly. What is what is the timeframe you think for this?
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.760]   kind of a lawsuit I
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.080]   Don't know but the motion for exped to expedite was
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.120]   There's supposed to be a drop dead date built into the merger agreement itself
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.760]   Which was like October 24th of this year? So the idea with the motion to expedite is that?
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.120]   There'll be about two months of pre trial
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.040]   So whatever discovery would happen enough time for a trial and enough time for an appeal for there to be a final resolution
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.640]   That would happen before October 24th. So that sort of thing is apparently not unprecedented
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.000]   Expedite it it's fast on by general terms even without the expert
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.200]   I've heard people say oh, it's gonna be ten years before this is resolved. No, it's not a decade long action
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.000]   No, I went through this with time Warner and and paramount because there was a fight over that just as we were
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.440]   Starting at a table weekly and it was a couple weeks
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.800]   Delaware is very corporate friendly - that's why you
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.080]   It's not really a regular court. I don't think the chance to record is
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:55.040]   Every so often you hit things that sort of have courts with unusual jurisdiction and the terms of that jurisdiction tend to be net very narrow
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.600]   But by being very narrow they can be very efficient
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.360]   So we're not talking a normal federal civil litigation trial, which has its own timeline for how long it would take
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.200]   This is something that speaks to Delaware law specifically
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.920]   corporate law specifically and the chance records being the courts of jurisdiction to to work this out and so they've seen this before
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.960]   Delaware has laws built in order to
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.720]   Companies like going there because it can be so efficient from the corporate law front and so they got systems
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.080]   But this is kind of people have reflexes from general standard federal civil litigation and those instincts don't really apply here
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.480]   Both in terms of the process and also I think in terms of the substance
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.360]   We're even though this is a breach of contract claim and you see those in federal court
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   This is an unusual and very specific type of picture contract claim. Yeah, and
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.560]   It's one that features for instance a variety of tweets in a mojo
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.840]   involved well, I meant in terms of normal things
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.040]   The one thing that will be interesting is well the one thing that's probably a lot that's interesting about this
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.080]   But it also has a some characteristics that are unusual for the chance to record to be dealing with so
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.200]   I don't know if they've ever adjudicated a poop emoji before but now they will first
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.600]   appropriate since world emoji day is Friday I
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.480]   Guess there are I'm not sure what Twitter wants to gain from this
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.320]   It's because the money isn't coming out of Elon Musk's ample pockets
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.640]   But as involves a number of other investors
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.400]   I don't know if they really intend to get all 44 billion they may and but they want more than one day
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.800]   They want more than the one billion breakup fee the reserve it important
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.400]   Paragraph I think in paragraph four of the of the nature of the action
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.760]   That price presented by must gonna take it or leave it basis in an unsolicited public offer
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.880]   represented a 38% premium over Twitter's unaffected share price
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:01.120]   unaffected at the moment soon soon to be affected the other terms Musk offered and agreed to were he touted seller friendly
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.800]   There is no financing contingency and no diligence condition
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.000]   The deal is backed by airtight debt and equity commitments
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:17.280]   Musk has personally committed 33.5 billion. I think that 33.5 billion is an important number. I suspect that's
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.360]   Maybe the number they think they can get out of out of musk although he wouldn't then own the company
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.280]   He would I don't know what that I it's very complicated because in order to buy the company
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:35.160]   He has to get 50 has to have a proxy vote with the shareholders gets 51% of the proxy vote and then all the shareholders
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:41.960]   Have to get $54.20 per share which is a total and he's already said he doesn't want it and he said he doesn't want it and
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:49.480]   Presumably the sovereign wealth front of South Saudi Arabia and Larry Ellison and the others who put up money Larry put up a billion himself
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.760]   They are they gonna be actually that's a question for you Kathy. Are they bound by what the chanceary?
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.200]   Court of chanceary says
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.920]   Actually, I don't know the answer to that. I'm not sure they be bound specifically because I think they're
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:12.400]   Right contracts are with Musk and chances are he might be in breach of their contracts to them where they could basically pull their money
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.160]   Like he he might end up
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.960]   I don't think I'm speaking out of school on this but I could be wrong like all of this is a I'm not a corporate lawyer and B
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.240]   Law is not very stable these days and see this is really pushing the edges of it
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.400]   but one outcome is he could potentially be on the hook for
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   If he could even can't do the purchase but some form of damages that comes close to the purchase price and not really have a way to
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.640]   finance it and one question is then what
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.680]   You know, he may have a judgment against him. It may be and what does he do if he's got this judge
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:49.120]   What happens to Twitter if Twitter wins the money has an award against him? What money can I actually extract from him?
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.080]   This is gonna be I mean the problem with the last
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:01.060]   Five six years in law is that we've been stress testing every single aspect of constitutional law corporate law contract law
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.520]   tort law everything has been going against the outer boundaries of how these laws supposed to function and
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:12.440]   When you go to that and you push the edges you find out to what extent it actually can function while at the edges
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.160]   This isn't supposed to happen
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:21.480]   This isn't supposed to be a kind of thing that's supposed to happen and Twitter's complaint really kind of puts together why it's not supposed to happen
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:28.440]   You're not supposed to have a purchaser walk in make an offer and then essentially vandalize the company and then walk away from the deal
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:35.120]   Yeah, so they say much much as its strategy is a model of hypocrisy a model of bad faith
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.720]   The claims are pretext and lack any merit
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:45.000]   This is I've said this before we're in a situation. We have been for five years
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.440]   all of everything everything in this country the rule of law is to is kind of
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:56.360]   Assuming a certain amount of normal behavior and when people are willing to go beyond the norms
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.120]   We often don't have the question is do we enforce?
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.560]   The law in this case and the norms though you're right those are two different things
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.960]   But but there is precedent here there are things to call upon I put up a really good thread from Morgan Ricks
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.200]   about the remedies involved a Vanderbilt law professor and
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.640]   And I'll just read to them. It's very daunting to order specific performance in a situation like this
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.560]   There's external financing that has to be made to perform which is what you just talked about and if bus flouts your what if
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.120]   Bus clouds your order turns to do a showdown over the courts jurisdiction and power which is what you're saying Leo
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.120]   Is that when you don't follow all the rules?
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.480]   If you just walk away, what is it? What are the chance or he's gonna come after you?
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:47.160]   Well, there's chance or there's also don't forget SEC, right? Because he's who has by the way up to now been kind of
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.240]   Lane you with mr. Musk's let's shall we say?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.480]   He's in trouble with the SEC is gonna happen to him
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.920]   I mean if they force it that's irrespective of what happens with this case exactly
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.560]   But the issue is like that's part of normally specific performance over a human being as a remedy for contracts is disfavored
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.160]   Because there's a 13th amendment problem with forcing another human being to do something they don't want to do
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.560]   this is a little unusual because he's sort of a human being and sort of incorporate form and
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.360]   It's not quite clear. Can you you can sometimes get specific performance out of like an enterprise? Yes
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.760]   come into a
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.520]   Close your deal. You have no choice. You can't walk away. It's been happened and they're so exciting at Tyson foods merger from
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.640]   Sometime in this millennium as as an example of one where it would happen
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.720]   But it's tricky under the best of circumstances and this is really sort of the outer edge of this is not normal
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.240]   This is a human being who happened to have a billion dollars to throw around so it's very strange
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.320]   Rick's thinks that that that there owed a billion for the rake-up fee
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.520]   Which I certainly would agree with and a billion in monetary damages now
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.880]   Where do you come with a billion for that?
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.200]   But I think you're talking that everybody's talking about that Twitter is so bad off Twitter can get rid of
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.240]   Musk and I think we'll get a few more billion cash in the bank
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.160]   Now if they have a different board and different management, there's a different question. What do they do with it?
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.960]   But I think Twitter could end up in the long run
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.360]   Hurt for now, but if they can get rid of Musk and get some money
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:23.160]   So that's the that's the point of that's what I have some of these lawsuits and everything
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.000]   It's weird because I've also said Twitter should just walk away and say fine
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.760]   And what a number of people complained about if who's the founder of Twitter
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:38.440]   Ev's tweet was that ignores the damage that Elon has done to shareholders
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.800]   There is beyond the hurt to do sheary duty to shareholders here
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.760]   There is a I mean look at the current stock price for Twitter. I mean there this was damaging this looks
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.640]   You know like almost like a pump and dump scheme that went wrong
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:59.440]   We are wrong and who gets damaged in a pump and dump scheme is the everyday investors
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.520]   So there so it's easy for Ev you know billionaire to billionaire to say I'll let Elon off the hook
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.440]   But there are a lot of Twitter investors who are left holding the bag
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.760]   And that's what the answer a court cares about right
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.240]   All about shareholder protection
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.320]   I mean possibly at the expense of other things would be good for a lot of care about but that's what
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.760]   Delaware corporate law optimizes for protection of shareholders particularly of minority shareholders
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.960]   And so that's what it's adjudication in this forum is going to be keyed towards and yeah
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.200]   There's been damage
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   I mean I use the word vandalized Twitter didn't use that word
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.520]   But they basically make the same point of you came you offered you kind of made it that we couldn't say no
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:46.880]   And then we said yes to let you go ahead and close this deal and you immediately disparaged us like and here's your poop emoji
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.600]   In violation of their agreement they had an
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.840]   Yes, yes, you were saying that he did Twitter deserves more than the one billion dollar clause
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:06.580]   That was there is it only because of his poor behavior or if he hadn't done any of these stupid tweets and poop emoji things
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:12.040]   In this side did you know what I don't I don't want to do this are you saying okay now?
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.880]   They only deserve the one billion dollars that happens all the time people back out of agreements all the time
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.040]   So I this is this is the answer that I prepared in advance because I
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.360]   Yes, although all the caveats not a corporate lawyer
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.760]   This is weird. This is outside the jurisdiction, but one basic point to point out is
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.000]   down
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   I think normal Americans viewed
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.840]   Damage as you win in a in a lawsuit as sort of like almost a prize of like whoo-hoo
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.160]   We got a million dollars of the settlement or something like that
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.880]   And that's not how damages are supposed to work the idea of damages is that it's supposed in most cases
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.780]   It's supposed to make you whole particularly in a contract case that the idea of damages is that the parties
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.320]   Had thought they were okay
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.360]   They thought they were gonna have this deal and the deal fell apart
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.440]   So the point of the damages is to make them as okay as they would have been if the deal had closed
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.840]   So the idea with the billion dollar debt of fee that they wrote in is that okay?
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:14.720]   If this deal falls apart and I think the one billion dollars that clause maybe could have been better written
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.320]   But I think the point of is is the deal fails for a couple of reasons
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.280]   We can't anticipate will be hurt
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:26.400]   But we think that the hurt can be measured by a billion dollars and you if you pay it will be whole and then go about your lives
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:33.800]   The issue is that must did more and the reason is getting breached is not necessarily one of those terms that in it was anticipated
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.600]   But other terms beyond that and also he caused additional harm
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:44.000]   So I think what that's happening with this complaint is that's being queued up to try to get something more to recognize
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   The huge hurt to Twitter
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.120]   Some people and I don't think that billion dollars will necessarily function as a cap because I think it was based on
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.360]   If you walk away from a number of these circumstances we can anticipate
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.520]   This is the measure of damages, but that Twitter is now arguing
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.800]   This is something that nobody would have ever anticipated because we would have anticipated that you'd act in good faith
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.120]   And because you acted in this way instead
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.360]   Nobody couldn't for that you're acting in good faith
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.400]   And we you know we can't clean up the mess that you've made for us just because you've walked away now
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   So I think they're trying to do that
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.120]   So if you look at the market cap right now, sorry, sorry you go ahead. I'm sorry
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:27.360]   I don't claim to know the law like anybody else would that's not a lawyer
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.960]   But does defamation come in here? Is anything
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:37.200]   Around that part of this consideration for his bad acting
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.640]   Or is it just
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:46.400]   My so I think the thing is that the jurisdiction on the claims may be limited
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.600]   But I'm speaking a little bit outside my zone here
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:55.320]   But this is not a blank slate for other types of claims that they might have against Elon Musk
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.920]   Including under California law like unfair business practices
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.920]   So they could make that too?
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.520]   Not sure they could go nowhere
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.240]   No, not chance rate, but they could whatever they went in chance rate
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.160]   They could still go to answer question. Could they go to another court on another action?
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.040]   I don't know
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.280]   Or the settlement here would be here's your money that ends it
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.720]   I don't know
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   I mean basically one of the things that like you're trained up in law school is you play the hand your dealt
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.600]   But sometimes there's certain ways that things are set up where it's like no
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.400]   That's much more of a Hail Mary than you thought and I don't know the answer to the question of how many bites at the apple
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.640]   And how many courts they could get but if they found that they needed more bites
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   They would certainly try to get
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.320]   But I don't know if they can and right now
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:43.240]   You've got a live contract where there's been a breach and the and right now the chance record is the one to adjudicate the breach
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.720]   And when you caught when they look at what broke and the hurt that happened
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.880]   They're looking for a measure of damages now
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:57.400]   I think one of the reasons they're asking for specific performance is that share price is a way of starting to come up with a number
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.880]   So if it's not gonna be forcing him to purchase at that number then it might out
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.160]   Translate into some other form of money and that's gonna turn into multiples of billions. I believe it's the current
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.280]   So Kathy to answer that a current market cap was 28 billion the offer was 44 billion. So right there is
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.200]   16 billion as a starting point now, I'm probably not gonna end up there
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.520]   You could argue that the 44 billion was not the high end
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.200]   It was what the stock was at the time but that's still a lot more than 28 billion
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.720]   So the Leo's point the damage to the shareholders is
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.560]   Considerable and measurable and then go to answer point. There's also damage to reputation
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.000]   They've lost management there's in people there are all kinds of other things too
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.920]   People are leaving because of the speculation of him being the new ownership. Yeah
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.480]   So I wouldn't frame it as defamation partly because
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:54.080]   Defamation is very narrow in the United States and corporate defamation is even more narrow than that
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:01.200]   But there is definitely an issue of disparagement which they bring up in the complaint because he was obligated not to disparage the company
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.800]   And he did and in theory the deal could still close even though he did
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.520]   But then he walked away he disparaged and then walked away
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.960]   so now they're like
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.120]   You know, these are the things of the true measure of damages. No, not necessarily the the billion they had pre negotiated because
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:21.520]   They knew how much harm he could potentially cause if they walked away, but they hadn't anticipated how much harm he could cause
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:29.360]   If he also breached the non disparagement cause so somehow they would probably want to collect the money that would count that damage and remediate it
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.680]   I don't know if this is the vehicle for it
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:38.720]   But they're swinging for the fences as far as this vehicle is concerned to try to get a number that's high enough and realistically if they got a number that's high enough
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.800]   All right
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.320]   Let's do a pool
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.160]   if
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.400]   Let's presume that twitter wins and musk gets away must cast a paying amount
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.960]   It may come out of chance rate may come out of a settlement
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.560]   What number do you think might be each of you?
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.200]   Well, I should I should point out and you brought this up, Kathy that the precedent for this
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.000]   Is that earlier tyson foods case where uh, they tried to back out of a purchase of the iowa
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.640]   pork producers ibp
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.480]   Uh, this is in 2003 and the chance rate court said no you can't back out you've got to buy them
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.920]   Uh, and uh, uh, it's not exactly analogous. I hope that doesn't happen here
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.720]   Well, it's not exactly analogous, but it's
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.040]   Similar and by the way tyson did a lot of damage in the process
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.640]   You know chasing off other bitters like smithfield who also wanted them
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.680]   So, uh, ibp had a pretty good cause
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.720]   In this case to say hey, you know, you you really damaged us and they were tyson was forced to buy him
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.800]   Uh
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:47.120]   So that is I think that's what twitter is saying is this is like tyson there there isn't a material adverse effect
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.480]   Elon remember elan publicly has said
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.760]   The problem is the five that the twitter's figure of five percent spam bots is way low
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.280]   That's not what he what his lawyers scaddon arps said in their
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.280]   Complaint against twitter in their and their request to back out of the deal. They said that twitter was non cooperative
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.600]   Uh and twitter saying what do you mean non cooperative a we were said b
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:16.720]   We didn't have to be we were more cooperative than we even had to be because this was a no-doo diligence deal
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.120]   Yes, so uh, they gave him a whole bunch of didn't they give him the fire hose?
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.080]   They are all sorts of energy needed any long claim. It was rate limited and that was a problem
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.960]   There were claims and they raised the late the rate I think to something that was like completely unprecedented
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.120]   I'm going to quote, uh, Andrew Torres from the opening arguments pockets. They did three whole episodes in this
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.600]   Which was quite good and quite interesting going back to the origin of it
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.960]   but uh
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.000]   Andrew who and this is kind of in his uh in his bailiwick
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.240]   um
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.760]   he uh
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:55.520]   He did talk about the Tyson case. That's how I know about it. Uh, um, he he pointed out that
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.120]   uh
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.040]   It probably that the court may decide and should probably decide
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:06.480]   That because twitter did not have to give elana anything
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:14.240]   It's re it was reasonable not to give him anything because the fear would be that elan would then use that information
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.880]   against twitter or tweet it
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.120]   That it was in effect if this is the analogy they used if you
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.840]   bought a house as is
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:29.040]   And then a day before closing said to the seller. Oh, and I want to inspect the roof
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.280]   The seller would be within their rights to say no
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.320]   Yep, because you said a you were going to buy it as is you you waive that right
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.920]   But furthermore that gives you ammunition if you go inspect the roof and you find something or you damage the roof
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.240]   It's only to the seller's disadvantage to give you that information
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.920]   So the fact that twitter cooperated at all. I think their lawyers are going to make the case
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.200]   We went above and beyond our requirements. We were not required to put to give them anything
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:04.880]   But just behavior at this point reads like okay, either it reads that they were really really really desperate to close it
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.480]   That's what it looks like, right?
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:13.680]   Because it also reads as they were they knew this day would come and they wanted to make sure that when this lawsuit got filed
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.760]   They were in the best position possible
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.600]   Yeah, it would be there within the rights to say no, but then you have to litigate it
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.280]   And the fact that they gave him everything they went above and beyond to give him stuff
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:28.560]   His ability to say no, I didn't know enough is you know, they're pulling the the air out of that
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.240]   I just all negotiation. Yeah, but I have to say
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.400]   We really come to a point in this country where
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.680]   These trollish billionaires seem like they can get away with anything and do anything they want
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.320]   And it really may be it's time to say no, no, you have legal obligations. You have to fulfill
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.520]   I don't I think every Williams is completely wrong
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.080]   You know his tweet was
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:57.440]   I'm you know if I were on the board. I'd be asking if we could just let this whole ugly episode blow over
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:06.480]   Uh, no, you can't he's really injured the company. Well, I don't you find it very interesting and I I'm trying not to be conspiracy-minded here
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.800]   But both evanjack
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.440]   Both were very pro elon here
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.920]   And I I feel like this somebody said it's maybe it's the case
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:23.200]   That that explains why jack left abruptly put in agro wall arguably not a great choice for ceo at twitter
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.840]   Because he anticipated this
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.080]   And he wanted this to happen he wanted twitter to be sold to elon
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.880]   And that's why he was pushing this all along
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.280]   Here's the only real question to me. It's pretty apparent to me
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.760]   That elon's in the wrong twitter's got a very strong case here
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:49.680]   They should win but kathy what happens if they do win the court says no elon you have to buy it and he says yeah, but I all of this is
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.000]   Contingent on loans from a bunch of other third parties
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.680]   Can he be forced to somehow fulfill that?
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:05.040]   I don't know. I think the play here is to and to possibly everyone satisfaction the question is what the dollar amount is is that
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.840]   It in lieu of the specific performance what would be the damage that would be calculated
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.640]   Some of that should go to the shareholders, right?
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.360]   potentially
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:21.360]   I mean, yeah, and this is so annoying because it's pressing
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.280]   There's it's a lot of legal pieces in motion to which there's answers
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.080]   But a lot of us who don't practice this every day don't know there's an answer over here and an answer over here
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.960]   So there's a lot of threads of what happens. What do they do get a money judgment from him in some way?
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.080]   How do you enforce it against what do you enforce it like?
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:45.360]   This is a very geeky moment at time, but it's also really annoying to show up as a legal expert on a show and and not have all the answers because
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.480]   There's a lot of interesting questions out there. So, um, we love your humility
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:56.960]   I'm times like this. It's so glad I went to law school, but um, uh, uh,
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.600]   There's sounds like this. I'm so glad I didn't
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:06.320]   Yeah, I don't know. I wish it gave me more x-ray vision. Um, and it's kind of you know, it's exciting to see him play out
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:11.520]   Except I'm upset about this. This is not a company. I don't care about this is not people. I don't care about
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.440]   Yes, I I really liked what jeff said and I am inclined to agree. I think the best outcome for twitter is
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.640]   Get this get this out of the way extract as much cash as you can
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.280]   Which I think really should be more than at least a single billion, but I don't know how many other billions
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:34.960]   It should be for a just result somehow inject that into the company get rid of its current board and get good people who believe in the company
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.600]   Back on board who can retain the talent and go forth and be a really innovative
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.240]   And civically minded company that it's been. I mean
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.600]   Twitter has been a really good neighbor
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:51.520]   In the areas of law that I care about and free speech and free speech protection. They stand up for their users
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.040]   They push back against abusive subpoenas. They're pushing back against
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.640]   Sensorial behavior in india like this company has been a really good neighbor
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:07.200]   And I want them to succeed and I think we're all kind of screwed if they don't so this there's a certain bit where there's like some interesting
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   Shaded for let's get the popcorn
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:14.320]   Except I care too much about this company and what happens and this really interesting medium that they've developed
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:21.520]   Um, so I want the result and I'm rooting for the result and it's contorting my legal analysis to get the result that I think would be best
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.080]   Um, but as a lawyer, I'm also an advocate. So what do I need to push on to to get that?
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:33.040]   Um, I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility that twitter can win twitter can win with money twitter can win with an award of money
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.040]   That's somehow they can enforce and then they can go on with their lives. However, that's a real
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.960]   That's a bunch of really small
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.840]   Eyes of needles that they need to thread an awful lot through and the only thing that makes the popcorn eating
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:49.040]   A little bit more palatable is this will start to happen more quickly than a normal simple trial would
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.240]   Um, if the x if the motion to expedite is granted
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.920]   Hot off the presses a colleague said they recently turned down one motion to expedite
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.800]   But that may have been because it was at the beginning of the pandemic. So can't quite read the tea leaves there
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.200]   The motion for the different case a different it was a different case and this one
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:13.760]   You know reading their motion was compelling now. Also all of this analysis needs to put a giant asterisk of
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:21.760]   Um, we have not seen what musk would like to defend himself with and he gets to and scat and arps is not a bunch of stupid lawyers
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.600]   Like they they know how to write a pleading. So something will come and um, we can see what defense day he he
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.440]   He provides
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.920]   Uh, which you know, and then we can go analyze this again
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:37.360]   But people are wondering because so much of this has happened in public like what could he possibly say to defend his?
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.600]   You know what he's done here and um
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.680]   The only bad thing about all this is we're gonna hear a lot more you on musk twitter
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   News over the last next year
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.080]   Unfortunately, it was hoping we were done on 30
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.880]   So let me let's move on from that to say
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.280]   Can I ask a talk about can I ask question first?
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.960]   Yes, you know, I know it's not a democracy. Can I ask question first? Yeah, go ahead
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.160]   Oh, he looks so sad. He's gonna ask you questions
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.760]   I would I would like to hear his cat he started on this path. I'd like to hear
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.960]   If you if you're the new chairman of the board and the new board member of twitter new ceo twitter
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   What do you do now? Do you look for a purchaser? That's question one question two is
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.480]   Whoever does a deal with y'all on musk again in life. What happens to him in business?
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.160]   Um, I don't think twitter would have talked to him
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:30.880]   They knew exactly what was coming up because he'd already gotten in trouble with the sec for pretending that he was going to take
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.040]   Tesla private twitter knew exactly who they were dealing with
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.320]   I don't think they wanted to do this, but what choice did they have?
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:45.120]   It's tricky. I mean a key term that I've not used yet, but it's really important for all this analysis
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:52.240]   This is the idea of fiduciary duties and who has them and to whom do they have them and that there's fiduciary duties to the companies to the shareholders
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:58.960]   Alon musk arguably had some fiduciary duties during the dependency of this duty and of this uh transaction
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:06.240]   And one of the arguments that um that they made in the pleading is that he basically breached it because he wasn't giving consent
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.200]   So they could do the things that it would take to to retain the talent
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.880]   um
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.800]   That's a big thing that you have to follow with
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:20.960]   You know did the people currently in power do what they should have been doing as to protect them the company to protect the other shareholders
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.920]   And the answer is they may have been between a rock and a hard place and they did what you know a reasonable thing
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.600]   Um, but you might want other initially they adopted a poison pill. They said they were going to adopt a poison pill
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.160]   They yeah, they tried to and then they just finally for some reason just threw up their hands and said well
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.560]   No one else is going to buy us. Maybe he's not completely full of you know what?
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.040]   But i'm just gonna get a question. I'm just offering you yeah
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.120]   Go ahead. Well if somebody's offering you a lot of money more than you know
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.920]   Somebody offers to buy your house for more than a third
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:59.200]   How do you it's a tricky thing to then say no to that and there's a question of whether you're actually within your fiduciary duties to say no to that
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.000]   Um, that's tricky because the problem is is you will free money
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.800]   You know that you should say yes except it was free money with this huge anchor around it where
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.920]   Free money unless you lose the entire company in the process of pursuing it in which case
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.520]   And maybe there was enough writing on the wall that they really should have said this is not free
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.680]   This is like too good to be true and we cannot possibly say yes to it because it's going to break the company if we if we try to do this
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.000]   But um, I don't know, you know hindsight 2020, etc, but um
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:33.680]   I don't know, you know, the problem is is the company is capitalized in a not particularly strong position
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.480]   And getting it to a position where it is strong and can't just be swallowed up by somebody else
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:43.840]   Who has the cash in hand? It doesn't really care about the company. Uh, that's a thing that could happen
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.240]   Um, although that's what i'm ready to ask here is let's say let's say you've got
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.600]   Three billion more dollars you're rid of musk
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.640]   What's the strategy for twitter going forward?
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.200]   Measure or past chance we know we're past all of this. I mean, I think some of it is
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:07.040]   What is its business plan and what is its path to profitability and what is its monetization plan and how do you take what's what works best about twitter and
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.520]   Expanded and expanded in a complete in a increasingly hostile regulatory environment
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.480]   This is a tough company to drive
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:20.240]   But it's also incredibly exciting about what it can do and if it's got the runway to succeed
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.480]   It is this tricky. Um, it's a public company. So it's got different things holding it back and different duties and obligations
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:32.080]   It's regulated in different ways, but on the other hand some of that regulation should have protected twitter much better than it has so far
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.960]   I say you see sweet
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:41.680]   I don't necessarily have a problem with um, you know as an engineer being ceo
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:48.640]   I kind of like that the problem is is the moment in time was it really needed somebody who might have had more of a corporate
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:54.160]   Savvy to navigate this but in terms of rebuilding twitter, he might actually be the guy
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.080]   Let's face it. It's the board is the issue here. The board by the way does not have a lot of
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:04.560]   Dog in this hunt. They're not big shareholders as musk has pointed out. So their fiduciary responsibility is to the shareholders
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:11.280]   And have an oven jack are off the board. Yeah, it's interesting that evan jack both have big opinions about this
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.400]   um, I think I would I would say
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:22.480]   The issue really was it's do or die for twitter that this is this guy ultimately is the white knight
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.320]   They needed because
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.720]   No one else would buy it. It's been on for sale for a long time. Nobody else could buy it
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:35.760]   He was a wolf at sweet and she was clothing and that's the problem. They knew that oh the sheep's clothing was uh, thread bearer
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:42.720]   Yeah, they knew it and they and I think that they said this is our last shot guys. That's clearly what jack dorsey thought
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.000]   and uh, this is we you know take it or leave it and um
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.080]   I don't know what he won was thinking whether he ever really wanted it
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:57.600]   It's my I don't think I don't think he understood what was valuable about it
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.920]   I mean he rails at things that are actually good about it
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:04.240]   And he he doesn't seem to understand a lot of the issues including the things he doesn't like about it
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.280]   Like he really doesn't have a lot of understanding about what the business was he was trying to buy his way into
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.600]   Well, and there's a cost to twitter because it's I mean they've lost staff
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:20.560]   In fact, uh, I have a story here somewhere that uh, the twitter's twitter is completely demoralized by this
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:25.440]   Yes, they also fired to with what I don't understand is is kavon
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.720]   Um pretty good last name was that we had a product is is brilliant and they fired him
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.480]   And I'm not sure why they fired two top executives. I don't get fat
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.720]   And that's one of us argument by the way was oh you're turning the company apart before I buy it
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.640]   You've you've fired key employee at this point. He's just throwing everything against the
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.800]   Of course, yes, but that's that
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.240]   That has a little bit more attraction than most of the things he wants to say I don't think the bot thing has traction
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.640]   I don't think they're not giving him information as traction that I think is a defensible thing
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.200]   you know managing the human resources, but
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.560]   Insufficient
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:06.320]   Immaterial adverse that's by the way, that's the the term that you know, they've got to demonstrate
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.520]   That's what happened in tyson versus uh, ibp versus tyson
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:16.880]   It has the the court decided that the the things that had gone on at ibp were not materially adverse
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.320]   And uh as a result the merger agreement had to go through tyson said oh no no
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.560]   There's their prices gone down. There's all sorts of terrible things happening in the courts that no it's not enough
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.320]   Is not i also tend to think that along could have negotiated for more
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.520]   Um like if he wanted to lock things down in place he probably could have asked for more and instead
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.840]   He's sort of negotiated agreement that gave the company latitude to continue to run itself
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:46.960]   And it did continue to run itself and it's not clear that the personnel changes are out of line with the company running itself
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.880]   Um, which typically like you kind of have some discretion to run yourself
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.440]   Um, where have shareholders can't come after you for you ran your you ran the company this way and I object
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.480]   um
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.520]   So I you know, it's it holds water that he could complain about that
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.600]   But I don't necessarily know if it's gonna win the day and a lot of this stuff is like
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.360]   It's not like it's never happened before
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.880]   A lot of these terms were standard and the chance record has seen them before and knows how to adjudicate them
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.200]   And there's some precedent that they can they can turn to
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.720]   What happens to twitter now?
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:23.760]   That's my question. Yeah, that's that's really what we care about right unless you're a shareholder right
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.160]   right
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.720]   I
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.280]   You know twitter's real value has nothing to do with any of this. It's the people opposed to it's us
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.320]   Will we continue to post to twitter? Why wouldn't we?
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:40.720]   Yes, I didn't like the idea of posting to twitter if if elon owned it that felt like a different
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.440]   proposition than what i bargained for but
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:49.280]   People did leave most people just said well, let's see what happens right people leave
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.160]   Yeah, Mike Isaac, uh, I think quit and came back and
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.400]   uh
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.600]   but uh
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.440]   so
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.920]   Honestly, the value of twitter has nothing to do with as long as they can keep the servers running right
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:11.120]   It has nothing to do with the company has everything to do with who's on it and who toasts to it assuming that nothing that happens in all of this
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.080]   brings the servers to their knees
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:19.280]   If it becomes a protocol
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.680]   If you go to the blue sky, I mean you're gonna still tweet jeff. I know you are
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:29.200]   I'm gonna tweet and and I think that if it does become a protocol and you can build things on top of it wordpress like
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.120]   It could be the conversational wordpress. It could it could grow much much bigger
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.400]   If it goes back to even better than an api
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:42.160]   The protocol ability to build things on top of it businesses on top of it. Uh, I think there's ways to make that happen
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.120]   It's not easy. It's not it's not clear and obvious how to do that
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.960]   But I do think there is a different strategy to be had
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:54.240]   Is this are you basically saying I need to reinvent themselves because at the core that's not what twitter was all about
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.120]   I don't think that's a change of thing. They have to keep the servers running
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:04.720]   Just keep the servers up so we can have those really quick bursts of communication with people we care about or twitter is what we say it is
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:10.880]   Twitter is what we say it is aside from features like twitter blue or the edit button none of which really
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.280]   Which is de minimis twitter is what is what it's is is made of people
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:23.280]   Like silent green and if the people still tweet and the people still go there to read it as long as they can keep the servers going
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.240]   Mm-hmm. I mean that may be a question because I don't know how they want it
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.400]   It's more than that though because then you also get into content moderation and things like that
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.480]   So one of the things is whether
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.480]   Twitter is multiple things
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:40.640]   At once all rolled into a company like all the social media companies are both infrastructure and application
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:47.440]   At the same time and one of the things that I think makes sense and twitter is probably further ahead in thinking about this than any of the other
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:55.920]   Companies because of the blue sky is that twitter functioning as essentially almost platform infrastructure for other people to
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.560]   Then deploy for their own communities and their own content and their own distribution of like
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:07.760]   240 character tweets or whatever whatever they had to call where you divorce a little bit the
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:15.520]   Hardware and and saw you know the really embedded infrastructure parts of of what twitter is from the content that sits on top of it
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.680]   That may be inevitable anyway
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.400]   Just because of the regulatory
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.560]   I think that there are to be honest
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.520]   We're gonna take a break a second and unfreeze Kathy
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.920]   But I think there would we have to take a break anyway
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.920]   But I think there are to be honest
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:37.760]   Maybe ways to handle this issue of server and moderation all the expenses of twitter
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.080]   And maybe a better way than a monolithic twitter
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:47.680]   Massing on handles easily handles moderation issues. Maybe there's a way for twitter to self moderate
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:54.400]   Um, you know or choice moderate that I get my twitter you get your yeah, right we have different twitters
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.640]   And I hire I hire aunt how hard is it run my twitter and pay him for that?
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:04.080]   Well, are you just are you just unfollow and block people that you don't like and then your twitter is just what you want it to be
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.440]   I think it's completely doable. So, um, I don't think this might be actually
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.360]   Salutary for twitter in the long run. That's my argument
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.880]   I think this is it was a bad that they got schmuts by him at all
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.520]   Well, I but if they can get rid of him and get some money and um
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.400]   Yeah, he gives him because he gives him
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.200]   He's got 21 billion that he's at a pocket
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.000]   He gives him 21 billion which I could see the court saying well
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:36.000]   We can't force your lenders to give you anything, but you you're 21 billion is good still give him 21 billion
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.800]   And that's enough that's enough to run twitter for a long time. Oh, yeah
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.640]   Five billion ten billion that could be quite good
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:51.280]   That you buy the argument that yahoo made that he that he he did all of this so he could cash out more tesla stock
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:58.080]   That wasn't very that wasn't actually did not come from uh yahoo yahoo had the story and the story. Yeah, but uh,
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.840]   um
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:05.360]   Was it matt levina can't remember but somebody clever said elon hat was at a
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.080]   Point in time where he had to
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:14.320]   Uh sell stock or lose it and he needed a way to do this that had a cover
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.280]   so, um, I thought that was kind of clever. This is um
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.880]   Henry blodgett said this it was Henry said that
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.960]   Logic said this so this is a tweet from Henry blodgett
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:33.360]   He said that musk's ten year tesla options were about to expire so he had to sell them the twitter bid
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.920]   Allowed him to do that without facing questions about why he was selling
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.400]   And incidentally he sold at an excellent price now Henry blodgett's pretty sharp
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.200]   Hmm. He definitely is and he knows the market and he knows the ways of
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.920]   marketeers so
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:56.160]   Maybe maybe that's what happened. He could have done a better job and just walked away with a billion cost for doing that and not with
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:02.480]   Right and 20 billion. I want him to be slapped silly personally. I I but that's completely an emotional
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:07.760]   That's not a legal judgment. Wow. I just I just an emotional job file a friend of the court brief
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.280]   Yeah, well, well my legal analysis is being
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.760]   Tinted by the same sentiment. Yeah, so
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:20.000]   Which is a danger. You know, I want to put up all the asterisks for um, you know, I it does not
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   Feel like justice is getting served if he could just hit and run like this and run away
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:29.280]   I want to I want to feel as a citizen of this planet that law can prevent this sort of thing
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.560]   And I know that law is built to prevent this sort of thing
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.400]   So I'd like to see it actually flex its muscle and do its job and
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:42.560]   Down with this sort of thing and that there's actually a remedy that law can deliver to somebody who got hurt by this sort of behavior
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.680]   There's a real argument that we need that to be because if and this is what the SEC's job
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:54.960]   by the way is to preserve faith in the markets and and the number one job of the SEC is to
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:02.640]   Make sure that any investor feels like they have all the information that any other investor has so that they can make an intelligent decision
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:10.560]   To buying a stock investors will abandon the stock market if they feel like it's it's rigged and there's an inside
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.960]   You know, uh group of people that knows what's going on. That's the SEC's entire
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:21.440]   Point of it for its existence because otherwise the markets don't work. You have to feel like it's a fair market
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:27.920]   This is the kind of thing that makes people say that's it. I'm not I'm not buying stock anymore
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.840]   So it's really important that this this be solved
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:38.640]   And that people be made whole and that this kind of behavior is sanctioned in such a way that it doesn't keep happening
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.920]   You don't want somebody else to do this
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:49.200]   Twitter being made whole is whole is one thing but the SEC stepping up and doing what they should do is a whole other thing
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.400]   Sir punishment. Yes. Yeah. I am one two-punk. We'll see if that happens. It's it's also
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.640]   Affected Tesla too. Yeah, like if that theory is correct and stuff
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.760]   He's got a lot of equity in a lot of positions and he was mushing them around so
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:09.360]   And possibly not in the way in the transparent way that it's supposed to happen
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.360]   It's in a way the point of any court too is to preserve our faith in the rule of law
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.640]   You know, um if you if you go to a country
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.880]   I use egypt as an example because I have some direct experience there where
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:27.040]   You can you can do something because you know somebody in the government or you pay the right bribes
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.960]   It undermines everybody's faith in the fairness the essential fairness in the rule of law
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:36.080]   And as soon as that starts to crumble it all comes tumbling down. That's why trump needs to be
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.120]   Taken to task. It's why elan needs to be taken to task
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.920]   If we want this country to continue to operate if we want our social contract to continue
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:52.400]   It requires that the institutions act in such a way that our trust is preserved. That's what the courts do
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.480]   That's what the SEC does. That's what government does
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.400]   So it's that's really the stakes of this if you ask me. It's not yeah
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.560]   I hate stupid billionaires and they're jerky jerk jerks, you know, they're
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.640]   But I would like to amend that please. Um, yes plus one amen
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.800]   Exactly and and all the forms that um that you've just described like we need to see that law actually works
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.080]   And that it works for bad actors because otherwise
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.600]   Where are we what defense do we have? What are we proud of?
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:25.200]   How do we understand our society to function and what do we believe in so that you know, we don't just feel like it's
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.680]   You know pure power pure violence. That is how our society is structured
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.600]   We think we're better than that and I'd like to but you know now the rubber heads the road
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.840]   We need law to show us that we are better than that
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.400]   Yeah
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   And I can and there's example after example
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:45.920]   Of countries where that has failed and uh, they become failing countries. It's not a good look
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.080]   Let's take a little break. Kathy gas so glad to have you
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   Yay
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   Bedminster golf course in downtown
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.840]   I'm not there. I am not there from the garden state from the garden state
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:09.440]   CG council.com is her website. Uh, what kind of you keep saying you don't do this kind of law? What kind of law do you do?
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:17.200]   I am internet law. I usually say of some tech policy generally, um, and then first amendment civil liberties type law
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.480]   Good's the good kind all jobs work the good kind
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.200]   Jeff Jarvis. He's keeping us honest as a professor of journalism at the
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.440]   wonderful city university of new york and uh, are of course a stalwart of this show
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:37.600]   Uh, and and the chief and he democratic officer. We also thank mr
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:44.080]   Prut for being here the voice of reason the calm voice. I'm just keeping the seat warm right now
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:52.480]   Well, you're doing a lot of pass and in trying my best not to say anymore. It's splitives on air. Sorry
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:58.080]   It is tempting though. Isn't it? I don't blame you our show today brought to you by new relic
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.200]   Oh lordy if you're a software engineer, you know
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:09.040]   That late night phone call just waiting to happen the phone rings the slack buzzes whatever it is that gets you out of bed
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.680]   And there's an alert and something's broken
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.440]   Now you got your whole team scrambling you the the boss is calling
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.360]   You got tool after tool after tool you're firing up
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.160]   No one it's like a fire drill. No one knows what's happening
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:30.480]   This is all because you have not implemented observability in your networks and systems according to new relic report
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.440]   Only half of all organizations are doing so
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:41.760]   And it's clear maintaining network observability is a big issue for companies around the world. That's why you choose new relic
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.240]   New relic
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:51.600]   It's all in one 16 different monitoring products with them all in one place your engineering team can see their entire

[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.480]   No management headaches just just the info you need
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.880]   Network performance monitoring that goes across all the silos you got a system wide
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.600]   System wide correlated view
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:27.200]   Most importantly, I think pinpoint issues down to the line of code so you go. Oh, oh whoops
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:32.720]   And you can fix it quick and whether you're a cloud native startup or a fortune 500 company

[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.680]   They asked what do you want? He said meat
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:51.680]   I'm a simple man. I don't want to make me sweat
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.480]   Somebody asked for a pesto pizza. Come on get out of here. Go away get out of here
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:02.160]   Russell wanted pesto. All right, what are you guys talking about eating pizza in california?
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:07.920]   I know it's not the real but this is chicago style so it's deep dish so it's not like what you're getting out there in beautiful new jersey
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.680]   I was really thrilled when we were in rhod island
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:17.200]   That frank pepes pizza napolitano has opened a warwick rhod island branch
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.120]   So that's the only real pizza pepes pizza in new haven
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:28.320]   Hi, I you'll remember that I ruled that uh jino's east was the best of the country. That's a chicago style
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:33.280]   Yeah, we have a it's very similar to jino's actually old chicago pizza here. It's pretty good
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:40.320]   Jeff when he was this at entertainment weekly people people when he worked at people was like the pizza guy
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:46.400]   Wow, but a lot of new yorkers really hit your guts after that
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.000]   johnson new york was fast now. Oh, okay good. We need to add that to his lower half
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.680]   Yeah, really I was on the menu at, uh jino's east
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.000]   Uh, how are the menu we have to delaminate this and add it
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.280]   Mr. Burke where is the google doc? Oh, let me add it to the
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.680]   working on my first lamination and he's on
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.800]   Oh, this is like the fourth
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:15.680]   Google shareholder former tv guy critic frank sennacher called him abomaree crock called him a nickel millionaire
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.560]   murphy brown called him a bottomless pit of hate
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:24.720]   Formally one of san francisco's 100 most eligible bachelor's he lived in the new jersey tomato fields
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.360]   The human d-dust these are all things. He's called himself l hefei detaco bell
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.040]   Does not take criticism? Well trapped in the jungle gym of life

[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.520]   Offer all about an avoid email of the week for november 23rd 2021
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:45.760]   And almost a new jersey mall mogul ladies gentlemen i give you
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.480]   And line
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:54.560]   191 is meeting on the cover of jino's east like a pizza menu cover boy
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:55.920]   so
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   So we have to add this to the um
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.960]   to the google doc
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:06.640]   I gave jino's east five pies in my very scientific survey for people
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.440]   And so as a result
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:13.040]   They made him a menu and what was the jeff jarvis pizza
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:21.040]   What do you mean i had ordered pepperoni? Oh, what do you expect? I thought you but did they name him pizza after you?
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.560]   Is that what you know? No, no, no, no, no, no
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.800]   They just put the men they put my review on the cover. Oh, it's it's on the menu. That's it. That's me
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.520]   That's my review on the cover of my jeff jarvis. Is it still there?
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.920]   No, I don't think so
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.960]   Was for years 1980s like who's Jeff Jarvis? You don't really want to say i would trust a
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.080]   30 year old
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:47.840]   40 year old and then when I wrote a review of jino's east when it came to san francisco
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.760]   For the examiner under the headline a burp to remember
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:57.920]   They posted a copy of that review and every jino's east in the country
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.800]   Wow, I would be able to go in and see remember kids. There's me and it run away in barris
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.080]   you were
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:09.600]   Peripherally a question on jeopardy about a month ago. Did you know that no I know I said
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.760]   you know, um
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.760]   It was about the satellite
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.880]   Oh skylight skylight. Oh they said
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.320]   This satellite no no the san francisco examiner
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.480]   offered a whatever
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.880]   $10,000 prize for a piece of this satellite when it crashed on the earth
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.560]   And the answer was what is skylight skylab skylab?
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:35.040]   So I thought of you when I saw that and I knew the answer by the way
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:39.520]   Yeah, there's here's another let me see i'll put another image up. Yeah, it's okay
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:46.960]   Oh, but not me although me you might be interested to know that according to nasa
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.840]   the
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.480]   The asteroid benu be ennu
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:57.120]   Is it surfaces close to a plastic ball pit?
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.920]   You might be interested to know that this is interesting
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.680]   Uh, and they were puzzled because back in 2020
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.200]   The osyrus spacecraft was supposed to land
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.320]   On benu where you may remember this an asteroid 200 million miles from the earth
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.960]   collect a small sample and come back
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:21.760]   But when the spacecraft started to go down, I realized it would have sunk into beno had it not
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:27.040]   Fired its thrusters to back away immediately after it grabbed the dust and rock
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.000]   It was starting to sink into the it turns out the particles making up benu's exterior
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.040]   Are so loosely packed and lightly bound to each other that if a person were to step out on a benu
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:42.160]   They would feel very little resistance as if stepping into a pit of plastic balls
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.720]   That are popular play areas for kids
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.160]   Thanks for the answer. Yeah, first most the ball pit. No, that's it. That's it. That's it
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:56.160]   How deep like how they didn't say that like how how it's like if it only goes up to your knees
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:01.440]   Okay, fine if it's a little bit higher than you're gonna have a quick say yeah, yeah
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:09.440]   I mean atmosphere may also be a problem. So you you may have other issues, but that sounds like an issue unto itself
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.960]   Anyway, yeah, I mean they don't I wish they would say you know how deep would you sink?
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:21.200]   How deep is your ball pit deep is your ball pit? I really want to know
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:29.200]   Plus when it took off did it need the resistance of taking off from the astroid imagine the flying ball pit balls from the ball pit
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.480]   And it just scattered the whole damn thing and ruined the asteroid. I don't know they made a mess on benu
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.640]   You've ruined that asteroid
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.600]   Go to your room
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.800]   It'll run into eelons tesla in space
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:50.880]   All right back to work you guys unlike unlike the twitter employees who apparently have completely lost
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.840]   all uh their mojo
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:57:01.520]   Twitter twitter is according to wired magazine as eelon walks twitter employees say no one's in charge
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:09.520]   They're fed up about being kept in the dark one twitter employee said twitter is a poop show internally
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:12.800]   I can confirm that for you right now without a doubt talking to word
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:17.120]   Uh, there's no strong leadership at the moment says a second twitter staffer
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:23.520]   Also speaking anonymously the entire company's running on autopilot a third respect them to do right now
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:27.360]   I've been a company's during a transition like this and oh yeah
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:34.880]   What is the exact date on that because I wonder if it it's uh predates the the I wonder what the effect of mora
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:40.640]   yesterday so does that incorporate the aftermath of the litigation being filed like
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:46.720]   Veterans to think that there's going to be like a an uptick and like, okay. There's a meaning. There's a purpose something
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.880]   Although it's shooting for
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:54.400]   Purchase which may not actually enthuse most of the twitter employees, but it's so it's twitter fighting back
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.760]   So they maybe that's something in fact it had according to wired
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:05.200]   We we've been told nothing by senior management internal communications about the latest developments have been limited to a message pointing users to a tweet
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.680]   By a company chair bret taylor who said
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:14.800]   We're gonna sue. This was so it was prior to them filing the soup, but they did say we planned to pursue legal action in the chance to record
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.360]   uh employees have been asked not to add their own comments to that post
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.400]   Uh one employee says every time I find out something about twitter I found out on twitter
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:30.320]   I find out about the musk news via friends not through my own company, which has been a consistent issue
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.400]   from the beginning
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.760]   liner
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.400]   The tricky thing is that's actually
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:42.080]   You know from the lawyer perspective, that's good like you kind of want that information
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:49.440]   Discipline because you don't want and this is kind of musk has used this before where wayward twitter people have said things have vented
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.440]   And he's wanted to use it against the whole company
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:56.480]   Which kind of puts the employees in this really impossible bind because kind of to do your job
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.800]   You need to be able to talk around the water cooler
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:05.440]   Uh, but the problem is is the water cooler is discoverable and it can mess up the litigation position of the of the company
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   It shouldn't matter, but it ends up mattering because it creates optics and things like that
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.920]   So this this is tough and it isn't just twitter that has this problem like any company
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:19.040]   Um with employees, especially a lot of employees some of whom may not be having a good day
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:24.480]   And and they say things and if those things are ever found and sometimes they might have to be found
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:30.640]   It can create problems, but not letting employees no stuff or talk about stuff also creates problems
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:35.520]   So I don't know what the path through is this is a really unfortunate bind that companies can actually be in
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.640]   Today, um a famous short seller
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.520]   aptly named hindenberg research
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:46.960]   I I bet your blimp is gonna crash. I think so
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:51.360]   Uh, but they didn't buy they didn't short twitter. They they went long
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:55.120]   On twitter, which has actually boosted twitter shorty new one
[00:59:55.120 --> 01:00:00.720]   They said exactly that we've accumulated significant long position and shares of twitter
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.440]   twitter's complaint poses a credible threat to musk's empire
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.360]   Where do they say that the whole empire on twitter on twitter
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:16.160]   That I don't think that's beyond the this is rose covered glasses for how I want justice to play out
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:22.800]   But if they are able to somehow extract leverage for money from musk, where does he get the money from?
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.520]   Um, and that I think puts his empire at risk
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.040]   Uh because he's not he has a you know huge amount in terms of assets and capitalization as overall
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.800]   That worth but it's not all liquid and so what is tons of debt against them already
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.080]   Well, and here's and here's an important number
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.680]   Um bloomburg I think estimated that if tesla shares went down below 725, you know
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.360]   He borrowed on margin that he the margin would be called
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.640]   And the tesla is now at uh 711
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   And the problem is is if he if he has that is 700 so yeah
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.320]   If he has to liquidate then he's going to flood the market which is also going to drop money further
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:09.200]   So he's also in in a position of losing whatever control he has over his other companies as he divests
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.320]   And then tesla shares other suits up the yin-yang
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.760]   Well, and that just shows you that elon is not the genius
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.440]   Some theme he's even think he is this has really been
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.080]   Not just bad for twitter, but bad for elon and all of his holdings, right?
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:31.840]   Yeah, I mean he tried to buy a business. He didn't really understand that's not a good move under the best of certain and then lost his
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.680]   you know
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.520]   confidence and
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.080]   Yeah, you tend to be a little more positive on the law than we do
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.520]   I stay I still say that he was potentially
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.480]   Buying twitter to put other folks in place to help it be a more successful business
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.320]   Not necessarily him doing all of the stuff that's going to change it
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.720]   But putting the other people in place similar to how it is with space x and so forth because
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:01.040]   Those those rockets doing whatever they're doing and then to do with his brain in my opinion
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.560]   It's the team it's all the other scientists that he helped put in place
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.280]   He's done a good job of that and I figured that's what he would have done with twitter
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.200]   Um, but most people don't really care for that opinion
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:22.400]   Well, so it's an interesting opinion, but I wonder I don't think he understands the business enough to know who was qualified to run it for them
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:29.280]   So I think I think that might almost be easier with space x because like did you did you build a rocket and did it go up in space?
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.640]   Okay, you might be qualified whereas with twitter like I think it's
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.920]   I don't know I suppose the res there's items on the resume that uh that may be more specific to it
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:44.080]   But but it might be easier to vet expertise for something where the science is a little bit more straightforward
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:50.880]   Whereas twitter is messy. This is humanity and human beings are messy and um, even the people who are expert at it are sort of
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.840]   You know trying to figure out everything that's going on and I and just his attitude in terms of his
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.120]   Apprehensions about how things work how the law respected
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.000]   Twitter works. It's just
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.880]   Yeah, okay
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.200]   So he would put in a qualified team that sounds great
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:11.680]   But I'm not sure he'd be able to come up with one because I don't think he knows what one looks like and is it able to evaluate the qualifications
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:18.720]   So under even if he meant well his ability to pull this off. I think it's dubious. It's kind of I mean that's actually
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.640]   Part of the problem with twitter is nobody's ever done this before there is no
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.560]   You can't even look at facebook and say oh, yeah, we'll just copy there's there's straight
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.120]   No
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.040]   Twitter is absolutely a unique business. It's not anything we've ever seen before
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.320]   But there's some acuity that you can still demonstrate
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:40.880]   Um, and you know also there've been people who've been building it for a while and you know, there's there is some expertise
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:45.200]   That's built and certain ways of it's all it's all at twitter ironically
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.240]   Yeah, so they they really need to not lose the the knowledge base so much
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.280]   Although there have been generations of leadership that I think have made missteps
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:59.360]   but um twitter is an interesting company with an interesting corporate soul and I think the thing that makes me root for them is
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.120]   Hoping that they can keep that the bit that really sort of understood
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:08.400]   How they were idealizing free speech as an as a normative value
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.360]   And I know they get criticized for like well you kick somebody off how can how can that be pro free speech?
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:20.640]   But ultimately I think they are in a number of ways including as I said like the way they back up their user speech raids protect anonymous users
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.400]   Um, you know how they even deployed their legal team, which was under the guidance of amak originally
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.880]   I think like there's some really good stuff some twitter's got an excellent legacy
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:38.560]   And so if they can value that and build up around that that core that soul that's kind of been the running theme throughout its entire history
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.120]   I think they stand a chance, but I don't think that's what I don't think he even recognizes that
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.760]   That's there and a lot of other people
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.080]   The closest company, uh, uh leo I think his wordpress
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.480]   Well, right
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:58.480]   have williams who founded twitter left and blogger before that before that odo
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.400]   First blogger then odo, which was a podcast platform kind of
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.040]   I know about it because we were on it
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.960]   Uh kind of it was too early and it maybe wasn't quite the right idea
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:15.920]   He very famously gave all the investors money back, which is unheard of in silicon valley founded
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.400]   Uh after that found a twitter
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:25.200]   Uh left twitter co-founded with with jack and another guy whose name never gets my wringo. Yeah
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.840]   Wasn't it bistone
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.520]   Uh this stone. Yeah this came later. There was another guy who says I invented it on the swing so gold gold
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.280]   um
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:41.600]   Jason uh, oh men or something anyway come on chat room. See is that sad room this guy, you know, uh
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.960]   No, it's like ass. No. Yeah, no a glass
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:50.960]   Was a dog less no glass and he even came up with the name twitter. Yeah. No, he was. Is it a odo?
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.040]   Anyway, oh
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.880]   I know because I was there. I remember I was in the park they were swinging
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.360]   Uh, uh
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.560]   No, I know because they stole my name is how I know yeah
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:08.160]   Asked about that later. Uh, he said he said it was great
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.240]   We asked him on the our show about inside the net we're interviewing and he said well
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.200]   He said yeah, I knew about twitter, but I didn't think either of us were going anywhere. So what the hell? Wow
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.600]   It was half right. It was half right
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:26.960]   Uh anyway, I did find it interesting in the complaint they capitalized the word tweet
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:33.600]   And from a lawyer perspective that was fascinating. They're not using they're they're not risking genera side of their own
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.520]   Corporate name is that tweet was capitalized in every instance that they used it. I just thought that was an interesting
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.840]   At one point and I kind of
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.600]   Consider this an admission of uh, if not guilt, uh, guilty conscience
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.520]   They decided to get everybody to call it a tweet not a twit
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.200]   There was for a while people were calling him twits
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.320]   And they they they trademarked tweet and they said please call it a tweet
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.480]   So nice, even if it had nothing to do with me. I I took it
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.480]   Maybe you could have gotten some money out of the
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.960]   Anyway, uh, as jamer bee laughs in the background
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:17.440]   Anyway, uh ev who then uh left twitter and founded medium
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:24.160]   Uh after five years running uh twitter, uh medium a publishing platform in 2012
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:30.480]   That was uh, and I didn't remember this the name comes from the fact partly comes the fact that it's um
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:35.920]   It's in between a full-length blog post and a tweet. It's a medium-length
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.000]   Post
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.400]   Uh has now stepped down on tuesday a month short of 10 years
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:49.920]   Uh, williams is giving up. He is going to move upstairs become chairman. He will be replaced
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.760]   Which is interesting effective july 20th just a few days from now
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:59.760]   By the chief executive of the online coaching company coach.me
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.400]   Tony stubblebine
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.400]   They have a history together
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.880]   The name reads stubblebine from millier. I feel like uh, it's in the story the time story. He um
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.960]   He's been he's been around
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.120]   Uh casey newton and platformer
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.120]   um
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   writing also about this
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.600]   I you know
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.840]   Basically, I think the the conclusion that case he makes in a lot of makes
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.840]   A lot of people make is that medium could have been sub-stack
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:38.480]   Uh, but but somehow missed the boat and of course it went through several famous pivots
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:46.640]   Um, and and a former employee noted. This is casey writing that for all the pivots over the years williams always seemed
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.120]   a step behind
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:54.480]   Uh quote I'd say you could describe the aviera of medium as a series of digital publishing experiments
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.320]   That often felt of the zeitgeist without ever defining it a lot of the work medium did over the years
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:04.400]   Genuinely had an impact. I know you publish on medium, uh jeff
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:09.760]   But it often felt for whatever reason like ev made it a point not to lean into this work
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.080]   He meandered and everything
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.920]   I think that's a bit unfair. I think that the two things I think that that
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:23.120]   Uh ev had a medium had an impact on so many other publishing platforms. It set a standard for typography ease of use
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.760]   Uh, was he weak beauty and and so on?
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.840]   Um, he had a vision for the god
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.840]   I'm gonna say the word plattisher
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.120]   Uh to be a publisher in a platform at the same time and figure that out which he which he didn't
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:43.200]   Um, and the problem always was trying to figure out the business model for content now in a world where everyone can speak see twitter discussion
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:49.040]   If speech itself has become the commodity, you know, it's no longer a special thing to write
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.120]   It's no longer a special thing to be able to publish everybody can do it
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.640]   That's the beauty of the internet. How do you then make something on top of that?
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.120]   And I think that he was on the one hand wanting to be
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:06.640]   Judgmental but not too judgmental. He wanted to be a platform. Anybody could publish here, but then we'll will elevate the good stuff
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:11.840]   I think that's exactly what the web needs. He just unfortunate and figure it out yet. It didn't figure out he went from having
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.440]   Uh, uh native advertising to advertising to no advertising to the membership plan
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.960]   And he never hit on the business ball that was gonna make successful. By the way stumble mind was lead engineer
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:29.440]   Uh, VP of engineering at odeo. Yeah, that's where I know the name. I remember tony. He also, uh
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.480]   wrote the uh
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:36.640]   For o'Reilly wrote the uh, the pearl handbook
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:44.400]   Of course, sorry the regular expression handbook. So the guy's a geek. He's a total total geek
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.920]   He uh, the regular expression pocket reference
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.040]   Uh, and he's a pearl programmer
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:58.400]   So that's an interesting choice. It almost feels like ebbs like saying okay, fine. You do this. I've I've lost my uh mojo here
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.880]   And ebbs gonna start a laboratory and I you know ebbs changed the world a couple
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:10.000]   Blogger bloggers for the word press huge. Um, yeah, it really set the tone. It really made it popular and made it possible
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:16.880]   Twitter we've been talking about for an hour and a half now it's changed the world medium not as much as the first two but still had impact
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:22.160]   I don't know anyone who has had much impact so you're serially as eboyans
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.960]   And yet I you know the
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.000]   That's fair the plane that you're absolutely fair
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.800]   Is that he never could figure out a way to make medium work five bucks a month didn't do it. He yep
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.960]   He just couldn't quite
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.360]   And that's by the way, those are hard things to do
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.520]   So that's and again given his success as you point out with blogger and twitter
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.600]   Um, and you know to some degree medium inspired a lot of people
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:52.640]   Uh, he he deserves some credit. So I agree with him. He he turned and I have this conversation with him. He turned
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.480]   Um
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.440]   Rather adamantly against advertising he first wanted to reform advertising
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.000]   He thought he had a way to fix advertising make it more relevant
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:07.040]   Make it less less intrusive make it decent and and he couldn't make that happen probably because he didn't have the scale to do it
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.280]   And advertisers are stupid and all they want is scale even though that's that's passé
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:19.280]   Um, so that he gave up on it and tried to come up with a way to get the money from the people and all god's children have paywalls now
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.520]   So that's not the work. Yeah, I think there's a there's a future. This is my blue sky
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.280]   Ramp but I think there's a future in a curatorial layer
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.520]   As a premium layer and I don't know where that goes. I don't know what that means
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:37.920]   But I think there's we're we're at the bare beginning. It's only 1480 and vootenburg years
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.240]   Jeff I have an update for you on one of your favorite topics
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.040]   Ancillary copyright
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.480]   Been a long time
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.880]   We should do a new segment. It's the ancillary copyright time
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.520]   No, no, no
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:59.920]   I don't think we should make it a segment because the news actually on this unusually sit down
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.560]   You know fasten your seatbelt the news is kind of good
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:10.720]   Which is that the copyright office was considering whether ancillary copyright was an appropriate remedy for fixing whatever
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.080]   Ails the news and they decided no, this is not a job for a copyright law
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:22.160]   And so and they I haven't fully digested the the report that they issued which I think came out last week
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:29.600]   Um, but some of commentators found that it was so persuasive that hopefully it takes the wind out of the sails of anything that congress
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.640]   Was trying to think of doing that this was just an extra layer
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:37.200]   Not appropriately tailored for all the competing interests and just not a good idea
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:43.120]   And they're like this is not the place for copyright and so they recommended that the copyright law does not get dragged into doing this
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.400]   So hopefully maybe at least in american law
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.960]   They let's not make this a feature because maybe this is something that we can never speak up again
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.360]   I am going to regret asking this
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:02.480]   Set the clock now and see how long will she like and go? What is uh, what are we talking? What is ancillary?
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:09.840]   Copyright right for those who didn't tune in for the other show or we spent half the show talking about it. Um, although you were there
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.120]   Uh ancillary
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.120]   I'm asking for a friend understand
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.120]   All right. Yeah
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.480]   Ancillary copyright was essentially we're talking link taxes and the question is how were you?
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:30.640]   Could you sort of enforce that if a social media platform allowed you or search engine link to other or search engines?
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.960]   Or yeah a platform of some form
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:41.360]   um linked to a source of news somewhere else that could that source that you ended up at um somehow
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.760]   Charge you for the right of having a link on your site to their site
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:50.160]   Um, and what's the leverage that you would use to do that and let's think about whether
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:57.760]   Copyright is the leverage ancillary copyright was is copyright law the leverage to force a payment of some form
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.960]   And so the copyright office said no copyright law should not be the thing that that causes that to happen
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:09.440]   Um, whether somebody tries another mechanism, but i'm not quite sure whether there are mechanisms and an american law would be available to them
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:16.880]   But other nations in the world think this is a perfectly good idea even though it isn't and are still trying to have their own link tax proposals
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:23.200]   Where if a platform allows a user to link to a new site somehow the platform has to pay for the privilege
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:30.240]   Even though this gives the platforms audiences and they need audiences because they're not making any money if they have
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.880]   Audiences if the publisher audience right right right? This is the this is the
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:41.120]   Cue the reggae beat laster to short-threat. It was the spanish link tax. It is the new
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.360]   um legislation articles 15 and 17 and the EU
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:50.160]   Um, and it kind of informed the australian thing too
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:56.720]   But the other part of this is it's not just about this idea that you took my you took my headline and linked to me
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.800]   Uh, you stole from me. You gave me nothing, which is a ridiculous economic argument
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.040]   That publishers try to make because they're so desperate because they've done nothing
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.800]   The other part of this it was an effort it is an s an effort to resurrect
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.440]   The hot what so-called hot news doctrine
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.160]   Which was an effort at the beginning of radio?
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:19.680]   And then again more recently to say oh if it's my story if I got the story you can't report it over a certain amount of time
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.160]   Well, that's contrary to everything about copyright copyright says you cannot own the information
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.600]   You can own only the treatment of it. So if you know that
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:33.920]   Hindenburg is selling long buying long on twitter, that's a fact
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:39.760]   Now if I explain it particularly brilliantly and you take my explanation. Yes, I can go to you for copyright, but the fact you can't
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.120]   However, the associated press was trying to say no, no, no, no, no
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.480]   If that's our story we get to keep it for so many hours
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:52.720]   We tried to prevent radio from even talking about news for 12 to 24 hours
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:58.240]   Saying the newspapers and the wire services owned that first and it was an unfair
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.960]   uh
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.560]   acquisition of their value
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.200]   And then a p and company tried to resurrect this again recently
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:10.160]   Without success and this copyright effort on the effort of publishers was a similar effort to do that
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.760]   And I'm I like Kathy. I applaud the copyright office
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:19.440]   Yeah, it was a good ruling and it quoted me well, so in the report. Oh, yes
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.560]   That's always the need like like
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:31.040]   That's for for whoever's putting together my laminated card. We can throw that on the list. Yes, that's a good one
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.000]   Sited by the past that force
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.840]   Yeah, no, it's always I got cited in a congressional research service report
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.480]   Um, you know, it's always nice of like you win by showing up and it's always kind of nice
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.880]   Like if all this work that I've been doing like speaking to the record actually likes, you know
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.360]   Makes a difference and it may be like very hidden reports that nobody else will ever read ever ever again
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.000]   But my name is now etched in history. So
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.880]   Kathy documents. Yep. It's God's work and we thank you for it. Oh, thank you
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.960]   Moving on from ancillary copyright to google
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.080]   Oh, yeah
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.440]   This week in ancillary copyright, although I
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:12.800]   Yes
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.800]   Jesus voca in lyston schutzrich
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.240]   Yeah
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.040]   uh
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.240]   Sundar pachai sent out a memo to employees
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:26.000]   That uh boy, you know, it's hard to imagine google in hard times, right?
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.480]   um
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:32.800]   The uncertain he wrote global economic outlook has been top of mind
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.880]   Like all companies were not immune to economic ed wins
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.920]   So he says I want you to work harder
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:50.320]   Uh, we uh, we are going to slow down our hiring process slowing the pace still higher for the rest of the year
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.840]   Yeah
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.000]   Well, uh, but we'll focus on engineering technical and other critical rules
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.640]   And make sure the great talent we do hire
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   Is aligned with our long-term priorities. I mean you weren't doing that before okay fine
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.200]   But moving forward
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.200]   Googlers, we need to be more
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.640]   Entrepreneurial working with greater urgency
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:16.960]   Sharper focus and there we do hunger than we've shown on sunny your days
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.000]   So how do you be entrepreneurial? I can't read that size
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:27.840]   I'm just glad to hear him say focus because I tell you that's been his problem from day one
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.000]   Google is about your ad
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.360]   And focus is as all they need
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:39.440]   Solly need well, but the focus you're looking for is a greater company focus
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:45.040]   Yes, all this is going to is make everybody focus harder on the thing the one thing they're doing
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:48.880]   And he's the star he's planting a seed that's that's all I'm asking
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.320]   He's planting the seed. I think he just wants the worker ants to work a little bit harder
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:57.920]   But that's the shame for like again, what was good about google at the outset like they were encouraging
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.080]   What was it the 20 percent of your work week was like doing something that wasn't your job
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.320]   And like and it produced
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:09.120]   I mean, it's partly why that google was doing so many things because it was producing a whole lot of cool stuff
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.200]   like gmail
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:15.360]   Yeah, exactly so like you kind of would want that back
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.080]   But you kind of you don't get that by cracking the whip
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:24.320]   But but but yourself in the in the position of an everyday googleer receiving that memo
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:27.680]   What what is the takeaway? What are your what's your action item now?
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.200]   I mean the
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:32.400]   To me is like is like yeah, some of the snacks are going away
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:37.360]   A lot of language in that like be hungry. Well, we're taking away your snacks
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:43.200]   You know that nine hour workday, how about 20
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:50.400]   Um, we didn't mention we should have mentioned twitter played a big part in yesterday's january 6th
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.080]   Hearing uh, they had a twiddle twitter whistleblower with a dupe
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:00.000]   where their boy should have an obscure personality
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.800]   talking about uh
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.800]   Particularly about trump getting special treatment
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.680]   at twitter
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:18.400]   The employee whose identity was kept secrets was a certain the content moderation team in 2020 and 2021
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.320]   He said before we're president johnnell trump or any other user on twitter
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.480]   He would have been permanently suspended a very long time ago
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.720]   Uh, hmm. That's a very good
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.360]   I can
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.360]   I can't swear my face, but I can
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.840]   I can I can do that
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.760]   Apparently people at twitter were alarmed
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:54.000]   By the response to trump's call for the proud boys at the debate to stand back and stand by
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:01.360]   Uh when the twitter employee said my concern was that the former president for seemingly the first time was speaking directly to extreme
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.920]   Historicizations and giving them directives
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:08.480]   On the social network users responded as if it were called arms
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:14.480]   It felt as if a mob was being organized and they were gathering together their weaponry and their logic and their reasoning
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:21.760]   Behind why they were prepared to fight so they're seeing all these tweets in response to what uh the president said at the debate
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:24.320]   And then of course be there be wild
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.960]   Which was uh, december 2020
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:32.000]   Um according to the twitter insider the responses on the social network alone
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.360]   Were enough to suggest there was a potential for violence
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.080]   But what let's think back
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:44.720]   It said the debate the campaign is on if twitter had come out and and shut down Donald trump's account because no way
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:50.400]   There's no way so what what it what it how about the wild how about December 19th? He's already been even that
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:58.640]   You know until the january 6th was when it became safe to do it up and before that. I think it was nigh on to impossible
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:02.800]   Uh the the employee said the night before the insurrection
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:06.800]   The employee said they could barely sleep featuring imminent violence
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:11.600]   I was on pins and needles because again for months I had been begging and anticipating attempting
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.600]   To raise the reality that if we made no intervention into what I saw occurring people were going to die
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.080]   On january 5th. I realized no intervention was coming
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:27.040]   Is there another person on the tour de staff that could
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:32.720]   Say the same thing that this this person was saying about the incident. This is you know, uh,
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:38.640]   Is this someone offered grapes? This is offered in testimony in the in the january 6th
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.320]   Why was it anonymous if it's a former employee? I don't understand why it had to be an automatic
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:48.720]   I mean the the the amount of what would fall on this person's head if they were known like I could see
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.360]   Um, this doesn't strike me as sour grapes where even if there's not unanimity
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:57.440]   I think there was probably widespread concern because I think the talking through of
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:04.400]   Okay, you're right. This is bad. But what can we do about it that won't also possibly precipitate a bad move like
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:10.720]   This was a really tough situation. I don't think it's clear that twitter could have acted in any particular way other than just sort of
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.320]   Choosing the path of least resistance because it was actually wasn't really
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:21.440]   A default position but as opposed to like you kind of you were you'd already sort of made the decision longer
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.160]   And you're just kind of continuing it a little bit, but you know, it's
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:30.880]   It's a deliberate action even if it wasn't ideal, but it's not clear what deliberate action could have been better
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.360]   Here's the I guess the damning sentence
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:40.800]   Quote, I believe the twitter relished in the knowledge that they were also the favorite and most used service of the former president and enjoyed
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.800]   Having that sort of power within the social media ecosystem
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:52.880]   Clap reads a little bit more like the sour grapes a little bit, but um, I mean I think if you're you know, you're at the
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:59.440]   There's always sort of a private the platform because you're an important platform. What do you need is the smoking gun the email from
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.200]   twitter?
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:06.160]   Management to him saying do not suspend in the president trumps and now it's too valuable to us or
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.560]   But there's they didn't offer that at all. It's just it's all it's pretty much hearsay, right?
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.120]   He doesn't know so joe scarborough screaming this morning about
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:18.560]   By me everything on twitter and facebook again because it just gives a excuse to it next thing he'll go after section 230 and mike
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.560]   basdex head will explode
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.560]   my -
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.360]   I know but i'm just mike's a little more public in his
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:31.680]   Living near the edge. He's like the guy who felled into Vesuvius
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:35.520]   No, I would like to um
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.880]   maznik has more self-awareness than that
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.760]   Google has offered consentions
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.760]   to
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.120]   attempt to head off a possible us antitrust lawsuit
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:55.200]   And its ad tech business is according to the wall street journal speaking to people familiar with about her
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.240]   As part of one offer google has proposed splitting parts of its business that auctions and places
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:08.000]   Under alphabet and apps into separate company under the alphabet umbrella
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.520]   Uh, the entity could be potentially valued tens of billions of dollars. That's what's so beautiful about these
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.960]   Divisions, you know, it just increases the overall value
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.320]   Um, it's not clear the journal says whether any offer
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:26.800]   Short of actual asset sales would satisfy the department of justice
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.040]   Where antitrust officials have signaled a preference for deep structural
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.200]   Changes to google's ad tech business
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:37.600]   If I mean it feels to me just looking at the on the surface that google does kind of self-deal
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.800]   In their ad auction where they are the buyer and the seller
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:44.480]   Um, you know both broker and auction even if they didn't
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:51.280]   You have to ask and you have to wonder and their in a position so they've got to yeah, yeah exactly
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:58.000]   Uh, so I think ultimately the DOJ's right. I think they're gonna say yeah, you can't be both pick one
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.920]   And then so do you think they could keep it under alphabet or they'll be forced to sell it on a phone?
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.000]   They're gonna that's ridiculous
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.680]   Alphabet that's trying nice tribe boys. Yeah nice try alphabet doesn't report this separately
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:13.600]   As separate companies the alphabet results are the alphabet results
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.520]   Um, yeah, I don't I don't think that that would work
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.680]   um
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.360]   Anyway, we'll see so this is this is the negotiation has begun. I guess
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:30.480]   Any moves the journal says by google the restructure part of its ad tech business could shake the digital advertising industry
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.800]   Yes, that seems fair
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:38.080]   Advertisers slated to spend more than 600 billion dollars on digital ads worldwide this year
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:40.560]   According to e marketer
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.400]   Last year google's business of brokering the sale of ads on other websites and apps
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.880]   A canted for 31.7 billion dollars of revenue 12 percent of the total
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.400]   That was a big part of their uh ad business
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:56.240]   The question too is how much do they take at each end of the transaction?
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.040]   That's that's a double dip too. Yeah
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.040]   Yeah
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:04.320]   Uh, do we care about the nothing phone? I think they covered that thoroughly
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.840]   Uh yesterday and all about android instance. It will not be available in the us who cares by right?
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:15.520]   Who cares we don't care. It's nothing to us if it's it's it's not america
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:17.440]   Who cares?
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.720]   To me
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:23.040]   Sajevas rimshot although it's weird these leds on the back. It's just it's just weird
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:25.760]   Yeah, it is 299
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:33.440]   Uh the nothing phone one. I'm sorry 399 pounds pounds, which is 475 USD
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:39.280]   Just on sale. Oh you were talking about money. I thought you were talking about the weight of the phone
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.080]   It is so heavy man who wants to
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:49.200]   99 pounds that's for 8 gigs of ramen hundred twenty eight years of storage. I know phones are getting big these days, but that's just
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.600]   heavy heavy
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.800]   Heavy
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:29:00.240]   Why is the pound not uh not equal to a dollar the euro is come on england you're getting that's coming down falling back
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.880]   Yeah falling behind
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.920]   Um, yeah, I don't think we care about the nothing
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:12.160]   Phone no do we care about this is in the new york post so I know we don't but it was
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.800]   It was a great picture of skateboarders
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:21.280]   Swarming the google's waymo vehicle and trashing it on sand in san francisco saturday
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.760]   San francisco is is out of control
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.920]   Yeah, uh-huh
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:29.360]   vehicle was not autonomous according to motherboard at the time of the incident
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:34.880]   So that means there was somebody inside driving driver managed to get out to safety. Yeah before the full life
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.480]   I feel like this is uh, it was the beginning of what we're going to see a lot of
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:43.760]   Don't you think well, it's my friend dug rushcuffs on types throwing rocks at the google bus. Yeah
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:50.800]   I mean, uh as somebody drives an electric vehicle very frequently. There's passive aggressive hostility against electric vehicles people
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:56.800]   Uh park their big trucks in the charging spots. They deface and break the chargers
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:58.800]   Why do they hate you because it's woke driving?
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.760]   Yeah, it's woke driving. Yeah, you nailed it woke driving
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.560]   and um
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:11.040]   There's just this thing, you know, I don't get an either wheel. I don't get actually uh according to bloomberg
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.640]   electric vehicles have passed the tipping point in the u.s
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.760]   5% of current of new car sales now
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.680]   are evs and in other countries where
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:30.400]   Uh adoption has hit 5%. It's be it's it's uh, it's the
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:36.560]   Bottom of the hockey stick it's when it starts to take off probably the price of gasoline doesn't hurt that
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.400]   By the way, mr. Musk you're gonna have lots more compact competition
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.320]   Yeah
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.040]   Yeah, in fact, Tesla's not even the number one
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.160]   manufacturer of electric vehicles anymore. It's china's BYD
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.240]   uh, so bloomberg saturday, uh said
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:57.680]   Once 5% of new car sales go fully electric everything changes
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.560]   And 19 other countries that this has happened
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.000]   in you see this kind of hockey stick effect
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.320]   If the u.s follows the trend a quarter of new cars will be fully electric in 2025 in just three years
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:14.160]   Can't wait. Yeah, I think that's good. Look at that. I didn't realize Norway is almost 90
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:19.120]   Did your dear wife's mini ever get yeah, it's all good. It's working fine
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:27.440]   Okay, so now we still fine with all of this push, but we better fix infrastructure over here in california with all the brownouts
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:34.320]   Yep. Well, there's some good news there. Uh, oh you're you're not talking about chargers. You're talking about just electricity
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.040]   Electricity in general. Yeah, you know, it's it's
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:42.400]   AC turns on for most of the people in their homes and then their power is out right just
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:45.120]   Really? Well, you know
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.600]   Okay, so that's interesting because whose problem is that is that because there's so many electric vehicles? No
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.240]   It's because we have a for profit entity
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.360]   Yeah, you can tease running our electrical grid
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:58.400]   Uh in our area it's pacific gas and their name
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.640]   Yeah, p.g.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.640]   And p.g. These businesses is not
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.240]   providing
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.680]   Uh, you know electricity at a low cost it's bit that it's building power plants
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.280]   So for instance when you get solar panels pge will not let you
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:15.200]   Uh put solar panels in in excess of the amount you use
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:18.080]   They don't want you generating in competition with them
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:22.560]   But from the point of view of ev owners and society in general
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.800]   Hell everybody should have you know as much as as many solar panels as their roof can hold
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:33.920]   If you're wanting to do that you should be allowed to do that should be allowed to at least your choice
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:40.640]   Wait, wait, wait, you could could could you you can install more you just can't send the the no electricity back up the line
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.760]   No
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.760]   You can't even install them. No
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.760]   How is that regulated?
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.760]   Connected to the grid
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.280]   I oh, yeah, you're right. If we were not if we were off grid we could do whatever
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.880]   Off grid you can do whatever we want. Okay, right?
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:58.640]   But we are still on grid because right you have to be on grid because if the if you know the sun doesn't shine
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.640]   You still need a little trickle
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:05.680]   If you have I mean we have big batteries we have Tesla power walls and the idea is we don't want we'd
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:10.800]   I'd love not to be on grid at all, but no everybody's on grid because and so if you're on the grid then pge
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.080]   Neha gets to say
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.080]   Uh, what's going on?
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:19.760]   What a delightful company although then this is still um better than texas where yes
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:24.000]   It to um, I mean it's actually interesting because I think the four
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.920]   F-150 has an electric version of itself that apparently can power a house power
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:36.240]   How I wonder if I wonder if that will actually drive adoption because if you live in texas you might need your truck
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:41.040]   You got a truck you like a Ford and it might power your house right?
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:47.440]   You could actually California is doing that here recently technically do that with any any vehicle if you had an inverter
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.520]   You could take the dc power from the battery and
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:56.000]   Um, I think it was a question of capacity that the capacity was such that it had enough to power the house
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.120]   Whereas, um, I think another more a smaller car might not be able to do quite that much
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:07.040]   But you could probably drain something off of it because you do at least plug into your your lighter suppose I suppose for something
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.280]   So, um, let me see the f-150
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:15.760]   Battery is 145 kilowatt hours
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.240]   My battery on my four uh mustang is 88 kilowatt hours. It's it's not quite it's more more than half that
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.320]   It's enough to power the house
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.560]   For a little while maybe not all not for weeks
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:31.840]   Um, that's awesome. What's your home charger? Is it still still your old tesla home charger?
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.000]   Yeah, we just have a um
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.640]   Just adapter. Uh, yeah, it's the same plug. It's a nima 1450. This kind of plug that
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.360]   Uh, your dryer has or your rv
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:44.960]   40 right and it's 240. It's on a arse is on a
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.520]   50 amp circuit, I think
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:54.000]   Uh, but it only delivers 32 amps to the vehicle. So yeah, you just have to have the right, you know adapter to plug it into the car
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.840]   We have two of those we have two nima 1450s on each side of the garage that we because we have three electric vehicles
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.920]   There's actually a competition for the charger, but because we have 60
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.800]   Uh
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:10.800]   Solar panels and we generate a huge amount of electricity. We're not
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.560]   Taxing the california grid to power it to charge our cars up
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.480]   Uh, we generate when you lose power as happens in california
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:23.600]   How long can you run the house on the battery? Uh, we have two of the big tesla power walls
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.720]   So obviously we'd want to shut down things we wouldn't be charging our cars at that point
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:34.400]   So it really depends on how how much you know, you've got turned on but we could go in theory
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.000]   The whole my whole idea and I think if we got one more power wall we could for sure do this
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.720]   Is to just get through the night until the sun comes out then we charge up some more because we always
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.080]   We can run off the sun plus charge the batteries
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.160]   Um
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.160]   Don't tell tpg any that we
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:55.680]   We kind of did a loophole thing. We got a certain amount the amount they would let us
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:01.040]   Then they say well if after six months you're using more than that and we work because we suddenly had all these electric vehicles
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:06.240]   You can apply to get more so we put another 30 panels on so we've slowly kind of increased
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:12.640]   We are pretty much the whole roof is covered plus you could connect some panels to your power wall only in theory
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.120]   Although yeah, we don't it doesn't do that. Um
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.120]   I don't know might be might be beyond me. I don't know
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.880]   um
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:28.560]   Let's see i'm i'm going through let's do one more break and then we do have a change log
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:32.960]   Kathy has some good articles. I want to talk about the copia institute
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.920]   vulnerable people
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.800]   Uh, we did the lights on jeeze chukra joo
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:46.240]   And played the reggae yeah and play the reggae the inform act probably should go after that one
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.200]   I want to talk about the jewel cigarette ban
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:55.120]   Ooh because that kind of bugs me to be honest with you. I understand libertarians coming out
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.840]   Well if the FDA wants to ban something ban tobacco
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:04.800]   There we go. Why are they banning e e-segs and not tobacco?
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:12.640]   I'll tell you what profit. No, they're not allowed if it's no, they're not allowed to ban tobacco
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:17.040]   They're not allowed because big tobacco
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.920]   Got a law passed that said oh
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:24.640]   You can't ban tobacco. Thank you rj rentals
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.280]   um
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.320]   But so meanwhile
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:38.640]   The FDA can regulate this back industry, but with certain limitations for instance nicotine and cigarette products cannot be banned
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.040]   flavorings
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:48.960]   Like mint and fruit can so at first the FDA banned fruit flavored jewels and I think that's appropriate because the issue is
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:53.600]   I you know, I think e-cigarettes are a better choice for smokers
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.280]   If you're smoking if you're burning tobacco to get your nick fix
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:00.320]   If you need the nicotine you should be using an e-cigarette
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.760]   All the evidence is that's much better for you than burning the tobacco
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:10.480]   The problem is with these fruit flavors you get kids for the first time smoking using e-cigarettes
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:14.160]   So that is and I understand that's why they banned it
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:20.000]   But it pisses me off that it's completely legal to sell moral burrows, but not jewels
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.840]   is just
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:27.440]   Mind-boggling and by the way, there's another loophole the only reason you can't sell jewels is because they're refillable
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:30.000]   You can sell disposable e-sigs. They're not banned
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:39.760]   What do you think about FDA proposing to ban menthol cigarettes? That's fine. I you know if that is it because it attracts kids
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:48.320]   Uh, well, it's because it's flavored, but it's also an issue that that menthol ranks higher with black consumers in the black community
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:51.040]   Yep. Yep
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:56.480]   Why is it more popular in the black community? Is it actively sold to black consumers?
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:04.960]   I know there's you know ads for cools billboards outside of you know stores and black. I couldn't tell you why but I know that's all that's ever smoked
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:07.760]   Yeah, uh in the communities. I've been in this you know
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:14.400]   populated by black people's menthols. It was never the Marburos if you can't buy the menthols if you can't buy your cools
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.080]   You're gonna stop smoking hell no
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:19.360]   No
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.520]   Probably not. Oh, you're just gonna get lucky strike means fine tobacco
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:29.360]   You're just gonna change to a non you're not gonna get new ports. You're gonna get marlboro's or whatever
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.200]   You're I love my favorites your spirits because they're natural
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:40.080]   They're so the dirt you'll be buried in yeah
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:48.480]   Honestly jewel, which is not owned by big tobacco is probably getting punished because they are not owned
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:52.400]   by big tobacco whereas many of these other e-sigs are owned
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:58.000]   By rj Reynolds and others way if jewel goes away. Does the e-sig go away or just jewel
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.920]   Uh any refillable goes away. I say I guess
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.440]   um
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:07.440]   views v use
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.280]   and puff
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.800]   puff bar
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.440]   are disposable flavored disposable products
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.360]   Which are actually more popular than jewel with kids
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:22.320]   Uh, you might wonder well golly who makes of views
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:25.520]   I believe that's rj Reynolds
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.640]   Oh, good. So we've also got extra waste in addition to the smoke. Yeah, that's throw them away too
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.960]   So, I mean it's more complicated. I understand you don't want to get kids who are non-smokers smoking
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.560]   I understand that that's a bad
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:40.800]   I think about jewel before I understood what jewel was I'd go by I saw more in in Europe
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:47.360]   I think in in mexico. I'd go by a mall and see the stories. Wow. I don't know. What's that product? It looks so cool. Yeah, I realize it's jewel
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:51.120]   Yeah, it was it looks weird. It works. It's a leaf. Perfect marketing
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:56.960]   I'm just wondering how many kids pick up smoking because of the culinary experience involved with it
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:59.280]   Like I'm not entirely sure this is the driving factor
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:03.280]   I mean, I suppose if it doesn't taste the buzz they like smelling like mango
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:08.560]   And the look of the the puff of skin that they blow out all of that
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.720]   It's yeah, but that's that's extra things like there's other ancillary
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:18.320]   Things you think you're getting if you're smoking and it I mean, I suppose if it doesn't taste disgusting to you
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:24.400]   You're more likely to to continue but yeah, but then again people were continuing even when it did taste disgusting
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.080]   So I I don't know it's I don't think it's a driving force to pick it up
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.000]   It just might be a slightly sticking force once you have picked it up
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.400]   But I don't think they're doing it because oh it tastes like this because we already had gum
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:42.000]   So like if you just want that the flavor experience there were a lot less like poisonous ways to ingest it
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.240]   so true
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.440]   But look at the salicious flavors of puff bar
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:52.560]   By the way, this is from the esteemed journal tobacco reporter.com
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.520]   The puff bar
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.800]   Which is owned by uh patrick beltran and nick minus they're not owned by a big tobacco unlike views
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:07.200]   Uh is legal because it's disposable comes in flavors like lush ice strawberry leechy
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:11.040]   blue raspberry peach tangerine
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:18.080]   I figure if i'm going to get a nicotine delivery system and it tastes like tangerine. Yeah, get more get more
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:26.480]   Is nicotine I that's this is another question. I don't know the answer is obviously smoking a cigarette cause it's cancer heart disease
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:29.440]   It'll kill you
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.080]   We know this uh
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.560]   and perhaps you know vaping is
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:42.960]   Bad for you. Although I that's not immediately clear. Uh the the connections with covid were not good
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:50.560]   You were more vulnerable to worse symptoms, especially in the in the first one of the longs more. Yeah. Yeah, okay
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.640]   Okay, uh
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:55.200]   Is nicotine per se bad for you? It's a mood
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:00.080]   Alterer and usually levitt it could cause an increase in blood pressure heart rate
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:04.400]   Uh flow of blood to the heart and narrowing or the arteries i'm reading so does a hot
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.400]   association by the way
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.760]   fact
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:13.760]   According that pizza i just yeah, shut up an hour ago every hot dog get cost you 30 minutes of your life
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.080]   Uh there are not an arterial walls
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:23.600]   Yes, but I think the point is it also delivers a benefit which is nutrition whereas what does nicotine actually give me you and that may be
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:28.880]   Oh lawyers are no fun. I've just been handed some laminated uh cards
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:37.360]   Didn't i tell you to be before it ended? Catherine r gellis s squire and ant we got one for you too
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.400]   Good enough simple
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:46.960]   It just says ant but i love it. You know, it's good. It's good. I love it
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:51.440]   So now everybody's got laminated. Thank you. All right. Thank you to the laminators
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:59.520]   That is an impressive operation to have any points so quickly. We have a laminator here, huh? I'm gonna bring some stuff in
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:02.160]   uh
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.560]   Anyway, I you know I just I
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:08.560]   I understand why you ban them. I really do you don't want to get kids smoking etc etc
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:11.840]   But I feel like if you really wanted to do some good you should ban
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.640]   Cigarettes but if can can they do that? No?
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.320]   No
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:19.760]   They should be able to no I I was yeah, I was
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:25.680]   How do we vote for it and make that not happen and and I feel bad for this company jul, which actually
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:31.760]   You know really did some you know, they did it all right. They marketed it. They made a beautiful product they
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:37.840]   All right. Anyway, I think that's the criticism of them they marketed they were successful kind of like yeah
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:42.880]   Yeah, they were kind of if they were sort of this and they might have made some bad decisions
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.640]   But if they were just kind of in the shadows of like
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:49.040]   It's not smoking or something like that is that an alternative
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:54.960]   Um, I don't know. I I think they just were too popular and it blew up in them jul by the way
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.800]   It was eventually bought by Altria, which is the cleverly disguised name of Philip Morris
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:09.440]   But you know if I made tobacco cigarettes, I absolutely would say well, what's next, you know, let's uh
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:19.200]   They invested 12.8 billion dollars in jul. Yeah, all the tobacco comes with khaki laki done it north khaki laki in virginia. Mm-hmm
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.400]   One of my favorite
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:27.440]   Episodes of madman. I think it's like the second episode. They're they're trying to save the tobacco company
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.400]   There which is their big client is an ad agency in madman and
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:41.360]   Don who's just the best ad guy ever talks to the executive? Well, what is it? How do you make your how do you make your cigarettes?
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:46.720]   And he says well, you know, we picked the tobacco and and we toast then we get cook it and then we put it up and he says
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:51.360]   So it's toasted well. Yeah, it's we cook it in the oven. It's toasted
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.320]   That's it. That's our slogan
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:46:00.240]   That's so freaking good. The guy says well, but yeah, but every cigarette is toasted. No, no only
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.960]   whatever winston it's toasted
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:12.880]   And I love that it's a great episode to watch because the problem these cigarette companies have is that that now people know it's killing you
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:18.400]   Like this is it that the period in the early 60s when it's starting to come out these caused cancer
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.440]   And and the cigarette companies can no longer
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:26.080]   You know without with a straight face safe four out of five doctors recommend
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:29.520]   Yeah, you smoke winstance. So they need some other
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:37.120]   You know benefit and they're desperate because they got nothing. They're all the say it's a commodity product. Obviously it's toasted
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:43.040]   All right now let's take a no no no our sponsor. Uh, jewel jewel
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.760]   I you'll be glad to know that I've refused e-cigarette advertising all along. We never allowed that
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:53.200]   Um, even though we were offered it many times
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.920]   um not because
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:59.120]   I mean, I'm not I'm not gensy cigarettes. My daughter who smoked
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:05.520]   Cigarette cigarettes. I really pushed hard to go to vaping which she did and then she quit
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:10.160]   So it's a it was a success story for her and she hasn't smoked in in a year
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:14.880]   So it was really a day. Yeah, I don't on the back. It's a very big success story
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.960]   You know what what finally did it was she found out that her great grandfather my dad's dad died of
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:24.400]   Lung cancer at 53 and that was kind of the end of the story and she said never smoking again very young
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.800]   Yeah, she does eat at least a hot dog a day though. So I'm still worried
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.440]   We're not we're not gonna discuss
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:34.720]   Costco Costco has pledged
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:42.080]   Plaged they will not raise the price of the Costco hot dog even though they have raised the price of what is that chicken thing?
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.400]   They do oh no, I thought was full five bucks. No, they raised the price of the chicken
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.200]   Hmm, but not the hot dog
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:55.680]   Chicks tells you something about the hot dog by the way is is bigger than your normal hot dog. Oh, it's a giant
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:59.360]   It's a it's an inflated hot dog. Yeah, I believe the chicken bake went up
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:04.240]   But not the hot dog then and then the CEO of gosco is pledged
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:09.360]   Document in a chat says it's like eight bucks now. Yeah chicken bakes eight bucks. Yeah chicken back not cheap
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:12.960]   Chicken bake. Oh, you've never had a wallet
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:15.760]   Gone wild
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:21.360]   Costco raising prices for its chicken bake and 20 ounce soda you want something that'll kill you fast
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:28.240]   Chicken bake and a 20 ounce soda. It's a no, it's it's a roasted chicken. It's a fine thing. Sure. It's a chicken
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:35.280]   Great with bacon and Caesar dressing baked inside a cheesy bread. Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. That's not that's not chicken
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:41.680]   Oh, yeah, I thought it was a rotisserie check. Oh, no, no, no rotisserie chicken is five. No, no, no, no, no fortunately
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:47.840]   It's loaded with salt, which means that 20 ounce soda is a deal is required. It's required
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:55.520]   Uh, but for some reason the hot dog and soda combo is gonna stay a buck 50. I don't know why
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000]   Might have something to do with the cost of a hot dog
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:04.800]   Or the economy it's it's a generous act because there's a click like a the costo. Yeah hot dog index
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:13.040]   It's always adds that 100 and if it goes up then watch out when caught this is from metal flaws when costco president w k
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:19.120]   Jelenik once complained to costco co-founder and former ceo jim sinegal that their monolithic warehouse business was losing money
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:22.560]   On their famously cheap dollar 50 hot dog and soda package
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:28.080]   Senegal listened nodded and then it did his best to make his take on the situation perfectly clear
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.920]   If you raise the price of the effing hot dog, I will kill you
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.720]   Senegal said figure it out
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:44.560]   So as a result that's a minute of style the price has never been raised since 1984
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.520]   Quarter paths all beef tube
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:52.240]   inflation adjuster
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:57.360]   So 1984 1984 was a buck 50 that includes the soda 20 ounces
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:01.920]   Actually, it's probably cheaper if you buy the hot dog and soda and then buy the chicken bake
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:10.320]   So that is 29 dollars and no, I'm sorry that's $4 and 28 is 29 hot dog days
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:13.280]   It's a it's a four and a quarter hot dog
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:18.560]   Yeah, see I mean, I know I know Biden's getting roasted on the 9.1 statistic, but I don't think it's
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:23.280]   A 29 dollar hot dog. Yeah, I was it was I spoke too soon
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:26.480]   I was pretty before I put the period in between the one and the five
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:32.640]   The the theory is if the if the customer buys the buck 50 hot dog
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.840]   Just before leaving this store. They're left to the lasting impression of being treated well
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:41.440]   Yeah, they're well. They got a memory of the hot dog. That's for sure in the business
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.480]   It's basically it's a coupon off of your total purchase purchase. That's what it is
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:55.200]   So they know what the average purchase is and what percentage of it is where it's like, oh shop here 10% off
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:56.800]   So I don't know whatever the
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:01.920]   Moscow sells more hot dogs than all major league baseball stadiums combined
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.360]   Wow 100 million hot dogs a year
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:09.520]   Wow hot dog good for Dan dog
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:16.400]   When when California recently enacted a soft drink tax it would have raised the consumers cost
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:21.760]   Costco locations in California switched to include diet Pepsi because diet drinks are exempt
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:25.600]   Nice
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.840]   So there you go
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:30.720]   There's everything you ever want to know about the chicken bake the hot dog
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:33.840]   the giant tube of delicious
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:41.360]   Meat left over in accord into mr. Burke nice beef ribs are at cost co too. Oh, all right pretty made
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:44.960]   Burgnose ribs. Well, here's the other thing. Exactly. So I need to make the trick

[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:56.400]   veggies cheese
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:06.640]   That's the beauty of the hot dog. It's a simple dish. It's made
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:09.760]   Doesn't even need to be cooked
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:13.360]   I remember as a kid. I had a friend would eat hot dogs raw to the package
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:15.680]   He said yeah, my family does that
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.560]   They're pretty good. It's real my family does that really?
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.640]   You know, I grew up on

[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:41.440]   Speed up transport and always be available. I think that's a fantastic solution. We've been using that for years
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:44.720]   I think unofficially, I don't think they call it the storage optimization system
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:49.280]   They just very kindly let us store our stuff on the cash fly servers. That makes a big difference
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:51.680]   You ought to check that out plus

[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:12.320]   Good
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:27.680]   The last major release of android 13 beta 4 is out for pixel phones and anybody who is on the beta
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:30.880]   Plan that means we're close to android 13
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:37.040]   Uh, in fact, you might want to try it on your pixel 6 because i'm hearing now that we're really close to release
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:40.160]   Uh, it's very stable a lot of people says no no
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:47.760]   Okay, we don't need to get the production versions right now. Okay. All right
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:53.440]   Good deals right now. That's right the ant version of one star on yelp. Just that just that expression
[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:59.120]   What is it doesn't jordan pewl have a movie called nope? That's it nope sure does
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:02.000]   Nope, i'm gonna do it
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.520]   Uh
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:08.720]   Right now is a good time though. I know i do you like your are you happy or with your pixel 6 now ant are you?
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:14.880]   I am they they did fix some things over the last several months and the different patches and whatnot
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:17.840]   But it's still just frustrate the crap out of me that
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:23.120]   The production version was so buggy on day one. It's just not cool
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:30.480]   Well, if you've been thinking about pixel 6 i'm seeing discounts all over amazon prime discount down of 499. That's $400 off
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:33.280]   um, I think you're six
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:37.840]   Or since that's the third deal. That's the six. I think the six xl is all or six pro is also
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:41.760]   Uh being mightily discounted the five is a is too soon
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:46.640]   The good news ant is now googlers are hungry. So that should that's right
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:49.360]   They're focused
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.880]   Yeah, can i get more
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:56.480]   They get more snacks when they get that product out the door no snacks for you or apparently they're taking away the snacks to hope
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:00.080]   You know that they're not like wasting their time eating the snacks instead of building a better
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:05.360]   Work harder focus focus. Oh, it's already sold out scooter x says never mind
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:11.440]   Uh, but keep your IP because prime day continues there and it's not just prime day. You've got to the google store. I see
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:13.840]   Yeah, 200 dollars off and things
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:18.560]   Uh the google duo merger with meat starts rolling out today. Oh
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:21.680]   So
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:23.360]   No
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:28.000]   What was the name final eyes on meat? It's just meat just meat
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:33.200]   Uh, there are some new features on in duo
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:38.400]   Uh a handful of users are seeing duo is getting even better just under the search field
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:44.080]   Uh your duo app will become meat with a new name and icon and more features like background effects
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:46.800]   after tapping the fab
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:48.960]   floating action button
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:51.280]   Which drops call and just says new
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:56.640]   You know how options to create a new meeting and schedule a google calendar. That's the meat side
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:00.400]   Uh, why why?
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:06.400]   So I think I said that before but like and I was thinking about this in the earlier conversation about twitter and stuff
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:09.520]   Where one of the things that it did really well as it followed its users
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:16.080]   Like the whole way that the the apps and the hyperlinks because that was behavior that users were doing so they built the tool around it
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:21.360]   Being responsive to your users and understanding what your users need and how they interact with your products
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:26.080]   Seems like it really should be at the top of the list of what you're building for and i'm not sure it is
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:30.880]   And I think that's coming back to haunt everybody because you get more consumer dissatisfaction
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:37.920]   Which then turns into more regulatory pressure which turns into bad laws that end up impinging on innovation that would actually make better products
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:44.800]   So like not doing it terribly from the outset and paying attention to who your audience is and what you're building and who you're building it for
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:50.640]   That really needs to be a bigger priority than I think it is we would but they took away the slim gems
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:56.480]   It maybe that's the trick. I don't know but i can't
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:03.520]   Go I well spoken kathie yellis. I agree. I love that. Yeah, well spoke preach. Well said
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:08.640]   I there's nothing you can you just want to shake them shake them and say come on get together
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:13.920]   Well, i've given that lecture before like in and lawyer coes like talking to product council like
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:19.760]   Don't piss off your users because if they get upset and they don't have market pressure to get something better from you
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:25.040]   They're gonna go to their regulators and the regulators eventually will respond and it's probably not going to be good
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:29.760]   So like the fact that you can legally build crappy products right now
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:37.920]   Shouldn't be what you give yourself permission to do you should really try much harder not to and i'm not sure the design steps are in place
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:45.760]   To be responsive enough to your audience and understand it where they're going to be able to architect things that are actually more successful products that irritate their users
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:51.680]   Much less than they currently do but you don't think anybody gets up in the morning says well i'm gonna make a crappy product today
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:59.280]   No, I think it's myopic. I mean before I became a lawyer. I was a webmaster and I mean webmaster websites are still bad
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:05.040]   Good. Yeah. Okay. See the the car doesn't lie. Um, so the point with the webmaster is
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:12.320]   Is like there were a lot of bad websites and to build a good website? It wasn't that you there was one right way to do it
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:15.440]   But you had to ask questions like who's your audience? What do they need to know?
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.960]   What are they gonna like look for and and it wasn't that there's right answers?
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:21.440]   But you have to ask the questions because that'll
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:29.520]   Organize your decision so you can produce something that is like hopefully going to do the job because you've put some fun into what the job is
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:33.440]   So the problem is is myopia tends to set in for
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:40.640]   People with the power to cook up really cool things because you get very insulated in what you're thinking about and what you want to see
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:48.320]   And you build for that but that isn't your your market necessarily and unless you've got the discipline to think harder about your market
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:54.000]   I'd respond to it in proper ways. There's a lot of like superficial ways that people respond to markets
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.360]   But to really respond to it in a meaningful way and understand it
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:03.200]   Um, you know it takes effort and resources to do it, but it's absolutely effort and resources that are well spent
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:07.840]   You have better products happier customers longer product better product
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.920]   Market entrenchment and you don't piss off regulators
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.400]   Who can come back to slap your hand?
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:19.680]   Although if your competitors piss them off then they may still come by but at least if you put other products in the market
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:22.640]   You'll also succeed in the market much better than if you just ram
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:27.360]   Portally designed ones down people's throats because you can word
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:29.600]   Yeah
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:35.200]   Uh google one did anybody subscribe to I subscribe to google one I do too
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.320]   If you have a two terabyte plus plan
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:41.920]   Here's a nice new feature for your meat slash duo
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:46.640]   Meat video features no one-hour group limit for instance
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:51.200]   So they're gonna add I think it's a kind of nice. No a little come on for you to
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.760]   Maybe do more with meat right?
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:06:02.960]   Google's where I did that one. Uh google compose window update adds profile avatars right click menu and more that's
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:06.640]   That's uh in the gmail compose window
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:10.160]   So you can uh do some settings there
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:15.200]   It also is getting better at noting whether you're trying to add a recipient that's already in the email
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:18.320]   Saying no you already did that
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:20.560]   Oh, that's cool. Yeah
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:27.200]   Chromecast I do like when it suggests like hey do you want to add this other person because they were a part of the conversation as well
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:29.680]   Oh, that's a good feature is i've seen that a time too
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:32.880]   Instead of because I am one that hates reply all
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:37.360]   If I don't necessarily have to tell everybody just tell the person that matters
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:43.120]   But there was a message today that I replied to and it it suggests that hey you do you want to add this person?
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:48.160]   And I I did because it it worked for that time. I was actually just on a
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:51.040]   hysterical reply all thread
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.200]   somebody uh
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.440]   I won't name names, but
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:07:01.040]   Some a product was soliciting youtube creators to do uh videos about this product
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:06.720]   Sound of an email to 600 creators. I was on that list
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:12.960]   Offering them three to six hundred dollars to do a uh a feature of this
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:16.720]   and uh a number of the youtube creators
[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:19.840]   replied all so
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:23.040]   I kind of got a little a little peek that those are hilarious
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:26.880]   Yeah, a little peek into the exciting world of uh youtube scam
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:29.440]   uh scamming
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:34.160]   Um, I guess it's not scamming. I mean you have to uh disclose and all that stuff and
[02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:38.480]   Then the funniest thing is then another company
[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:41.040]   Which apparently was already on this list
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:46.720]   Sent out an email to the entire listing. Hey, just so you should know that you know if you are a creator
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:49.600]   You should be getting more money than this and we can i want to say sounds like
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:54.080]   lowballing
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:56.080]   Ooh not scam
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:58.000]   mess
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:04.320]   I should find that would be fun to read youtube is uh finally rolling out picture in picture for iphone and ipad
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:11.760]   Somebody sent us an email saying uh your your podcasts aren't working the youtube thinks it's music and it won't do
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:14.480]   Apparently won't do that for music, but we checked
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.360]   Our settings are correct. Yeah, these shows are correctly marked
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:23.360]   So maybe this is just uh, you know a glitch in the early days pip
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:31.520]   But uh, it works fine in android. Yeah, it's something iphone is only an ipad of just uh recently added picture in picture
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:34.480]   You might have to turn it on in your general settings
[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:40.000]   But that means you can continue to watch. Oh, you also have to be a youtube premium member. Of course
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.880]   Oh, I didn't catch that. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:49.360]   Uh, it's available to free users, but only for non music content
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:53.040]   Maybe that's why uh that guy was complaining
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:58.480]   Anyway chrome cast with google tv. It's first update of the year
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:03.520]   build q ts1 dot 220 dot 504 dot
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:06.480]   008
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:12.400]   Ran a platform improvements to help some apps with hdr 4k video playing drm video playback additional bug fixes
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:16.240]   Improvement over wi-fi blue. I love actually my chrome cast
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:20.320]   With google tv that is a really great device and I use it all the time
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:23.680]   So I welcome the update 49 bucks
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:27.360]   Although apparently it's just kind of 10 bucks now if you shop around
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:34.560]   Is it google tv is not youtube tv? I always get computer. Yeah, no, it's and nor no google tv is like android tv
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:42.560]   Um select a o s ish. Yeah. Yeah, it's their tv interface. Yeah, I hate the last three sentences that have just gone past like
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:48.640]   This makes no sense like how does one orient themselves in a world where it's tv it's online
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:54.640]   It's online tv, but not this brand tv not this brand online tv even though they're all owned by the same company like this is ridiculous
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:58.320]   And it causes confusion and I don't think the confusion is
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.400]   It's it's not negligible
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:09.680]   Um and it causes problems like cyber security problems like if everyone's confused about what products they're using and why and how to control their logins
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:14.720]   And their six and their subscriptions like I think this is causing consumer confusion even among
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:18.800]   Sophisticated consumers. This is not good. I think I don't know
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.560]   Get off my mind. Are you saying I need some focus? Is that what you're saying?
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:25.760]   Coherence something
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:29.280]   Well, I agree with you. Kathy gelsa squire
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:32.400]   I think you're exactly right
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:39.200]   It's a very I get well, you know why because on the radio show I get calls from people all the time are utterly confused baffled bewilders
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.600]   Frustrated by this and I do all I say to them is I like in a lot of you know whenever you have
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:54.480]   An incumbent business being completely disrupted by the internet. It's a mess as everybody readjusts their business models and you know
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:56.960]   Companies get aggregated. They go out of business
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:03.840]   It's just a mess and the tv business is very much in that middle of that right now. Although if you look at the Emmy awards
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:06.880]   uh the nominations streaming
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:09.360]   really
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:11.360]   big success
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:13.360]   uh, yeah, so
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:15.600]   you know
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:20.240]   It's here. I mean very very clearly, right? To further confuse Kathy
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:22.640]   um
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:24.640]   YouTube tv
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.920]   Has five million plus users more than the biggest lose live tv service the biggest biggest yep
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:37.360]   Five lives thinking of moving because I saw on reddit somebody posted bandwidth usage by the different streaming tv services
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:42.960]   And hulu was by far a higher bandwidth usage which usually goes along with higher quality image
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:45.280]   And and youtube tv wasn't very good
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:49.840]   But then I saw a tweet from somebody who said I couldn't watch the formula one race of my hula tv
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:55.040]   And that's when I said i'm staying with youtube no no no no no hold on let me let me correct it
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:12:00.720]   I couldn't watch it on my hula tv because I killed the live tv subscription
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:04.240]   That's why I turned it off
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:08.880]   Because i'm not watching any live tv anymore and I was only watching the f1 stuff
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:13.120]   That was it was pointing the dbr or we're trying to watch it live
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:17.680]   I was trying to watch it live when I could wake up. It's like six in the morning or something
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:19.680]   Yes, really early, but i'm usually up so
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:24.720]   This is bad. This is why killing off low cast was a problem because you've got all these
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:31.680]   Spectrum is public you've got a whole bunch of stations that need to use the public airwaves to get to audience
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:35.440]   If they're going to make any money via advertising from having it watched
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:38.400]   And I know they're like all competing for like the carry fees
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:40.880]   But that's not enough because people are turning it off
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:45.040]   So if live tv is still going to be a meaningful medium for people
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:50.560]   We need a way to access it and copyright law has killed off all the rent and antenna services
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:54.880]   So unless you want to cough up the money and like ant is deciding it's just not worth the money
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:57.440]   And he's not alone to decide well, I just don't watch it enough
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:02.480]   Then people won't watch it at all and I just don't see why the over the air stations
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:04.640]   sued out of oblivion
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:09.200]   The the necessary tools that people needed to watch them at all like this was just
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:12.400]   Suicidal on them. They have of these stations
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:17.040]   Yeah, terrible for copyright law and the public interest in public spectrum and
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:23.360]   It's it's crazy because i've been practicing this quote unquote practicing this for for several years now
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:24.800]   I will cut
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:29.120]   Cable until football season and my family got used to me doing that
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:33.520]   We didn't have any television until football season come around because none of us watched anything live
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:35.600]   It was a total waste of money
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:42.160]   And then when I totally cut cable, I just started latching on to these streaming services that added live capabilities
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:48.560]   I saw him. I'm still not watching it much. So let me just save these extra 50 to 60 dollars a month
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:52.560]   Until football did you like hulu tv just out of care having a youtube tv subscriber?
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:57.520]   But I would like I really like it other than their interface still stinks
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:00.960]   Um because I did try youtube tv as well
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:05.040]   Um after I had originally started with hulu live tv
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:10.640]   And youtube just I didn't care for it. It started screwing up my regular youtube viewing
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:16.240]   Um habits because I guess it was feeding my live tv information from my
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:19.120]   youtube account to my
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:20.880]   desktop watching
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:27.760]   Stuff and I didn't necessarily want that algorithm mixed up. Oh, I agree. Yeah, you know, so I'm happy with youtube tv
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.880]   I like the dvr and that's what I do. I I told it once I like to have fun and that records all the f1 races and
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.080]   It's you know, I can always watch them and it's nice
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:39.840]   So it does it's not as it looks like commercials on uh
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:44.400]   On youtube tv. I don't know if hulu has a skip one. Yeah tv is now
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.360]   So what I found out though, this is good if you watch
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:53.680]   youtube tv and I bet it would work with hulu tv on an apple tv you can tell siri to skip
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:59.760]   A certain amount of time. So what you do is you figure out how long the breaks are and you can say hey siri skip two minutes
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:02.160]   And it's kind of right
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:10.560]   Nice axe sir. Yeah, and you what you pretty quickly quickly learn what the various network break lengths are and so we do appreciate our
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:17.920]   Business here at oh never do that on a podcast. That would be foolish. You want to hear all the funny things that said
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:26.240]   Manually chosen advertising is one thing the ads I saw on my roku that stemmed from
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:34.560]   I other things about me based on online activity or phone calls or something like that scared the crap out of me given
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:37.280]   geopolitical
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:42.960]   The situation in fact the the national situation. This was stuff that I had looked into that now
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:48.880]   Whatever streaming service I was using things I wanted to learn more about it wasn't necessarily wrong
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:54.400]   But I did not want anybody else in the universe to know that it was something I cared about and it's now dangerous to me
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:16:00.320]   If somebody else in the universe knows that I was interested in pursuing more information about some of these things
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:04.800]   This is a big problem that we're really going to have to to pay a lot more attention to
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:10.560]   And I say that as somebody who has very dubious opinions about
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:15.440]   Regulation and how it can strangle. I think we got to be really really careful
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:20.880]   But I don't think nothing is an option because this was the data sharing is is a huge problem
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:23.760]   And that's the google change log
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:27.600]   Oh boy, he did not expect that
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:32.320]   Yeah, no, I'm sorry
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:39.040]   Hugo award nominee for best short story of finalist
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:43.120]   A series of text messages
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:49.920]   That's an interesting way to publish a short story Chuck tagger tweeted the text messages
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:53.300]   He said this is the only one that made me qua qua qua qua
[02:16:53.300 --> 02:17:00.320]   He has screenshots of the text messages. This is uh, I won't read it because it's got some bad words and and so forth
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:03.040]   but uh, this is a good argument for uh
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:06.480]   Actually comes from by dyke energy. She's tweeted it
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.400]   Uh
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:15.280]   But this is a good argument for twitter threads now you got me because this is a whole short story in a twitter thread
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:21.120]   which is kind of captured text messages about two worlds and about
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:24.720]   gender sexual identity and and it's
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:31.200]   It's a wonderful to see this kind of cur uh, creativity with the form and I love it that the hugo committee says hey
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:32.800]   Yeah, that counts
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:34.800]   We can nominate that
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:40.560]   Uh, how did whoever wrote this? How did they publish it though? I mean they just sent a bunch of text messages
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:45.280]   I don't know I put it up. I don't know. Yeah, I love the idea. Yeah
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:52.640]   Yeah, but it's a twitter was screenshots of text messages. So that's that's just fascinating. I don't know this is actually
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:54.800]   um
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:57.120]   A tweet thread from last year
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:01.360]   So this was the tweet thread that published it. I guess
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:06.560]   And then um, I think so. Yeah, in fact, yes. Okay. So by dyke energy
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:09.840]   uh aka azure husky
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:13.120]   This is this is her story publishing it
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:16.080]   She's now a hugo finalist
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:19.120]   So that is or or there. We don't know the part. No, she uses she her
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:21.680]   So, uh
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:24.720]   That's great. So she published this
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:27.200]   I love it
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:31.680]   on uh on twitter as a series of images of text messages
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:39.520]   We at one point we had a uh, tom marrot and a bunch of us had a twitter account called 140 novel
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:42.240]   Back when twitter was 140 characters where we were
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:48.160]   All writing an animal over that we had each each would post and then we had take turns posting it didn't work out
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:50.400]   But yeah, because it was you know
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:54.560]   Too many horses pulling into many different directions. I love that
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:00.320]   Um, I think I am now in the jeff jarvis section
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:07.120]   Way. Hey. Hey, I try to be helpful. Um, eat the ritz. What a mind
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:11.280]   That was a smart smart astromark. Yes. Okay
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:13.840]   Uh m s
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:18.880]   CHf short for mischief invites you to eat the rich at their ice cream
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:21.680]   pop up they have
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:26.800]   Eat the rich popsicles including bite bazos munch musk and snack on jack
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:30.640]   There's a gobble gates and a suck suck
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:35.920]   Are they actual can you actually get these? I think I think you can I think you can yeah
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:42.160]   Other similar kinds of things. Yeah, somebody said on twitter. I forget who it was. So this is this is an attempt to
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:47.200]   Uh mock capitalism, but it is in another way to put it as it's the extreme of capitalism
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:50.240]   They look mighty tasty
[02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:53.120]   Uh, I just got to say that and they're going to be
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:58.320]   All over the LA area. Yeah, so you can go in the munch musk
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:04.640]   Uh at a pop up near they also had six six six chicken sandwiches in response chick fillet
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:12.640]   Oh wow and at one point they did a little nas x satan nikes. I don't know what that was all about
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:15.280]   I'm not hip enough to know that
[02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:19.600]   World emoji day is coming up. It's on friday. I won't be here on friday
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:24.800]   I'll be in Seattle getting ready going to cruise, but I thought I would share the new emojis
[02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:28.480]   That are coming in 2022 a shaking face
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:32.000]   Two pushing hands
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.080]   a plain pink heart
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:36.400]   These are some of the new emojis
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:43.040]   Are you excited for 2022? There's also what I think I can hear
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:49.520]   Mycasargent rejoicing loudly right now. Why did he yes was he looking for one of these? Oh, he
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:50.880]   loves emojis
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:52.880]   Well, he might like besides those
[02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:55.360]   the donkey
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:56.560]   the moose
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:58.480]   the jellyfish
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:00.480]   the hair pick
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:03.120]   Uh, this is a kanda, which is a symbol of the seek faith
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:06.240]   Uh looks like a peruvian flute
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:08.720]   some maracas
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:12.720]   Peas and a pods a ginger a goose a raven
[02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:16.240]   Is a pretty good collection of emojis
[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:19.360]   You know, it's not easy to get these you have to get them approved
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:22.640]   Right not easy
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:26.080]   So happy world emoji day
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:28.560]   Not everyone is miss jane donovan
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:32.000]   Have that no she which was the emoji jane jane
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.160]   poop emoji right poop no
[02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:36.720]   Joan donovan
[02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:42.080]   Oh, not jane don't was a dumpling or i can't remember what her no no no no no no she was
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:47.760]   Beaver double entente was the beaver beaver. She was the beaver
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:50.240]   and now jenny
[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:54.720]   jenny eight lee was the dumpling she was the dumpling yes and she joined the committee that down
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:59.600]   chooses right and if you know actually uh if if you're interested
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:06.720]   Uh, and you want to read the um original beaver emoji proposal
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:14.000]   It is uh, what a straight face. It is it is it is published
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:20.880]   Up there on the unit code cusordium, but I think it's a good idea probably to read these uh proposals so that you too
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:27.840]   Uh can be prepared to again. These are very 2022 sentences. They really are
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:33.760]   Just get in your time machine. They really are a few clicks and you would never be having this conversation
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:38.880]   And uh actually if you search for jone donovan and emoji you will find a link to
[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:42.640]   This week in google where jone explains to us
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:46.000]   How it all happened
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:58.160]   Yes emoji day coming up hostess is launching its own uh, uh, cryptocurrency the twink coin
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:02.880]   Uh
[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.800]   twink coin snack cakes
[02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:07.600]   Limit addition as as one would expect
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:13.760]   Uh, they are in fact not uh to be used as currency. They're there to be eaten
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:17.200]   They're uh vanilla sponge cake. That's debatable
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:20.400]   Yeah
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:22.400]   Creamful interior
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:23.520]   Uh
[02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:26.800]   The twink coin look for them is door near you
[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:30.720]   I'm eating my crypto
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:36.400]   I mean if you if you're willing to do the hot dogs, I suppose there's no limits you might as well
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:38.880]   You have the best but
[02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:42.720]   The information has decided
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:48.960]   To put money where its mouth is they're launching a social network for rich people. I mean subscribers
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:53.760]   Since the subscriber is paying as I am $400 a year
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:57.200]   Uh, I guess it's fair to say it's a social network
[02:23:57.200 --> 02:24:02.800]   Uh, i'm thrilled. Jessica lesson has been on the show before we're big fans of the information
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:08.720]   Uh announced that the new system which rolls out this week will have three core features user profiles
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:13.680]   Subscribers will be able to opt in to share fuller information about themselves their interests
[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:18.960]   You can also opt in to send and receive direct messages. There'll be a directory of profiles
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:21.760]   It sounds a little bit like linked in and there will be a forum
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:29.280]   Actually, let me not be cynical about this. I love this news. Um, and it's very similar to
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:32.480]   Because I write all these amicus briefs for tector
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:38.640]   Um, the copie institute, which is the tector it is the news publication arm of the same enterprise
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:44.480]   And I make the point in these things that one of the ways that tector at this news site interacts with its audience is
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:48.880]   Thanks to 230 it's section 230. It has a forum for comments
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:55.760]   It has other forums for subscribers to talk to it's each other. It's also a platform to pro to do monetization
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:58.880]   So we're solving the how do we fund news business type thing?
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:07.120]   Um, it's great to actually see other people do it because it becomes part of my advocacy and saving section 230 because when you save section 230
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:10.080]   This is what you save to this interaction of
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:15.200]   People who are reading and consuming discourse and help feed the discourse. This is fantastic
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:17.280]   I'd like to see more of this happen and um
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:24.160]   I want to roll it into an amicus brief or something like that to point out to people who want to step on section 230 that this is the type of
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:30.000]   That this an enterprise like this couldn't do it if we didn't have this lot of protected. Yeah
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.920]   I mean we have uh twit has a number of
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:37.120]   Ways we can interact with our audience. There's an irc
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:46.000]   Uh, that's open at all times. There's a uh, uh, discord server for our club twit members. There's a discourse forum
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:52.000]   Uh twit.com community. There's a mastodon instance and yeah if it weren't for the minute section 230 falls
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.240]   I have to close them all because we can't afford to
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:58.880]   be sued, uh, you know for what people say on our various
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:00.320]   Everyone thinks
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:07.520]   Yeah, everyone thinks section 230 is google facebook and twitter and that's like you should be able to have the entire conversation about section 230
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:10.720]   And never mentioned these names at all that this is really about
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:18.160]   Uh, this week. This is about twit tector the information all these and other enterprises where you're having discourse
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:24.160]   You're prevent presenting information to an audience the audience is continuing to discuss it and providing information back to its
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:30.560]   community and to the the media outlet like this is a really synergistic thing and this discourse is enabled
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:37.440]   By section 230 which backs up the first amendment values that um help the discourse exists like it hurts
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:40.960]   public discourse entirely if we do not have this law and
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:46.160]   That's what I try to write my briefs about to like point this and do advocacy to sort of say
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:49.680]   Resist the temptation that just because the internet has some bad stuff
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:56.480]   You do not want to take this away because you will take away everything that is good including the ability of having independent media out there
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:59.920]   So you filed an amicus brief
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:05.680]   With uh, who and for what i'm looking at this
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:16.000]   Several things um but sent to you and the rundown is two things in particular. Um, one was a section 230 brief at the 11th circuit
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:22.480]   Um where again, it was a defensive section 230 to point out that vulnerable people defend
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:28.800]   Oh wait, that's the other one that you pulled up. Oh, I'll pull up the other one. You want copy protections for the oh, there's so many of these
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:30.640]   I know
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:35.520]   Copyright law destroy free expression a rare right we ostensibly have left. Is that it?
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:41.040]   That's the I can talk about that one but the one I launched into was the one that talked about vulnerable people
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:50.960]   Line 64 line 64 vulnerable people because vulnerable people need section 230 what you were just saying and as a vulnerable person. I agree
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:54.320]   So this is for the 11th
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:56.640]   This is the 11th. This is following
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:59.040]   Mh versus omega
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:27:59.760]   Yeah
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:07.280]   as of these all these cases involve absolutely terrible things that happen and let's not gloss over that an absolutely terrible thing happened to
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:14.800]   Mh which Mh may be the guardian and not the child, but basically the child was induced to do second something
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:20.960]   Sexually inappropriate. This was a problem. Um, but what the plaintiffs want to do is not
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:24.160]   They're not looking for the remedy in this case to go after
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:29.600]   The person who actually caused the harm they want to go after the platform because since the platform existed
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:34.960]   And this this terrible thing could happen that somehow they want the platform to be at fault for it
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:43.440]   And that sounds very tempting in this particular situation, but that does not scale to any usable way where that would basically
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:49.200]   They basically want section 230 not to work at any sort of insulating capacity that makes it useful
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:53.600]   For anybody who needs it in order to provide any sort of form for any sort of
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:29:00.320]   communication among users and user expressive content if you take it away or you make section 230
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:07.200]   Not applicable here. It will essentially not be applicable anywhere and then forums can't exist including
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:13.360]   The forums that vulnerable people need to a you need the forums because you need the forums to be able to call for help
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:21.440]   Organize pushback if um, you know, the politics are going really badly and you're gonna hurt vulnerable people like you need the ability to speak out
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:25.440]   And section 230 means that the platforms can exist to help you speak out
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:32.240]   If you don't have section 230 then the forums either can't exist or they're gonna have to screen out so much content that even if they're available
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:37.520]   You're not going to get to use it. And the second thing that section 230 does is try to actually make these
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:43.440]   Condousive communities within which you can speak and obviously they can't and don't do it perfectly
[02:29:43.440 --> 02:29:48.720]   But they could give it as best try as they can because they have the legal protection that section 230
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:52.400]   Provides to back up their ability to make moderation decisions
[02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:57.680]   And if you take section 230 away, then whatever communities remain will be particularly toxic
[02:29:57.680 --> 02:30:00.880]   So again vulnerable people are not going to be able to successfully speak online
[02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:05.040]   So it's like you if you have to kind of expand the view
[02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:08.560]   And that's what we were telling the court that you have to look at it more broadly
[02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:15.760]   And I know the temptation is to give this particular victim a remedy and the deep pocket to try to pull from is the platform
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:19.760]   But that would mean that you basically turn section 230 into annality
[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:24.400]   It can no longer function as an insulating law and if it doesn't function as an insulating law
[02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:27.600]   Then nobody benefits from it and all the activity that it protects
[02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:32.000]   Stops being protected and goes away. Oh, meagles an interesting plaintiff
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.200]   be or responded I guess because
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:37.200]   They
[02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:39.840]   Are a chat that allows you to talk to strangers
[02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:44.400]   Um, they claim to be moderated. Although I noticed there's a button that also has an unmoderated
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:49.440]   Section they also say you have to be 18 plus or 13 plus of parental permission
[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:54.640]   Um, which might let them off the hook because after all isn't the parent responsible for the child
[02:30:54.640 --> 02:31:00.640]   Uh that came up in the case. Um, it doesn't I don't know how salient it is to the section 230
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:08.800]   Uh issue. I mean basically section 230 doesn't require section 230 itself does not require them to limit it or in any way like that
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:13.600]   Same way section 230 doesn't require you to moderate your forms in any particular way, right? So
[02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:19.440]   They're trying to say that will be the 11th circuit just throw this out because isn't that what normally
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:22.240]   Would happen with section 230 that just say no this
[02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:23.840]   No
[02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:29.360]   Well, no because this is uh, this is the appeal so they tried to sue omega and they
[02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:35.840]   They lost because uh a couple of the claims were outright dismissed and then section 230 held where section 230
[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:41.120]   Prevented the other claims they wanted to go forward. So they lost it section 230 did its job
[02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:46.320]   They are now appealing where they want the 11th circuit to say uh, uh, the district court got it got it wrong
[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:49.520]   Section 230 shouldn't have precluded the claims here's why
[02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:53.600]   And then we joined as an amicus to sort of push back and say a bigger picture
[02:31:53.600 --> 02:32:00.720]   If these claims could go forward then section 230 no longer functions in the way that congress wrote it to do and intended for it to do
[02:32:00.720 --> 02:32:04.880]   And all of a sudden speech is not protected including for other vulnerable people
[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:09.600]   Um, I mean also non vulnerable people, but we wanted to really make it that the optics are
[02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:13.520]   Um, you know, your temptation is to help a person who really needs help
[02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:18.640]   But other people are also going to need help and those people are best helped by having section 230
[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:25.680]   Proclude some of these sorts of claims because in the bigger picture more vulnerable people are going to be helped in more significant ways
[02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:30.880]   How is the 11th, uh on these kinds of things there georgia florida and uh,
[02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:32.720]   Alabama
[02:32:32.720 --> 02:32:35.680]   I don't know, but this is the case that, um
[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:38.480]   took one of the florida theme park
[02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:42.160]   Statues were florida trying to regulate the internet
[02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:47.360]   So it's partly why I wanted to make sure and they actually came out with a decision that was
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:54.160]   Relatively friendly on the first amendment from where they could recognize the speech issues and had some inclination to vindicate them
[02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:58.240]   It wasn't perfect, but it but it was much better than it could have been and uh
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:02.640]   But they never really reached the section 230 issues on that case and they may in the future
[02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:08.960]   So I think it was sort of important to use this opportunity to start educating the the 11th circuit because these issues are not going to go away
[02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:11.760]   They're going to come back. Um, but there is persuasive
[02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:14.480]   President and other
[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:19.360]   Circuits that they can certainly draw from I think the legal argument is very strong on a megal side
[02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:26.000]   But whether the the 11th circuit just will really want to like undo things just to try to spread provide support to this plaintiff
[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:32.960]   I hope not but and that's why we were there to try to avoid that temptation. Yeah, and good on the copia, uh institute for
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:35.840]   Supporting that kind of work. That's great
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:40.560]   Uh, it's tricky because like you don't want to like, you know, it's a sympathetic plaintiff
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:48.240]   But we run into these situations because the principle of the thing and how it applies more broadly is really more people will benefit
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:52.000]   By pushing back on some of these more individualized claims. Yeah
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.200]   Yeah, that's why we need legal thinkers like you
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:34:00.080]   To be thinking about this and raising those issues reminding people that the immediate
[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:02.800]   Emotional response is often not
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:07.680]   The long term because nobody wants small children to be you know kids to be
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:13.360]   No, of course not and a public forum, but but they're more likely like if you lose section
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:20.560]   230 than the forums lose the ability to try to moderate them at all. So like that's not gonna work out well because i'm gonna protect anybody so
[02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:23.040]   Yeah
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:26.880]   And we do moderate of course we actually pretty actively moderate irc
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:32.240]   We don't have to moderate the discord so much because those people paid to be there and for some reason people who pay don't seem to be so
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:34.800]   Troublesome
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:40.560]   Shared I just hold up the card and they go oh
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:43.120]   No, mine
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:46.560]   It's laminated now nominated now with lamination
[02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:49.840]   Uh, do we come up with a game for mr
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:52.960]   Jarvis I somebody suggest the untitled goose game
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:57.600]   Which would fit his personality that in that game you play a goose taunting?
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:00.320]   terrifying and annoying
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:02.480]   Gardeners and other people as you wander around
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:08.000]   Oh, I think you gotta take that. I think you'd like goat simulator too actually
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:14.560]   What kind of game what what kind of we gotta get some more information about you jeff? What do you think you would enjoy?
[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:21.200]   I think something I don't want to shoot stuff. I understand. No, I don't want to shoot stuff. I don't want to um
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:24.000]   Let me tell you what I do want to do you want a puzzle game
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.600]   I hate word. Oh
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:31.920]   Not that kind of puzzle crossword puzzles. I know what I just I just if it's too puzzle-y
[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:36.240]   Uh, no, it feels like a waste of time because portal a lot of people suggested portal
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:40.400]   Mm-hmm, which I think is a lot of fun. I think about characters. I think I think
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:45.680]   Oh, oh, I know I know I'm super Mario brothers. That's not a good character
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:48.480]   Hey, it's a Mario. Hey
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:50.480]   Brothers
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:55.280]   How about last of us but that's where this this book tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow kind of starts, but go ahead
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:57.680]   um, there are some games
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:01.360]   We're uh, actually there's some good indie games out there where
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:04.400]   It's more about the person
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:10.080]   Uh, it's more about it's like storytelling, which I think you would like somebody saying you'd like minecraft. Maybe yeah
[02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:12.720]   Uh, maybe
[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:17.600]   Uh, but if you want storytelling, there's some good. Unfortunately. I think a lot of them are in the playstation
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:22.080]   Um, there's some good indie games on the ps4 ps5
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:25.920]   Uh, last of us might be too grim for you
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:30.560]   Um, there was- I'll just get on some mad in football
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:37.200]   Settles it all. Yeah, right there. I'm trying to remember
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:41.680]   There were some there were some really good indie games that had stories
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.400]   And you really felt like you started to identify with a character. I think that's what you want
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:49.040]   You want something to be that you can like
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:56.400]   Ah, man. I don't know. This could be a hard one and it's gonna be on the mac. That's the that's the hardest thing
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:58.960]   Somebody said oragon trail not only that you think
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:01.680]   Not even I don't insult that instance
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:03.520]   Um
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:05.120]   classic
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:07.280]   It's in the uh, it's in the arcade and actually
[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:13.360]   Argan trail just added the ability to monitor your steps so that you could find out how close to organ you are based on
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:16.800]   Which is kind of a fun little thing
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:25.280]   I mean you could go I guess to like god games or something like that and browse because they've got a lot of old school games
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:28.160]   Like I mean I only play a game that I was playing in like
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:30.240]   2002
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:34.080]   Um, and I downloaded it from gog and i'm perfectly happy with it
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:39.360]   But they may have other ones like other games that came and went and I think it can work on
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:46.560]   Non playstation. Yeah, I think it's all windows. Oh wait a minute. Did you have some mac stuff? You could there's some apple stuff
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:51.200]   Uh, gog is great good old games and they're cheap. They're a couple of bucks
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:55.520]   And I think drm free which was also important to me some of the other
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:38:01.200]   Commencered services may not be and it's france week. So you can get a french game
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:06.240]   Hmm
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:12.400]   Such that's kind of a challenge. We want to get a game that will jeff will enjoy or at least open his eye
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:15.120]   Mind to the idea that games could be something that's that's it
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:17.760]   And what it would interest me about them?
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:21.120]   Uh in in this book
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:24.480]   Uh because it's a really nice it does start with mario brothers
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:30.160]   It starts with two 11-year-old kids in a hospital with mario brothers and then they become lifelong friends and
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:33.520]   And make games
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:37.360]   At one point one of the games they make into an online environment
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:42.080]   Um, you take it out of the game. So it shows the the progression
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:46.880]   Uh the history of gaming which I which I find interesting as well, but what interests me
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:49.360]   I think going forward is the
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:54.720]   Autor the game maker as a tour and the game player as collaborator
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:39:01.280]   In the process of mutual collab creation. That's what interests me. Does anybody say any sense?
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:09.760]   Yeah, and i'm yeah, do you like board games like do you ever play any kind of no i'm very boring
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:14.400]   I can't stand games of any sort that's the price why I don't game. It's gonna be pretty challenging
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:21.600]   No monopoly. No, uh, sorry. No part gia simulator for the mat. Yeah in grab
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:24.480]   Um super mario brothers just like the book
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:32.800]   It's not 12 though. That's the problem. Oh, yeah, no flight similiar pack. No, that's not about people
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:37.600]   I won't think it's about people. Yeah, there's some good story games. Oh, I'm a handsome person. Yeah
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:40.240]   mission
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:43.680]   The telltale catalog
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:48.160]   Tell more to combat
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:54.640]   You're just trying to best auto my head up aunt. You're gonna come back and be up
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:58.640]   Oh, that's monkey island salmon max
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:05.440]   Yeah, the game I play is heroes of might and magic three. There's a good i like it. Um, I
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:10.160]   Yeah, I don't know if uh jeff will heroes of might and magic three
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:16.480]   Not after three not before three and not the other heroes series heroes of might imagine version three
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:17.520]   Yeah
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:22.400]   If you like board games, uh, civilization would be good, but I don't I think he doesn't like board games
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:25.840]   And and that is the ultimate board game. It's a turn-based
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:30.240]   Games so sieve well a lot of people love it may not be the right thing for jeff
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:35.440]   I think there's some city or our um age of empires, but I can't find age of empires
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:41.040]   I love age of uppers. Are they re-released it and a and a oh, yeah, you can get it now from microsoft
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:47.280]   And it's really I'm really irritated because I own a copy that will no longer run on any usable machine and then this
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:49.840]   Fends me deeply. Yeah
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:55.600]   Uh, yeah age of empires got remastered in fact, uh, the new age of empires is I hear very good
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:00.160]   If you really like age of empires, which I did it was one I think it's called the definitive edition
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:04.000]   Something like that. I don't think any game is going to satisfy
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:07.680]   No, I'm really racking my brain
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:13.920]   There are games where it's a story like you're a your character. Oh, you know what the game is coming out next week
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:17.680]   Oh, I found it for you. I know exactly what game
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:25.440]   It comes out next week. I'm so excited. It's a third person cat adventure game. It's called stray
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:27.920]   You play a cat
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:29.920]   wandering around an environment
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:32.560]   And you have to it's kind of puzzling
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:34.720]   It's not you don't kill anything anybody
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:42.400]   You have to solve puzzles. I think actually a bitty hates cats though. Do you hate? No, I have one
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:48.160]   Why is there a phone on the cat? No, because it's a ma it's a cat in the few some sort of little science e6e future
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:52.720]   science fish. It's lambdum meets cap. Yeah, sort of
[02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:58.240]   I think the thing is your is your interface or something. Oh, that was on bard
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:03.360]   Yeah, so this cat can uh eventually get these robots to do what it wants
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:09.040]   It's pod raise vadocats. I think you I think I'm very excited about this game
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:15.440]   I think this might be the game for you. This might be this might be because it's it's in here 21 in a chat has the best one
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:18.000]   Fun match. No, not fun
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:22.000]   It's not that nerdy. So this one you play a cat
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:28.800]   It's a beautiful environment, right? You're solving puzzles. You have to solve puzzles. It's not there's no shooting involved
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:32.320]   You're gonna get this robot to be your friend. You have to watch out for these
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:36.480]   You know they're going after you but you don't choose that cool. Does it look good?
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:40.720]   Yeah, this comes out next week. I'm waiting for this to come out. I'm very excited about this
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:44.960]   Can you play in a Mac probably not probably you need a PlayStation or an Xbox
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:47.840]   But this is stray
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:52.880]   You're a kitty cat. Don't you think that we did? That's the color of our cat better than a goose
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:56.960]   That was a weird meow mouth, but okay
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:02.320]   Yeah ps4 and steam which means you can play on a pc, but not windows. Yeah, not on
[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:04.960]   not on well
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:11.920]   Orlinics used to play caverns of Mars. Oh, that's a fun game. I remember that yeah, okay. That was that was a good game. Yeah
[02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:18.080]   I think stray i'm gonna go with stray, but we got to get you a PlayStation. We'll send you a PlayStation
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:22.400]   PlayStation you don't have a pc anywhere in the house

[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:57.680]   I'll have to look and see if stray works on leonics. I bet it doesn't but I will check
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:01.520]   You might be able to get to work on your chrome book. Although I think it's not gonna have enough
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:06.640]   Enough power. I have a game for you. I'm gonna talk about in a little bit, but first
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:11.280]   We're gonna wrap this puppy up with our picks of the week
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:13.680]   In just a moment

[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:24.400]   Uh, and we needed a professional attorney. I think on this week's episode for sure
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:29.200]   Certainly not an amateur one. There's enough of those around. Yeah, well three of us usually
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:32.000]   Uh, jeff javis, of course as always
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:37.520]   What would we what would we do about without jeff or what we do about you're trying to find out but you can't
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:41.840]   Away and the aunt pruit. I will not be here next week
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:44.960]   Uh, I think we're gonna have jason host. Is that right?
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:49.840]   I can't remember jason. I think it's what it says. Yes, that's something that's the uh
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:51.520]   Sweet goose
[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:56.480]   Either that or we have four guests and no host which would be anarchy as opposed to democracy
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:01.440]   Well, we need the reason and you can't host is we need somebody to read the ads
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:05.600]   And it has to be in other words a stad. I screwed that up. I could I couldn't even
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:08.640]   You know switch to the introduce the ads
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:14.080]   Let alone read the ads so stay so you'll be bad all kinds of good jokes that I went and jeff
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:19.920]   Well, because it was my fault because I said I was on a cruise because I I wasn't thinking when I read the ads
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:25.600]   I thought it was the ads for them. So what did you do? Did you rerecord the ads then they figured they edited? They just had it
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:30.960]   Good. Oh, mr. Mcgill. But the challenge was look if they can laminate they can figure out in oh yeah
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:36.880]   A challenge was because you made so many jokes about it. Yes
[02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:39.520]   We had to not only edit the ad we had edit you
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:41.680]   I know
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:46.000]   Because I've had a whole stick out of it. Leo doesn't know where he is. Leo's lost. Oh my god
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:52.240]   Leo says he's on the boat. It's telling me no, he's not on the island. Yes. I will be on the boat
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:54.800]   Your best material ended up on the cutting room. Exactly
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:56.720]   Past
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:45:59.680]   I will be on the boat this week. We're going with 120
[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:03.440]   Twit fans can't wait to eat you all on me. Wow. That's great. Great
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:08.480]   Can't wait me to all in there cruise to Alaska on the Holland America euro dam
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:11.280]   Leaving from Seattle on Saturday
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:14.080]   It'll be great fun with
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:19.120]   Paul Thorett of windows weekly and his wife Lisa and I and a bunch of wonderful people
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:22.800]   If I can I will I'm bringing I
[02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:27.280]   I bought the snapchat selfie drone
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:34.640]   But it's broken it uh not my fault. I was updating firmware and now it's stuck
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:37.440]   So if I can get it unstuck, I'll do a selfie with a selfie drone
[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:39.760]   We'll send you that of everyone
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:43.040]   Believe otherwise. I'll have to bring the DJI and do it by hand
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:48.960]   But we'll get a drone selfie of the group. We'll also I tried to tell you not to buy that thing didn't I? Yeah, you were
[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:54.160]   You did you did when the product's not ready for prime time aunt is gonna stop you
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:56.960]   Absolutely
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:01.920]   Kathy your opportunity and I see you have one your picture always a little odd
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:03.920]   Your pick
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:07.440]   Oh, you're the best one. What was the hue huey huey Lewis?
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:13.760]   I mean, I can't really top that so I sort of like set the bar like a little too high a little too early and so
[02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:16.880]   It's been a struggle. So no huey Lewis this time
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:21.520]   I mean, I could always come up with some huey Lewis, but I thought you might want me to diversify me
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:29.520]   This is is this a picture you took? I took it. Yep of the beautiful Baston Haba nice. Yep. Nice
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:34.080]   I love it. I was in Providence two weeks ago. That's where I was not on a cruise and it was really beautiful
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:36.400]   This is a good time of year in New England
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:39.600]   Uh, why are you why are you there?
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:45.680]   I just wanted the day at the beach. I miss the ocean. It's different in California
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:50.080]   I miss the East Coast Atlantic type beaches. Yeah, me too. I had clam cakes
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:54.880]   Uh and lobster roll here is the beach and cape cod. This is a beautiful beach
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:47:58.240]   And what's nice pretty when I moved to california was so disappointed
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:06.000]   The water's freezing cold. I thought the it is cold man on the Atlantic is beautiful. It's warm even in new england is beautiful
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.840]   And uh, there's a great great cape cod shot. What did you take that picture with Kathy?
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:15.040]   Uh just uh pixel three nice
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:18.640]   Yeah, it's pretty even the three still great images
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:23.360]   It's pretty and her horizon line is straight too. Nice. Oh, thank goodness. So
[02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:25.280]   I mean
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:30.400]   I don't think I could see properly because like there was all this glare is wearing sunglasses. So at a certain point
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:33.840]   I'm like, well, I mean it's not being filmed me. You get to snap away
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:36.640]   But it's not like I threw away a whole bunch that one actually came out
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:40.000]   And I like the sailboat shot like the sailboat timing
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:45.120]   I I have another show with sailboat in a different place, but I just like that one better. It's like it needs to be there
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:50.400]   Yeah, it makes a big difference without the sailboat. That's not nearly as interesting. So true. Yep, so true
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:54.720]   Very nice. Kathy. Thank you so much for being here. You're really valued
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:59.360]   Especially when we have these interesting court situations
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:06.560]   Uh jeff a number an item. Oh, right. Oh, right. I gotta do something. I gotta earn my computer. Let's see
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:09.360]   um
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:14.560]   This you just say and then you move on office occupancy is stuck at 50% which I think is an important moment
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:18.560]   That's a number, but I found this interesting. I think we might have talked about this before bmw
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:23.520]   Is going to start selling heated seat subscriptions for $18 a month not in the u.s market
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:29.840]   But in other markets and you already have everything you need for heated seats. They just block it in software
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:34.240]   It's very kind of learning from elan. Yeah, terrible. It's just terrible
[02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:38.320]   Uh, and then the other thing that was interesting that struck me at the same time is boohoo
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:44.480]   Which is a e-commerce player? I think mainly in the uk is going to start charging shoppers of pound 99
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:47.440]   Uh to return items
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:53.520]   Because uh issues can you say wait where that goes next? Can you say no no boo-hoo?
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:58.880]   Yeah, I mean oh no people will buy online because they're safe because they can return things if they don't like them and they can find it
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:00.320]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:05.920]   It's like when banks brought in atms and wanted you to use the atm
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:10.640]   So they could fire tellers and then eventually tried to charge you for using the atm
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:13.040]   So that they can save money firing the tellers
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:15.280]   Yeah
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:20.960]   It you what was his saying about following your users and paying attention to your market and what your market wants
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:23.520]   Well, this will be a good experiment. We will see
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:26.000]   We will see
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000]   You know, does it cost them?
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:34.160]   Customers, I know I wouldn't buy clothes if I didn't have online if I didn't have easy return and be yeah, absolutely not be nice, right?
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:42.320]   Lisa I'm sympathetic with the companies because getting the returns is hard. It adds a lot of expense
[02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:47.920]   I get that but they wouldn't sell anything and they otherwise they'd have to have brick and mortar stores all over the country
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:53.920]   They're better off in the long run if they manage it, right? And if they describe their products correctly and so on
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:58.800]   Exactly, Lisa will and she knows she can do this. So that's why she'll do it
[02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:00.960]   Instead of going to a store and trying on clothes
[02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:06.480]   She'll order all the clothes that look good in a catalog keep the ones that fit nicely and work well for her and send the rest back
[02:51:06.480 --> 02:51:12.000]   That's you know kind of the the deal. I understand the stores don't like it, but that's that's how it works
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:17.680]   I understand that you don't know how uh tall I am so let me just tell you I'm like five foot eight
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:21.520]   But I'm really not so when I go to the stores they don't have the clothes that fit
[02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:26.000]   They're sending me to the catalog. So what am I gonna do? Isn't that ironic? Yeah
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.800]   They say sorry. Yeah
[02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:31.680]   Our son uh has feet about this big
[02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:38.880]   They're like flippers and uh, you know good luck trying to find so they always say yeah
[02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:42.400]   Well, you can go to zappos and that's where we end up getting all those shoes
[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:47.760]   But if you had to pay to return shoes, no, that's not oh especially shoes. Yeah, both that's yeah
[02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:50.880]   mr. Ant what do you got for us?
[02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:56.880]   Well, I have a little bit of a lulls from the folks at lens rentals. They were on twitter
[02:51:56.880 --> 02:52:02.880]   And I thought this was pretty funny and related to our recent news uh twit news from was it Tuesday?
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:05.360]   Yeah, but the web telescope
[02:52:05.760 --> 02:52:11.520]   And I thought this is just a funny tweet from there versus the poor hubble has been doing a great job for decades
[02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:15.440]   Giving us amazing images of space and all of a sudden this new guy
[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:18.320]   James web space telescope comes along
[02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:24.640]   And the um, yeah, the comparison isn't great, but uh, we got a lot of science out of hubble
[02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:27.440]   Boy those pictures from the web are
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:33.520]   Unbelievable. They were pretty yeah very very pretty. Yeah, you and mr. Pao talked about it the end of day
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:38.240]   We did we did a special with an asset press conference, uh, and it was really
[02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:42.640]   Each image was just so dramatic
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:44.320]   um
[02:52:44.320 --> 02:52:48.000]   The most the most dramatic one here and this is kind of nice of the slider
[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:51.840]   Is this is this is the uh karena nebula
[02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:56.160]   This is the most what I think the most beautiful image that the web got this is from the hubble
[02:52:56.160 --> 02:53:02.000]   What this is is a as a nebula and stars being born coming out of the gas cloud
[02:53:02.800 --> 02:53:04.800]   Uh, that's the hubble
[02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:07.680]   That's the web
[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:13.920]   And you can see why there's they're kind of making that tweet because that's unbelievable. It is a dramatic
[02:53:13.920 --> 02:53:20.960]   Dramatic difference. I watched the beginning of the press conference. I had to switch of course to watch the january 6th hearing
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:24.000]   uh not being only inert and
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:30.800]   Uh, you know it was touching when when one of the scientists said that yeah, she did ugly cry when she saw oh
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:34.720]   I would have I was I wasn't tearing up a little bit. They were stunning
[02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:38.480]   And of course, uh, my pick would be the astronomy photo of the day
[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:45.680]   Which I've for a long time used as my wallpaper and it's day's a pod picture is one of the james web telescope pictures
[02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:50.720]   This is of a distant galaxy and you can see the smears here are the lensing
[02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:56.160]   Every one of these galaxy. Yeah. Yeah, doesn't galaxy's
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:54:03.680]   Amazing and this you can get that on a rug now somebody like one of the sites where you could get custom prints and
[02:54:03.680 --> 02:54:12.800]   Selling put it as a rut. So the the the the the lensing is the light going around something and that makes it like that. Yeah, okay?
[02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:14.800]   um
[02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:19.680]   So, uh, yeah pretty this is the deepest sharpest infrared image of the cosmos
[02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:22.320]   So far a 12 and a half hour
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:24.880]   Exposure
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:25.920]   Um
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:29.520]   Yeah, wow pretty pretty amazing the smacks
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:31.840]   Uh
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:33.840]   0723
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:38.080]   - 73 galaxy cluster 4.6 billion light years
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:41.840]   Away and they could have chosen any other
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:48.800]   Grain of sand on the end of the tip of the fingerprint around it, right? That's just one tiny tiny tiny slice on what they could have shot
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:50.320]   Oh, yes. Oh, yeah
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:53.600]   They'll be busy. They'll be very busy. But what an amazing telescope
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:55:00.080]   Uh, what else ant you had that was one pick, but you have others. I know there was one. Um, my other one that is
[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:07.200]   Because of prime day, I've been sort of looking around for some stuff for people in the photography and video side of things and
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:11.200]   this one is uh, the follow focus from
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:16.080]   Small rig and I bought one of these a while back, but of course it's now
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:19.360]   On sale and I really enjoyed this thing if you're into
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:24.400]   Shooting video and you want to have a better control of your focus by doing manual focus
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:27.760]   This wheel works really really well. It has a b
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:32.160]   Um stops on it. So if you want to lock off where you want to put your focus
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:37.040]   You can just pull that little notch down right there and it'll stop where you need it to stop
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:43.680]   I use it all the time. Um, I think it was soft for like 20 or 30 on prime day highly recommended
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:47.680]   Uh quite that gum useful small rig. So this is what they use
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:50.880]   They make movies and they do a rack focus. They'll set it up so that
[02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:54.000]   They they know exactly where the start is and where the end is
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.240]   Uh, and they could do without jostling the camera and all that. That's right. Yeah, very cool
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:01.200]   It's this pretty damn awesome and you can put it on your little mini
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:06.400]   It comes with the rail if you don't have rails to put on your camera. It's it's quite nice quite nice
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:08.960]   77 bucks not bad
[02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:16.720]   And lastly, I just want to say congratulations to mr. Micah sergeant, you know, axis. We got another show
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.040]   Oh, yeah, let's not forget
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:25.520]   Micah's reburthing hands on mac. I did 40 episodes then stopped
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:29.760]   But uh, nobody better to take it up than uh, our mac expert
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:33.600]   Uh, mica sergeant. It is club only now. Sorry
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:39.040]   Uh, so you have to be a member of club twits 799 a month gets you this but also all of our other shows
[02:56:39.040 --> 02:56:44.000]   Add free you get access to the discord the twit plus feed and because new shows
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:50.560]   Uh, like baby stars can't get advertising. We like to launch them in the nebula of the club
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:53.120]   Before we push them out
[02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:59.440]   The club members in effect are are supporting the launch of new shows and we've got we've got we hope some other new ones coming along
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:04.320]   Uh, but this will be the first so there's two ways actually you can get it join the clubs the best way
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:07.120]   I think 799 you get all the shows add free
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:11.280]   But if you want just one hands on mac, you can also get that for 299
[02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:16.560]   Uh, a month 799 months of 29 a month and that is all at twit.tv/club
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:24.240]   Twit, uh, and it's ad free because it hasn't any ads. That's a matter of fact. Yeah, he's doing some really interesting stuff though
[02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:27.680]   I uh, i'm really glad he's doing this. Thank you for the plug aunt
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:30.240]   Likewise, I just wanted to show off my shot
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:37.440]   This is always a pleasure to take the photos of our hosts and staff and i mean everybody's so dad gum photogenic
