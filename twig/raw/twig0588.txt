[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.080]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show we talk about the latest from the Google
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.680]   verse with Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.160]   Hello.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.400]   How are you?
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.920]   We should mention if you're watching the video and it suddenly just looks so crisp and clear
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.120]   that we are moving away from Skype on this network and over to a webRTC technology called
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.560]   OBS Ninja.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:36.440]   Your audio is now using the open source of Gorbus codec, VP9 codec from Google.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.920]   And I think it looks really good.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.440]   It looks better than it's ever looked.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.040]   So thank you for putting up with that because it took us a little while to get it all going.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.800]   Now on the other hand, Jeff Jarvis still looks like crap.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.240]   At least your color is better.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.360]   He's the Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.880]   of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.920]   And yes, he's still a little pink buzz machine dot com.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920]   Thank you.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920]   What's the matter, Jeff?
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   Because I look ridiculous.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920]   I'm out of time.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.920]   I can't get it before.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.000]   Have you already forgotten that you were 10 out of 10 on Ray Muska?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I live on my laurels.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.600]   And by the way, the rate my Skype from guy never saw at Pruitt or he would have suddenly
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.640]   had a new rating, 11 out of 10 at Pruitt from our hands on photography and hands on wild.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.440]   Well, there is some pressure on you because as the photographer, you got to look good,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.440]   right?
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   Damn right.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.440]   Damn right.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.520]   Damn right.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   So we're going to try that.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.040]   We did it with Windows Weekly.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.160]   We've been slowly incorporating OBS Ninja.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.440]   Thank you to Steve Seguin who is the author.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.440]   He's an open source project using open technologies.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.160]   And I think it's better than Skype.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.960]   So in Mr. Jammerby working really hard on it all.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.560]   Yeah, Jammerby's I charged him with figuring out how to make it all work and he's done
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   a great job.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   He's the wizard.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.560]   He's the wizard.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   He is the wizard.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.520]   He says, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.600]   We got to get you a curtain shot.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.280]   He's actually real test will come when we do the change loan.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.120]   Will the change log be unbroken?
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.600]   So this be can I hold on a second?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.560]   So I'll just talk about I can use a snap camera or the eyeglass camera or any at once.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.040]   Yeah, you can use any source of the camera that you would like.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   I'll switch it right now.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.960]   Want to give yourself reindeer horns in honor of the upcoming holiday.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960]   Speaking of holidays.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.560]   I don't reindeer horns.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.560]   Like real ones?
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.480]   No, no, they're stuffed.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.480]   They're adorable.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   I'll wear them for the holiday episode.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.680]   They're not like a stuffed deer.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.680]   They're never mind.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   They're reindeer.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.680]   Jesus.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.440]   They're plush reindeer horns.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   Y'all.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   So you really stuffed the reindeer a lot.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   So it's plush.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.120]   Did you take them from swimming port teddy bear?
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.280]   Speaking of holy wolf.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.800]   Yeah, let Leo have a segue.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   Y'all.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   No, I don't care.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   I don't care.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.840]   My segue is nothing compared to your reindeer horn hat.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.720]   It's true.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.680]   How was Cyber Monday, by the way?
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   We talk about Black Friday.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.040]   $9 billion online sales.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.720]   Weirdly, more than a third of that on smartphones.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.640]   So I mean, this every year, people spend more and more of their shopping time on a smartphone.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.920]   Which kind of is wild as far as I'm concerned.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   Smartphone sales.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   Consider that wild.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.720]   If they're spending more time in general, just hold it in the phone.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.720]   Sure.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   It seems like that's the norm.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.680]   It's kind of hard to shop it on a smartphone.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   Maybe that's just me.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680]   No, it's just me.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.120]   I actually do both of my shopping now on a smartphone.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   Wow.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.600]   Because a lot of it's just like, oh, I see an email or I--
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.760]   Oh, I need to do this.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.200]   You know what has transformed it is the easy payment systems like Apple Pay or Google
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   Pay.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   Yes.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   Or Amazon.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.520]   You know, the best one is Amazon Pay because they're already in my address and everything.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.680]   And if I just push a button that says, okay, login to Amazon and you're done.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.680]   You're right.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.600]   It's the data entry on the phone that really is no fun.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.120]   But you don't have to do that.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.360]   So do you want to know how Cyber Monday went?
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   Yes.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   Do you have those numbers?
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.160]   Which, by the way, I'm taking issue with you calling it a holiday.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.680]   But I will tell you that Americans spent a record $10.8 billion on Cyber Monday.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   Even more.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.800]   Up 15% according to Adobe Analytics.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   So--
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.400]   It was big.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   I purchased one thing.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.360]   But I actually did all of my Christmas shopping and ready y'all.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   Ready?
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.360]   Let's see if I can show you.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.360]   Uh-oh.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   Go on.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   Go on.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   What?
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   Oh, I've even wrapped most of the presents.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   Oh, my God.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   I hate you.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   I hate you.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   I hate you.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   Don't you hide them from the family?
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.860]   My daughter is 14.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.320]   She and my husband has no interest.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.520]   I'm the only person who actually unwraps presents to see what people got me before I'm
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.520]   supposed to.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.000]   But everyone else in my family is so boring and not a whole lot of--
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   That's so funny.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   --I'm very disappointed.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.200]   Oh, that's so funny.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.360]   Holiday shopping independent sellers on Amazon.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.640]   Amazon says it was the biggest holiday season ever.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.120]   Foot traffic to traditional stores according to Adobe was down by 52%.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.280]   That's not a surprise.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   That's COVID.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   Not at all.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.280]   It'll come back.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.280]   That's higher than I wish it were.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.760]   But Amazon said-- Well, is this a surprise?
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:43.040]   Because Amazon has said in the past about half of its stuff on Amazon is sold by third
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.320]   parties.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:51.000]   And so 42 cents of every dollar spent this holiday season.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Let's see.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   On Amazon.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   On Amazon.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.640]   And of that, about half of it went to independent shoppers.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.320]   So that's the third party's on Amazon.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.440]   But that makes it a way to say, too, don't accuse us of being a monopoly.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.920]   Because we share all this profit--
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.920]   See?
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.920]   --wonder with a rail.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.080]   See, we power the nation's economy.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.440]   I will say I have spent probably more than half of my stuff on Shopify.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.520]   And does Etsy use Shopify-- if Etsy uses Shopify, I actually found a lot of presents on Etsy this
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.520]   year.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.520]   Etsy is a great place to shop.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.480]   I've been saying the same thing about Etsy is looking there versus Amazon.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.640]   Don't burst my bubble.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:40.840]   But is there any reason to think that Etsy has the veneer of earthy, crunchy buying from
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.400]   real people who are making real stuff?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.480]   But it's actually Chinese sweatshop labor or something like that.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.080]   So a lot of things on Etsy are resellers for the stuff you'd find on Wish or Alibaba.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   Drop shipping.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:01.520]   And there's plenty of-- I purchased a lot of unique t-shirts for people that fit their
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.520]   personalities.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.360]   But those are basically, if not Cafe Press, but Cafe Press retailers.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.920]   But they are-- one of them is purchased for my daughter, Aahaki, St. Louis Blues shirt.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.360]   It is totally unlicensed.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   Oh.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   Oh.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:25.400]   But this person basically took a quote that she finds hilarious and stuck it on the shirt.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.880]   And she's going to love this thing like nobody's business.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.880]   Nice.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   So--
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   I like Etsy.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.560]   I just-- I want it to be like what you get the impression of is just like grandma sewing
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.640]   stuff and then selling it online.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.120]   And look, I've grandma's found a whole new life making some of the--
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120]   There is that.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.120]   There's some of that.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.520]   But, and see, the company is a mission-oriented company.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   It's what I want to call them.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.800]   So they're trying to do that.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   What are those--
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   A B corporation?
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.160]   Yeah, it's B Corp.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.160]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   So for public--
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.280]   I know the former attorney who did all that.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   It's a public benefit corporation.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.600]   I have a founder and CEO.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.240]   It was one of the first exciting companies I covered way back before I even was at Giggo.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   That's nice.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.720]   But super controversial, like in the very beginning days.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   And still controversial now.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.720]   What was the controversy?
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.720]   I saw it.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.720]   It was--
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.800]   It was-- yeah, there was a character.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.960]   They had to make money.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.360]   People hate when you try to optimize for profits.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.760]   It kind of boiled down into that.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.280]   And it also-- there was a lot of controversy as more people who weren't actively crafting
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.400]   and making things coming on the platform and trying to game search.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   Uh-huh.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   See, that's--
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   But what is so funny--
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400]   I'm so up to you now.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   He's 40 years old now.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   Is that amazing?
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   He was a kid.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   He was starting this.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.280]   I don't know what he's up to.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.640]   He might not be up to anything.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   He may not need to be.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   Yeah, he may not need to be.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.320]   He's probably just counting the stacks.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.200]   Actually as we learn more details of Tony Shea's tragic death, we're learning that it
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.880]   probably isn't good to be too rich, too early, too young.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.520]   I don't know if you've seen the story that's come out.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.680]   No, I didn't see the--
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.600]   Is it what I think it is?
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.480]   It's not good.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:20.080]   And I have to say, I'm just quoting a news source and it could be scurrilous, but it
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.280]   doesn't sound like it is.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:29.920]   Remember Tony Shea was the founder of Zappos, 46 years old, retired from Zappos earlier this
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.920]   year in August.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.280]   And I just assume-- everybody loves Tony and I just assumed, oh, you know, he made his
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.280]   money.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.400]   He's retiring at the age of 46.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.360]   Now this is from the Daily Mail.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.160]   So consider the source, although--
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.720]   Okay, yeah, watch out.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:51.360]   Because they're a rag, but they're quoting firefighters and people around him apparently
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.320]   had a drug and alcohol problem and he had barricaded himself in a shed.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:04.240]   He had an affection for burning candles and nitrous oxide whippets.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.920]   And it was hard for the firefighters to get to him.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.720]   And so they broke down the walls to the shed.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.360]   He had suffered severe burns.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:22.000]   He lingered for-- this we didn't know either-- for nine days before he passed away.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.560]   So kind of a tragedy, really.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.400]   Well, that is.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.760]   And of course, being on the burn unit means those nine days were not-- were extremely
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.840]   unpleasant for him, I'm sure.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.720]   They usually put-- I mean, if you were that--
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.960]   He might have been in a coma.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.960]   He might have been in a coma because they're pretty good about that.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.960]   So isn't that sad?
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   It's heartbreaking.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.720]   Yeah, it's really heartbreaking.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.320]   All the gratitude to him for reinvigorating Las Vegas.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.960]   He was a beloved figure.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.000]   Everybody-- you read O'Malley's beautiful obituary for him.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.320]   Everybody thought very highly of him.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.240]   And so that's a double tragedy because I think that's what maybe happened is he made
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.760]   a lot of money.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:15.160]   He retired very young and it doesn't sound good.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   So--
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.760]   Nobody buys your company, Leo.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   I'll never have that problem.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.760]   Mm-hmm.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.760]   I'll be working on--
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   Web is on however--
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.760]   I'm 900.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   --I see this.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   Yes, no, I didn't.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.760]   You didn't?
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.360]   Oh, I put it in there just to depress you.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.960]   Amazon is looking to buy a-- where'd it go?
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.960]   I put it in there.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.960]   I swear I put it in there.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.360]   Yeah, yeah, there is under podcasting.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.160]   Oh, Jason's being organized.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.560]   Amazon's also talked to buy Wondery for 300 million.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.560]   Oh, yeah, I've seen this.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.160]   Spotify was apparently in talks.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.360]   Apple was apparently in talks.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.360]   300 million dollars.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.360]   Wondery was started--
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   40 million in revenue.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   40 million in revenue?
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   That's not bad.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.360]   That's great.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   Which calculation?
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.280]   And they said it was-- the Wall Street Journal said it was the last large independent podcast
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.280]   for the market.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.280]   No.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.840]   Well, not that large.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.520]   You're a larger than those.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.760]   Wow, 300 million.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:22.000]   So Wondery was interesting because it was started kind of started by Hollywood.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.400]   And one of the things that made Wondery unique for a podcast network is they had a lot of
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.800]   deals to license their shows to TV.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.000]   And I think that's probably where some of the revenue projections come from.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.480]   75% of their 40 million came from advertising.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.240]   The rest from licensing to TV.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.880]   Subscription services like Audible and Stitcher Premium and to their own subscription subscription
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.880]   service.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.320]   So, yeah, that'd be interesting.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.120]   In talks, though, it doesn't mean it's happened.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.000]   No, it's not.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.600]   And it is the last-- is it the last-- I think even if you-- please exclude us.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.840]   We're not anywhere near that size.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.720]   But there are other big independent podcast companies out there still that haven't been
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   acquired.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.000]   I'm sure Spotify is probably looking down there next.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.240]   They're all up on their little dart board right now.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.240]   Let me take out.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.040]   Speaking of acquisitions, Slack, Salesforce--
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.680]   It's a big deal.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.200]   $57.5 billion, Salesforce is going to pay.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.800]   I think it's a half stock, half cash deal.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.880]   Stuart Butterfield, another big payday he sold flicker to-- was it Yahoo?
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   I guess it was Yahoo!
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.880]   He sold flicker to--
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.880]   Yahoo!
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.880]   For 40 mil.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   For 40 mil.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.080]   And some of the investors were unhappy with him that he sold too soon.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.320]   But he said he and Katerina fake when they were married said it was a life changing amount
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.320]   of money.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   It was?
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.800]   You're only going to have one chance of life to get that much money.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.640]   Well, he got a second chance.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.080]   You know, it's a life changing amount of money.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   $27.5 billion.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   That's a life changing amount of money.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.400]   I wish they put out the cap tables on these stories.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.080]   You have some idea of who's making one out of this.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.200]   Oh, well, yeah, they don't want to tell people that.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   Nobody wants to know that.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   Slack's public.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.520]   They've got a cap table that'll be in their proxy statement and they're 15.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.160]   What is that?
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.440]   What is that SEC filing?
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.360]   Every year you do one.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.160]   The 10 Q or 10 K or?
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.040]   No, it's the proxy.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040]   It's a.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   That's our idea.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.440]   I know you know what I do.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   They exist.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.440]   No, I guess.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.280]   27, actually it's 27.7 billion according to the associate.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   You wrote it down.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.320]   What's a couple hundred million between friends?
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.320]   Really.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:55.960]   That's, I honestly think that feels like too much.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.600]   But you know, obviously sales force, you know, Mark Benioff's no fool if he's if he's
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   willing to pay that much.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.760]   Well, well, it was it's current stock price.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.600]   Much more, but the argument is they went down.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.840]   There was Microsoft was seen as a huge competitor.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:19.040]   Microsoft Teams and and they were the ones that didn't really advance in COVID though
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.240]   they I think they should have, but for various reasons.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.920]   So you could argue that they were underpriced in the market.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:32.160]   Or I would argue that while zoom and teams capitalized on the work from home trend over
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.440]   the last nine months, Slack seems to have done the opposite.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:42.600]   There's some evidence that their monthly active users went down and I thought it would
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:49.040]   have been just plateaued because it seems like the whole Slack platform is is a little
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.040]   niche.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.520]   Well, that's still an opportunity Mitch missed when zoom is through the roof.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.160]   And teams is through the roof.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.160]   And and the reason I think Slack might have gone down is because they did not would not
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:08.360]   reveal their numbers in the face of Microsoft every month saying and now another 40 million
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.720]   another 40 million.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.840]   So I'm wondering.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.760]   Slack didn't have video either.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.560]   Oh, I guess I'm frozen for a while.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:24.840]   So without video, I think everybody who came into the pandemic wanting to like see people
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:31.080]   face to face, they chose these other platforms and people might actually use teams and zoom
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   and slack.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:38.120]   That's not crazy because they in many people's minds, they serve different purposes.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:48.680]   Now, sales force sites the success of past acquisitions as key decision to buy slack.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.600]   This is from CBS market watch.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.920]   They say that we did so well.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.920]   What do they buy?
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.920]   What do they buy before?
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.920]   Tableau was a sales forces largest acquisition at 15.7 billion.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.320]   That was in 2019.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.960]   Fuel soft 6.5 billion in 2018.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.520]   Mark Benioff said when you look at what we've learned our ability to integrate companies,
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.520]   that's a big deal.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.400]   By the way, Apple has said we don't acquire big companies because we feel like it's too
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:23.160]   hard to integrate two big teams and we don't want to change our company culture.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.960]   So maybe sales forces figured this out.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.080]   Our ability to integrate companies to make one plus one equal three.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:34.000]   We look at this and we say, wow, this is a game changer and we know how to pull it off
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   and we have a lot of our former executives, for example, at Slack already.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.920]   So we know a lot of those players.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:46.120]   So maybe they do have a better idea as what's going on inside of Slack than obviously than
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.160]   we do and they're not telling people what's happening to their user base.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.400]   One thing I know is we use Slack.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.960]   We're a Slack company.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.160]   It's very hard to change.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:03.000]   Once you use something, it's not a thing that companies regularly say, oh, there's something
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   better.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Let's try that.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.040]   So if you already are decided on Slack, it's unlikely that you would just say, we should
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.480]   just try teams unless I don't know.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:17.840]   Maybe the CFO is going to say to you, hey, we're paying for Microsoft 365 teams and is
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.240]   included in that.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.840]   Why are we paying extra for Slack?
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.440]   We should just be using teams.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.760]   Teams is also we looked at teams when we left HipChat.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.840]   HipChat got sold when we looked at leaving HipChat.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.760]   We looked at teams and Slack and we chose Slack because it had the integrations we
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.760]   needed with things like Panopta or server monitoring software and stuff like that.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.920]   At the time, teams didn't.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.880]   But over a couple of years since then, teams come on strong with that.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.200]   But wouldn't Active Directory play a big part in that as well?
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.960]   If you're a Microsoft house, but see, we're not.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.000]   So you're right.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.960]   That's who's going to use teams.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.880]   The other thing that Salesforce gets, remember Salesforce wanted to buy LinkedIn.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.800]   It was really upset when Microsoft bought LinkedIn.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.040]   They said, Microsoft's going to use all that information they get from LinkedIn.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.360]   New man.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.720]   Any competitively.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.960]   That's one of the reasons a company like Salesforce buys Slack is now they've got a foot in the
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.240]   door from a lot of new companies, perhaps, that they didn't before.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.000]   Plus data that they didn't have before.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.640]   So I'm sure Mark Benney F. knows it's worth that much.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.640]   Boy, that's an awful lot.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.640]   It was funny.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.600]   I got the daily as Tretatri and Ben wore to the top.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.840]   This is a long one when he warns it's long.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   Yeah, it's long.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   Boy.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.160]   It's going to be epic.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.200]   It's going to be good.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.800]   But he said, you know, Brett Taylor, who's the COO, who's really smart, really good.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.440]   And this is kind of can't, but he talked about how it's the operating system for the
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.080]   new way to work.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.760]   There's some truth to that.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   How people collaborate.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.480]   You know, Slack did pioneer that and Salesforce's resources.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.920]   Now what Ben proposes is that Slack, like a company like YouTube was trying to charge
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.560]   before Google bought it, Slack's been trying to charge.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.760]   He says that Salesforce should make it free and addict everybody to it.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.240]   And then it's the glide path into Salesforce.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.240]   That certainly.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.400]   But it doesn't make sense.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:24.000]   I mean, people who had no business or need using the use Salesforce use Slack.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.960]   So and I think there is still demand for it.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.840]   I mean, we went from social cast.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   So y'all were on hip chat.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.680]   We were on social cast and then that got bought and killed.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.760]   So then we switched to Slack.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.040]   It became our like communication platform.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:50.680]   But I don't see it being an entry way to Salesforce for a lot of organizations because you're
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.360]   already on Salesforce if that's something that's appealing to you.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.240]   And if it's if you're not on Salesforce, you probably don't need to be on Salesforce.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   Right.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Right.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   Yeah, the space.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.480]   The thing is I find there's funny uses of Salesforce these days is that newspapers are
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:12.360]   using it as a CRM for not their just their ad customers, but their readers.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.920]   Yeah, no one everbody's intended to be used at some point.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:22.800]   I was like, I've got so many CRM companies pitching me right now.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.400]   I'm like, it's a hot category, isn't it?
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.880]   Yeah, we actually we use Salesforce ironically.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.480]   We use Salesforce and Slack.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.840]   So maybe this will be good for us.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.760]   Maybe something, something like it.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.480]   So it's funny that Ben should say that because I think that that's what Microsoft is doing
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.000]   with teams as well, turning it into ineffective business operating system.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.600]   Slack is exactly what he says.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   It's not a failure.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.000]   Oh, we're going to get to that.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.040]   One more point on this is that is the Ben points out that Benioff has said that he would love
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.960]   to buy zoom at a hundred fifteen billion right now.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.920]   It's a little too much for him.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   He came buying zoom.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:08.520]   But the question is, what does a vaccine do to zoom?
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   That's a good question.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:15.000]   Zoom is zooming, by the way, its stock price has gone through the roof.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I wonder.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.320]   Let me look at his PDE.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.680]   It's PDE is 287 bucks.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   Actually zoom just took a little nosedive last couple of days.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.480]   But it was maybe vaccines.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480]   Yeah, maybe that maybe you're right.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.480]   But I think that's just the stock.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.960]   That's very typical of the stock market.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.520]   I don't think vaccines are going to change how zoom's fortunes because people are now
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.520]   using zoom.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.240]   But you watch TV now.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.440]   Everybody's on zoom or some zoom clone.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.960]   But the term is they're on zoom.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   Right?
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.240]   And I feel like that's not good.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   You hate it?
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.240]   Because I don't think it's going away.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.600]   I hate that they have turned into the Xerox of total.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.960]   Yeah, the fact that the word is an action.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   Oh, I see.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.600]   I'm sure they ate it too.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.040]   Nevertheless, they're still getting the lion's share of business.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.840]   You know, CNN has a deal with what Cisco WebEx and things like that.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.440]   But honestly, when you see those windows, you think zoom.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.960]   We're going to do a zoom Christmas card.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   It's here for Twitter.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   But you know what?
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.520]   We know it won't be in zoom.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.560]   It'll probably be in Mike Google meet.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.480]   But nobody's going to say you're doing a meet Christmas card because that sounds disgusting.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.720]   We're going to say it's a zoom Christmas card, right?
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.040]   And that's what I'm going to be while speaking to that.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   Who's left out to save virtually?
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.800]   We mentioned this discussion.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.480]   What's that Google?
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   That's right.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.480]   That's what we're not.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   We're using Google Google workspace.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.760]   Nobody talks about that.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.520]   We use meat, but Google meet.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.240]   And that's what we're going to use with the Christmas card.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.080]   I'm sure, but it's not going to nobody's going to think meat.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.080]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.640]   No, I was going to say maybe Google will buy zoom.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:26:00.240]   And I mean, the problem, I mean, the technology there isn't crazy.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.800]   No, it's not difficult.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   No.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.800]   And 100.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.880]   And what would you say they're trading at 150 billion?
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   105 million.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.880]   Million?
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.880]   No, it's billion.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.880]   I got a five million.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.880]   It ain't million.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.200]   I'll tell you that right now.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   That's too much for a brand, I think.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.560]   But maybe I'm wrong.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.560]   They are current.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.560]   Their market cap is 117 billion right now.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.560]   What does it do?
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.520]   So if you look at their year to date, it just took off.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.960]   And that's all because of pandemic.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.120]   But my point is I don't think it goes away after the pandemic goes away.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.640]   I think companies will be using it more than ever before.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.480]   It's really been a boon for them.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.560]   Well, and also you pay for-- like, I pay for my zoom subscription.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.400]   I pay-- I re-up it every year.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.160]   So I just paid for the next year, right?
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.200]   Like two days ago.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.640]   And so you pull up these people, not everybody's on an annual plan, but it's also not the sort
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.120]   of thing you change very often unless you're-- you know, how often do companies audit their
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   subscriptions?
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.120]   That's right.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.680]   Well, that was my point with Slack.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.920]   There is a real barrier to changing.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.480]   It's like too much trouble.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.040]   You were all in it.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.960]   What are you going to-- I can now call everybody in the company and say, OK, stop using Slack.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.080]   We're going to-- we're all switch shifting to this.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   Everybody has to figure it out.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.320]   You have to recreate all the things you're doing.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   It's just that nobody's going to do that.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320]   It's too much trouble.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.160]   There has to be a strong incentive.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.160]   Sorry.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:34.120]   Folks out there listening used to be that we-- we can now talk over each other, which
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.120]   we really could--
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.120]   Awesome.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.600]   Which is awesome in the one way.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600]   But also we're talking.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   I could talk.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   You don't like what I'm saying.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.360]   I don't care because I'll just keep talking.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.360]   Oh, see, he stopped.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   He's totally over.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360]   Before, it wasn't--
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   Is that to say because he was a light?
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   --like you were light.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.360]   Which was kind of better.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.560]   Well, yeah.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.560]   Google engineers.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.400]   So anyway, toyed with the idea of a Quang Zoom two years ago.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.360]   Oh, what was it then?
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.360]   I don't know.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.080]   They should-- that was the one that got away.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.680]   You bought Zoom in 2018.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.920]   That would have been a good deal.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.440]   Now I think it's too expensive.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:16.800]   So when the pandemic hit at school, they tried to get us all on Google Chat and nobody used
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   it.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   And we said, why would you use Slack?
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   We used Slack for classes.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   No, no, no.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.560]   No, nobody used it.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.080]   So now it's Slack.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   Yep.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.080]   Yep.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.920]   In fact, I was on Windows Weekly.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.880]   We were talking about what's the Google alternatives to Slack?
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   Is it meat?
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   Is it chat?
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   Is it Slack?
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.880]   There isn't that.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   Is it-- is it the hangouts?
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880]   Is it-- what is it?
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   And that's the--
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   Right.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.080]   In a nutshell, it's--
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.880]   Anything from a messaging standpoint is a mess.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.280]   It's completely unclear what they're up to.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.320]   Well, Slack isn't messaging.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.520]   Slack is a virtual--
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   Slack is--
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   Slack is--
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520]   I see.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.520]   Well, no, Slack is everything.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:29:00.640]   We use Slack for phone calls, for video calls, for messaging primarily.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:05.560]   Yeah, we used it as a-- I mean, we used it more like IRC.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   Right.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.360]   But it's changed too over time.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.360]   It's--
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.360]   It has now a lot.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   We still have our old giga-ohm Slack and every, like, now it's down to like once a month,
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.840]   you'll pop in and someone will have left a message.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.600]   For the year afterwards, we actually paid for it.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.320]   Because we were like, we want to hang out so much.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   Stay with each other.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   Is Om on it?
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   Oh, no.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   No.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   No.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   He's way too easy.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:37.960]   When Om was in our Slack chats, he would just come down like this cranky band and just
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   crush the conversation.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   Just be like, this is dull.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   [laughter]
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   We'd be like--
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.640]   And the thing is, he has such-- he has such-- carry such weight.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.440]   Everybody goes, okay, yeah, you're right.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   Okay, sorry.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   Never mind.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.440]   We were talking about that.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.440]   Yes, sir.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.440]   We mostly rolled our eyes.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.440]   But it was--
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   Okay.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.280]   That was his-- he thought, you know, we were wasting too much time.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.280]   That's our work.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.920]   You know, bonding his culture-- team culture remotely.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.080]   And he'd just be like, hmm, singing.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.800]   Honestly, that's what's wrong with Slack, if you ask me.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.440]   It's really too much fun.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.560]   And it really isn't about getting worked, and it's more about socializing and hanging
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.560]   out.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.560]   And I'm the cranky.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.520]   I'm the Om guy, right?
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.560]   I go into our Slack and say-- I did this.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.680]   We have a general channel, or I think it was general.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.120]   I said, no more animated GIFs in the general channel.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.120]   I can't figure out what the hell's going on here.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   Facts.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:37.760]   So we created a random channel that's full of-- there's nothing but animated GIFs.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.960]   Slack lends itself to kind of screwing around and screwing off, if yes.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.200]   Yeah, because at Fortune, we had Slack, and then we had Trello for, like, tracking stories.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.200]   Right.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.200]   And that was useful.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:59.440]   But I will say, as someone who has been virtual since 2005, Slack is a godsend for someone
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.440]   who--
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.440]   Yes.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.280]   Like, I would never meet my coworkers for months.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.440]   No, it's great for working at home.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.440]   Absolutely.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:13.880]   Or for somebody like you, a distance worker from the old days.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   I think it's--
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   Lisa's a side--
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.600]   would you downsize your offices?
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.600]   We can't.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.880]   Yeah, if I didn't have the lease, are you kidding?
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.840]   That's what we said, Lisa's not.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   We're stuck here, five years.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.120]   I bet you were asking him to do Lisa.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.120]   I know.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.120]   That's what I thought, too.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.400]   When you met-- you didn't mean my wife.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.360]   You met our leases.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   Lisa's a side.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.480]   No, we don't need this.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.800]   There's two people in the office.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   Right.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.120]   Most of the time.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.880]   There's really no reason for all this acreage.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.680]   And this is my point, is that you say all the vaccine and everything's going to go back
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   to the way it was.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   I don't think so.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.560]   I think companies have learned we don't need to do this.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.720]   This is working perfectly fine.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.040]   We were crazy to rent a studio.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.760]   I could do this out of the house.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.000]   I don't need all this.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.120]   I think that's true for some things.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:14.600]   There are a lot of pitch meetings and things like that that won't have to take place anymore
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:20.760]   over lunch or anything like that, because you can all do it virtually.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:27.720]   And yes, I'm an employee, but I still think there's a place for the studio or any studio.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.520]   Well, it's the energy and the actual final output of the product.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.840]   And let's not forget birthday cakes.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.480]   And cakes, everything you and me at, you like people.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.520]   And so, no, I'd say that.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.280]   No, no, no, no.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.640]   Honestly, I'm happy at home.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   I don't need to come in.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   Me too.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.000]   This is my happy place, my domain.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.120]   Yes, I love coming into the studio.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.200]   And notice, like mistakes, I've worked from home for many years.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.400]   And I know it's comforting and unproductive.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.840]   Actually, that's why we have a studio.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.920]   Because when I first started doing the radio show remotely, I tried it at the house.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.400]   And my energy level was terrible because I would slob out of bed and slip slide into
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.880]   my slippers into the studio.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.600]   It's time for the tech guy show.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.800]   And I realized I need a place to go to work to get up for the show to kind of like make
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.960]   this distinction between people or like that.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.120]   Yeah, totally get that.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.040]   And notice some people are like that.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.760]   I'm not like that way.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:32.880]   Fortunately, I've had the ability to have a room or a corner that's dedicated to work
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.360]   and getting things done.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:41.000]   And I also practice actually getting up, getting dressed and going to said corner of
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.600]   the house or whatever to do what I needed to do.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.600]   But I know there's a lot of people that just can't do that.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.920]   I've honestly think that there's two different kinds of people.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.160]   I've got to go to the corner.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.560]   I do think that there's some people who as soon as we open the offices will go, "Yeah!"
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:00.000]   And come running in and there's some people who won't.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.560]   Notice though, Ant, I am still coming into the office to do the shows.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.560]   I do.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.240]   So I actually, maybe I'm misunderstanding my own feelings about this because I do come
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   to the office.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.120]   So you come in because you feel that's where you need to be.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.640]   I think it's that the shows are better.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.400]   You just care about the product that you put out.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   I think the shows are better.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.360]   And it's not merely the wearing your slippers to work thing.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.640]   I just think it's better if we at least do some of the stuff out of the studio as much
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   as we can out of the studio.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.320]   And I don't like it when I see...
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.960]   Because you're paying for the damn thing.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.480]   Well, that's the other problem.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   I don't...
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.480]   Oh, you understand?
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.640]   I don't like it when I see all Skype shows.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.200]   I feel like it's better if it's anchored by somebody in the studio somehow.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   It's in my mind.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   It just seems like that.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.600]   And the same thing even on watching the news channels.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.240]   When Anderson Cooper was coming out of his house interviewing people over Skype, it just
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.880]   felt a little amateurish.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:02.160]   And yet when he was in a studio and everybody else is on Skype, it's fire, Zoom or whatever,
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.160]   it's fine.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   Actually, that's interesting.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   I think that's what they're doing.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:10.880]   Do you remember on MSNBC, Rachel Maddow was quarantining and she was doing it from her
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   barn.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.400]   It looked like it was very weird.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.400]   I did.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.240]   It wasn't great.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.080]   And I think what they do honestly is a lot of these people are in their house, but they
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.320]   just put a green screen up in a background to make it look like they're on set.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.320]   And that's all it needs.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.320]   But there is some psychological thing.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.320]   A lot of that has been.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.600]   I think Nicole Wallace is still at home.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.320]   But they make it look like it's not.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.000]   And if you have a good camera, good lighting and a good microphone, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.040]   You see, I kind of liked it when you can see this is room raider.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.520]   I love seeing people's books show.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.080]   And I like seeing the stars that way.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.080]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.680]   The roads today, major points.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.520]   He had Christmas decorations on the bookshelf behind.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.520]   Oh boy.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.520]   New competition.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.160]   Should I decorate for Christmas behind me?
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.520]   Oh, yes, Stacy.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.520]   Yes.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.520]   Yes.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.520]   Oh, yo.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.520]   Yes, Stacy.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.400]   Have we talked about Google yet?
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.720]   I feel like we should have some Google stories.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.520]   Oh, look at this.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   Look at this.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.600]   There you go.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.600]   Happy decorations.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.600]   Decorations.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   Happy now.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.600]   That is the.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.600]   It's just that those of you listening.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   I've never seen road schmoe just decked the halls.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   But did that take three seconds?
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   No, well sign in Garland, but he didn't unfurl.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   I got more.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.240]   I got more over here.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.680]   No, actually, so I don't let anybody come over on this side of the studio.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.600]   This is like a Cordol sanitary.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   It is a field there when you walk in.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.720]   You're literally bumping.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:55.360]   So I said, get the decorations out and I will decorate.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.720]   So it's on me.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.600]   And as you can see, I'm a real talent with the decoration.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.600]   Yep.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.600]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   We got Google.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   We got Microsoft.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.600]   We got commercials.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   We got lots to do.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.720]   We got stuff to do and Stacy's got to eat.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.720]   And actually I want to show you.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:18.440]   I know you talked about your remarkable, which is this new E-ink notepad, the second generation
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.440]   of the remarkable two.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.920]   I want to just say I got mine yesterday and I'm kind of liking it.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.880]   So I want to kind of give the, you're sending yours back, but I'm kind of liking it.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.160]   But we'll talk about it at pros and cons.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.960]   That's coming up to our show today brought to you by last pass boy.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.640]   I don't know where we would be if it weren't for last pass this year.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.640]   Thank you last pass.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.640]   And I mean that in a couple of ways.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.600]   First of course, of course they bought studio naming rights and they're advertising.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:48.520]   But also maybe much more importantly, we've got all our employees working at home.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.860]   And I am, I am, I feel so fortunate that we started using last pass enterprise some
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.080]   years ago because when the employees started going home and they, you know, they have, they
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:02.360]   have the logins to everything, our bank accounts, our websites, our databases, everything,
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.760]   our quick books, when they were going home, I wasn't worried because I knew we had last
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   pass.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.760]   We'd already had it set up.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.760]   They were used to it.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   They love it.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.640]   It really has protected us in this work from home environment.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.160]   Thank you last pass.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.280]   No matter where employees are working, I mean, companies are facing those cybersecurity threats.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.440]   But it seems like, I don't know, maybe psychological when they're working from home, it's just that
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.480]   much more risky.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.040]   And gosh, the last thing you want is a data loss or data breaches or ransomware.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.980]   You got to have a solid cybersecurity strategy, arguably even more so while employees are
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.720]   working from home.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.840]   Last pass, let's our IT team, our security team take back control of password security.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.480]   They can see what's going on from a central dashboard.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.760]   Businesses can customize admin privileges so that I love this feature.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.800]   You know, the people who run the business office, we have an admin, they should be able
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.840]   to control that, but that doesn't mean they should have administrative rights anywhere
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.840]   else.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:08.560]   The, you know, the ops, the engineering, the studio, the producers, all of them have exactly
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.760]   the right level of access to do their job, but no more, no less.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.960]   And one of the things last pass makes it really easy to do is to onboard new users, to sync
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.000]   groups to revoke access when that's needed.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.800]   You'll also get in your dashboard security scores.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:29.200]   So you know how your team is doing with their password hygiene, with shared accounts, you
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.040]   can monitor group memberships.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.720]   You even get dark web monitoring.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.440]   So you can see if your passwords are leaking out and you can let employees know and they're
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.520]   credentials are at risk.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.480]   Last pass uses the state of the art zero knowledge security model that that essentially means
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.120]   assume everybody is a threat and make sure authentication is in play everywhere.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.400]   And because they support multi factor authentication, geo location, an IP address in addition to
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.320]   fingerprint and face recognition, it's the best authentication standard out there.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.240]   Strong encryption algorithms.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.280]   All the data is only decrypted on device.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.360]   And by the way, every device you use supports last pass.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:15.440]   There's even 1200 single sign on apps and integrations.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.080]   And employees love that because they don't even have to enter a password.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.400]   They just click yes in their phone and they're in.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.320]   Don't wait till the year is up to get strong security.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.800]   Now's the time to invest in upgrading or adding security technologies to make remote work safer
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:36.680]   and more productive.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.680]   Last pass is the place to start.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.120]   Go to last pass.com slash twit.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.120]   Last pass dot com slash twit.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.720]   And thank you last pass so much for your support all year long.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:54.560]   It's been a great 2020 at least when it comes to last pass last pass dot com slash twit.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.560]   Okay boy.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.560]   Yeah, there are a lot of stories.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.560]   Amazon.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   We mentioned Amazon.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.920]   We talked about this on Sunday and this week in tech.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.720]   Amazon has gone in a massive hiring spree this year.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.760]   And I guess on the one hand, great, right?
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.200]   They're there.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   People are getting jobs.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:19.560]   But on the other hand, Amazon workers sponsored a Black Friday walkout.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:26.960]   There's a lot of, you know, people who feel like these aren't the best jobs, but 427,000
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.560]   employees in the last 10 months, massive growth.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:37.080]   I mean, they have 1.2 million employees compare that to something like a Walmart, which is,
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:45.000]   you know, significantly smaller last Walmart, which is the largest private employer in the
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.400]   United States has 230,000 employees.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.040]   Amazon has 2.2 million.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.040]   Okay.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.040]   Okay.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:01.040]   And most of those were added in the last couple of years.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.440]   It's this big New York Times study.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.440]   So you know what this says to me?
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.440]   What?
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:11.640]   Is that as much as we want to, like, emphasize how digital has changed everything and bits
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.560]   are, you know, bits are easier to move than atoms.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.360]   When you have the atoms, we still need people.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:23.160]   And, you know, as we talk about automation, as we talk about all of these other things,
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:29.120]   we really need to think about functionally how much can we offload to tech and boost
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   our productivity?
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:35.560]   Because right now we're boosting productivity by running people into the ground.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:43.720]   And I'm not going to call it wage theft, but you're not paying them, you know, Bezos,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:49.600]   he traded the $15 minimum wage for, you know, benefits for $15 minimum wage.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.280]   So we have to kind of think about that because a lot of times in tech world, we just, we
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   don't.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:00.560]   We don't think about the humans behind what we think of as digital, but they're still
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.560]   there.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.200]   Let me, by the way, I got the numbers all screwed up.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.400]   So let me fix this.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.880]   Walmart has 2.2 million.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.840]   They are bigger than Amazon with 1.2 million.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:16.000]   But the growth that Amazon has had this year is more than double the biggest year Walmart
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   ever had.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.160]   And that was decades ago.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:23.680]   So this growth at this rate, Amazon is pretty much eating the world.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.560]   And Amazon doesn't, you know, I'm old enough to remember when Amazon was going to have
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.280]   like two warehouses and that was it because it could avoid sales tax.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.440]   Yeah, that doesn't matter.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.480]   And now to Stacy's point, not only did you need the people Stacy, but you need the real
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.960]   estate near people so you can deliver it promptly.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.880]   And Karen Weiss, who's writing this article for the New York Times also points out it
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:49.600]   gives Amazon because they are in every state, suddenly gives them some political clout as
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.200]   well.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.280]   They employ a lot of people in every state.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   What are these jobs though?
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.040]   Are they good jobs?
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:04.520]   You know, this is a debate we have all the time.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:12.000]   Some people say it's the best job these people can get, but it's not a good job.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.600]   So we have to define and we have to think about what a good job is, right?
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.920]   Is a good job like we have good jobs, right?
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   We got great jobs.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:26.600]   A good job used to be like in manufacturing, which is the holy grail of good jobs used
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.280]   to be great because you could train someone on the job.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.360]   So you didn't have to come with like a college education.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.360]   So that's good.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.360]   More people can do it.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.080]   And then it was also a good job because you had employment for life and you had a pension
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.640]   or something associated with it, right?
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.560]   Yeah, it used to be a Ford worker had a great job.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   And let's not forget a lot of that was not because of Ford, but because of unions, the
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.560]   United Auto Workers.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   Right.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   Right.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:56.320]   So a good job pays well, has job security and also is something that a wide variety,
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.200]   you don't need a special skill set.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:04.000]   I think good jobs, like Amazon's jobs, a lot of them, you don't need the special skill
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.480]   set, but the job security and the way they treat you is terrible.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.760]   And we can get into the house and wise of how we got there on that.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.800]   But I wouldn't say it's because it's half a good job.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   By the way, the number of employees, 1.2 million does not include the nearly half a
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:27.880]   million delivery drivers who are contractors, not Amazon employees, half a million, nor
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.600]   they include the hundreds of thousands of good jobs.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.760]   Well, that's the question.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:39.520]   I mean, the thing that made, remember, Ford busted unions, hired Pinkertons to, you know,
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.520]   for the longest time, fought.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.200]   I thought hired Pinkertons.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.440]   I know, isn't that ironic?
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.960]   I think, you know, Pinkertons was still around.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   When I saw that, I thought, wow, that's interesting, but that's a different story.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.760]   They hired Pinkertons for a different reason.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   Yes.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   We'll get to that, actually.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.440]   It's a really interesting story.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:03.120]   But Ford was, you know, went kicking and screaming into a union, but I think you can argue that
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:09.480]   the UAW made a big difference for Ford workers on the lines.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.880]   And I don't think that the Amazon workers are getting those same kinds of protections.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   I don't know.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.400]   You know, Bezos is going to hire whoever he needs to hire to keep the union out.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:27.680]   Remember they were using technologies to kind of monitor for union organizing activity
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.800]   and all sorts of weird things.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.040]   They're hiring analysts to track union activity.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.440]   I mean, it's, I don't blame a man.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:41.080]   If you ever decided to say unionize, you'd be out.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.560]   Just don't get any ideas.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.560]   Okay.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.560]   That's like illegal.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.560]   I know.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.640]   I didn't say that.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.440]   I didn't say that.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.440]   I was joking.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.440]   You knew that.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.440]   Right.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   It is illegal, isn't it?
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   You can't then that's the funny thing.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.800]   If it had gone up right now and left to go on strike, that'd be funny.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   That's it.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   I'm a we're gone.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.440]   Oh, more panic.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.640]   Oh, Amazon has managed.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.480]   This is an article from October.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:15.040]   CNBC, Amazon has managed to keep unions out of its ranks since the company's founding,
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.840]   a recent string of events appear to show the extent of Amazon's efforts to avoid unions
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.440]   and track workplace unrest.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:29.200]   And of course, remember, they famously hired a guy for organizing and then attempted to
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.240]   smear his intelligence.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:36.280]   You know, so yeah, and it's not just Amazon.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.880]   It's Whole Foods too, right?
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.880]   So it's that conscious capitalism.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.680]   You nailed it.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.960]   Amazon posted a job listing according to CNBC for two intelligence analysts who could
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:57.200]   monitor labor organizing threats and report their findings to internal stakeholders up
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.920]   to an executive leadership.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.720]   They later deleted that listing and said, no, that was inaccurate.
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.720]   That was inaccurate.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:13.720]   We could meanwhile, they're giving $3,000 sign on, Boz, a $300 holiday bonuses and turkey
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.720]   cards.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.560]   I'm always, you know, I'm always have mixed feelings about this because if you're unemployed
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:27.040]   or underemployed, having a job is a blessing, especially right now, it's tough and maybe
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.680]   a bad job is better than no job.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   I don't know.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:36.480]   Well, it's that it's that thinking that keeps people in kind of this.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.480]   That ends.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:43.680]   Endentured state because, I mean, yes, even a bad job is better than no job, especially
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.480]   because you don't have any access to social services.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:51.600]   But we should be thinking, what are the types of jobs we want people to have?
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:58.320]   And even for Amazon, for people to be able to buy our products and use them, you know,
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.760]   we should be, I think you're building a market.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.440]   Anyway, I am like basically a socialist union driving person here.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.440]   So my.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.440]   Are you in a union?
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.440]   Are you?
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.080]   I have my own company.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.800]   So I guess I could be.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.320]   I'm in the union of one.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   I'm in the union.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.320]   I own this company.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:27.920]   So I'm obviously not a capitalist here, but in the radio show, I'm a SAG after and pay
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.840]   union dues and all of that.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   I like.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.840]   I like the union.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   I like the unions.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:33.840]   Are you a union guy?
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.800]   It's a story from an hour ago that says that Amazon's effort to thwart an Alabama union
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.560]   suffered early defeat at the NLRB.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   Uh huh.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:49.200]   Amazon was trying to delay a hearing on unionization votes, but they failed at that.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:55.800]   So and apparently they're according to NPR, they're using Pinkerton to surveil workers
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.600]   who try to form unions.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.560]   So Pinkerton, that's what they do.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.560]   We bust your unions.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.520]   You got strikes.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.360]   We come in and beat the heck out of those people.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.800]   Yeah, that's what happened.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:19.320]   Uh, in 1941, 400,000, I'm sorry, 40,000 forward workers conducted a 10 day sit down strike
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:28.680]   and Henry Ford brought in the Pinkertons and, uh, quelled the unrest in what they sometimes
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.080]   call the Ford massacre.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:39.600]   So I look at this stuff and maybe I think about it all wrong, but it makes me think back to
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.680]   one of the first corporate companies that I worked for and a conversation I had with
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:49.660]   a CEO and he says, Ant, the department you work in, you all work very hard and we're
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:54.460]   trying to put some things in place that's going to require you to do a little bit more
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:59.380]   brain power on your day to day tasks instead of being more like a machine and just hitting
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:03.380]   a button and watching the widgets go where it needs to go.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:08.460]   And some people took offense to that and some people was encouraged by that because they
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.660]   felt like, okay, well, maybe this is going to be a better opportunity to push me up in
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:13.660]   the country.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:19.900]   I'm in the company, but then also there were the people that took offense to it.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:26.580]   They realized, you know what, I can't do those higher, uh, more brain powerish jobs and things
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.580]   like that.
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:31.820]   For example, I will never ever be an application developer.
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.060]   I just can't.
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.060]   That's not in me.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.460]   I could probably do some other things.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:40.540]   I could probably do, uh, the, the QA stuff, which is what I used to do, but I'll never
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.020]   be a developer.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:47.380]   And I think these companies like Amazon, Google or whomever as long as they're giving people
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:53.460]   opportunities to try to do better and get more and earn more.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.460]   I think that's fine.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.020]   I just feel for the people that are struggling and feel like that, you know what, we're being
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:05.900]   screwed over by this company that's making the gazillion dollars off of our efforts.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:10.700]   But at the same time, I'm like, you know what, you can sit down and try to learn a new skill.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:16.820]   You can sit down and try to make yourself more of a important piece in the company and give
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.300]   yourself a little bit more value.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:23.380]   But that's just how I think some people think that's a bit of a jerk on my part, but that's
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:29.700]   just how I think there will be one of the biggest issues, like, you know, climate change,
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:32.740]   huge issue, breaking up tech, less of a huge issue.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:38.980]   But one of the biggest economic and people challenges ahead of us as a country is figuring
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:45.780]   out how to train and upscale workers because jobs change so quickly.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.940]   And like you said, Ant, someone can learn a new skill.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:54.380]   But I would argue some people can.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.300]   Some people don't have the time outside of work.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.020]   They don't have not the interest.
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:03.620]   They just don't have the mental bandwidth or maybe even the ability to learn a certain
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:04.620]   way.
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:08.020]   So I think that's why I said I would never be an application developer.
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:13.100]   I'm not a I don't think I'm a dumb dude or anything like that, but I know my limitations
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:17.780]   in telling me to sit down in front of an ID to figure out how to build some type of
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.660]   app for iOS or whatever.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.500]   It's not going to happen.
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.500]   What's an ID?
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.500]   See, I'm worse than you are.
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.580]   And integrated development and development.
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:28.500]   You see, you're ahead of me, Ant.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.100]   At least he knows what an ID is.
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.860]   Yeah, I think, you know, you hear for a while, I don't hear this anymore.
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.060]   There was this movement to get everybody coding.
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:39.220]   Obama said everybody should learn to code.
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:42.700]   And I, not everybody should learn to code.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:45.740]   Everything more than I should learn to do would work.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:51.700]   It's just there's just things that we there's all I don't know, but the modern world is
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.140]   gig focused, isn't it?
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.140]   It's not.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.220]   You don't get a job in a gold watch after 50 years in retirement anymore.
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.220]   Nope.
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:02.980]   It doesn't have to be gig focused, but you do have to provide.
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:07.620]   You can't just say like we are very in, especially the tech world, we're very focused
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:11.220]   on build your own job, right work to the job you want.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.220]   Right.
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:16.500]   Well, that requires a lot of hustle in bandwidth.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.980]   And I don't think people who don't have that for various reasons, maybe they're older,
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.980]   maybe they're tired, maybe they're caring for their elderly parents.
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.780]   Why, why, why you dissing me like that.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:28.780]   I know.
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:36.660]   But what is you have to both find a way to train people, incentivize them to want to
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:44.060]   be trained and pay them through that process, because what we have now is just like, you're
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.780]   just basically wagging your finger, go do this if you want to be successful.
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:48.780]   Right.
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:49.780]   And that's what do you tell your daughter?
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:54.420]   I mean, your goal, I'm sure with your daughter is to encourage her to find something that
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:58.540]   she loves that she should that she could succeed in and make it living it.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:01.780]   No, no, no, my, I want her to be happy.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.860]   And I want her to understand the trade offs that come with being happy from like being
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:10.780]   fulfilled in your work versus being, you know, wealthy or something like that.
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.460]   I'm just saying, well, but we all need to make a living.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.300]   And ideally you'd want to make a living doing something you enjoy.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:24.500]   So I think like she wants to be her, she wants to be a writer in her backup career right
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:25.660]   now as a poet.
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.660]   So we have to do that too.
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.300]   We have to level set a little here.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.300]   Let me talk to her.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.300]   Let me have a look.
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:40.060]   I think, but I do think there are plenty of people who actually like having a nine to
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:44.980]   five job that doesn't, doesn't fulfill them because they find other things fulfilling.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:53.460]   And our, our economy and the way we laud certain types of entrepreneurs really doesn't value
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:54.460]   that.
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.460]   Right.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.500]   So it's, it can be kind of hidden.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.620]   I, this is hard.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:05.180]   And I think we should have, we should make the tools available to people.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:11.140]   We should have, and we should, we should start setting an expectation.
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:15.620]   I do this with my daughter for continuous education in a way that means she's probably
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:19.140]   not going to have the same job for her entire life.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.900]   And I think that's really important to do.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:28.900]   I don't know how she's going to get from job A to job B to job C. I hope it's, it's
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:34.340]   planned as opposed to like, you know, you get fired and you're like, well, there's no
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.820]   more demand for this poetry writing stuff.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.020]   Or, well, I got to tell you Stacy.
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:42.420]   Um, well, so Stacy, I went to the Breadlow Friders conference one year.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.660]   I was privileged to get in there.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.300]   And if you walked around you and you met people, oh, I, I'm a fiction writer.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.820]   Oh, I went on fiction writer and, and you stood on a poet and you never really asked,
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.060]   Oh, and what do you do for a living?
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:53.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:57.420]   Cause there was no job there be had, but it's also Stacy.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.500]   I think it might be an open to opportunity that comes along.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.500]   Right.
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.380]   There were things that I wanted to do when I was young in my career, but I worked in,
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.900]   when I was in newspapers, they were highly structured.
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:11.020]   I am amazed by students when I tell them there used to be full time career long caption
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.020]   writers.
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:13.020]   That was your job.
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.500]   That's what you did is you wrote captions.
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:18.380]   You were expert at writing captions or you were a page layout person.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:23.700]   You knew how to read upside down and backwards or, or, or right there was a structure to these
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:26.780]   kinds of jobs and you had skills around them.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:32.620]   Now, whether it's gig or in a company, things change, those things change and the new opportunity
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:36.420]   comes up and you say, well, gee, if I can learn that real fast, the thing that it bases
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:41.380]   me about my son, Jake and about developers is, oh, we got a new language.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.700]   Oh, we got to worry about Ruby.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.700]   Okay.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.740]   Well, I'll, I'll, I'll play around with it and I'll look up stuff online and I'll learn
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.740]   it.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.740]   Right.
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:49.740]   I love coding.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:50.740]   But their job also lets them know.
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:55.620]   Not everybody loves it and, or is good at it or wants to do it.
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.580]   And for some people, maybe, maybe you're one of them.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:03.100]   If you had to sit down every day at a computer and write lines of code, you'd be in a living
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.100]   hell.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.100]   I would, I would too.
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:08.140]   Well, I, I'd be, I'd be a big in mud.
[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:10.020]   I'd be very happy.
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:16.580]   I did try because I enjoyed the, the, you like task that writing, you know, just trying
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:17.980]   to figure some things out.
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.420]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:26.100]   Which is why I still ended up dinking around with SQL in my, my previous job.
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:27.180]   That was all I did all day.
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:33.460]   I was able to stare at some source code to find a problem, but then my solution was involved
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.780]   in SQL, some, some fix in the database.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:42.020]   But just building the, the application or, or service from scratch.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.540]   No, I'm just not that talented.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:48.380]   You got to know what you like and what you're good at and what you, you, you, I give me,
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:53.460]   and I guess that's what we should teach our kids is to, to find something you love and
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:54.460]   you're good at.
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.460]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:56.460]   I don't know.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.460]   I don't know.
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:58.460]   I don't really don't know.
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.180]   I mean, I don't know what I think it's important to say.
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:03.540]   I'm a failed father because both my kids are screw ups.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:10.100]   No, Abby, what, Abby wanted to be a poet and it's very smart and very talented.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:14.020]   For a while she went to work in PR and what she learned is she hates sitting in an office
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:15.020]   at a computer.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:16.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.020]   It's not for her.
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.020]   She got a job at Trader Joe's.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.660]   Joe's, she's super happy.
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.220]   She loves that kind of work.
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.700]   And she's not making a huge amount of money.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.380]   She's making a minimum wage, but she loves it.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.180]   She's very happy there.
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:32.060]   And I wouldn't want to force her to do brain work if she doesn't want to do the brain
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.060]   work.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:41.820]   Henry got a degree in broadcast journalism despite my every warning that that was a terrible
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:46.660]   choice, but it's something he loves and he's trying to find his way doing that.
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:47.860]   It's hard.
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:49.900]   I realize how lucky I was.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:53.140]   I kind of stumbled into what I do and I've been very fortunate.
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:55.660]   Well, I think you should come to it.
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:59.740]   I just, you know, I was in college and I was a Chinese major and I thought, this is a dead
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:00.740]   end.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.740]   What was I wrong?
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.740]   Well, you're wrong.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:07.220]   Well, it would have been a dead end for me.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.620]   First of all, that was 1975.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:14.820]   But secondly, I would have been, I bored at tears sitting in the State Department or
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.820]   something like that.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.820]   It would have been boring probably.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:17.820]   I don't know.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.820]   I'm very happy.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.820]   It'd be pretty exciting now.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.060]   Yeah, it'd be more interesting now.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.220]   That's for sure.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:27.340]   But I went to the radio station, the campus radio station and that's, I really kind of
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.660]   fell in love with that.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:32.500]   And it's been very, I've been very fortunate that I've been able to continue to do that
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.660]   for, you know, all these years, almost 50 years.
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:42.580]   But I don't think I could, I could, I don't, this is the problem is my kids look at that
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.820]   and say, Oh, I want to do that.
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.820]   And it's like, I think I was just very fortunate.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.060]   It was very lucky for two of us.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.060]   Yeah, it'll pass to that.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.060]   The way that we're.
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.500]   There's no pass.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:57.780]   The way we do education for most of us, you're either vocational or you're like kind of humanities,
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.780]   right?
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.820]   And if you're vocational focused, you have to choose when you're 18, right?
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:02.820]   You think you're going to do.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:03.820]   Which is way too young.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.820]   That's crazy.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:13.660]   And if you, if you embrace the kind of creativity or the, the no plan plan and stumble upon what
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:20.300]   you do, I think our education needs to help provide those opportunities to stumble into
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.460]   things a little bit.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.980]   Just expose you to all of stuff.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:24.980]   A little bit more easily.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:31.380]   Because you don't want to think it helps if we, if we enhance the education system as
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:37.780]   parents or as mentors to these children and let them know, Hey, you're, you're trying to
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:42.140]   figure out what you want to do professionally at age 18.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:47.500]   You're going to change your mind 50 times between age 18 and 2021.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.660]   So just, just accept that.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.260]   I've been dealing with that with my boy.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.740]   He's a high school senior and he's been pretty consistent.
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:56.740]   I'll give him that.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.220]   He's been pretty consistent for us.
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:03.580]   What his goals are education wise, but I'm still just sort of nitpicking at him a little
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:04.580]   bit.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.340]   Say, Hey, you're going to change your mind at some point.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.340]   So don't be surprised.
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.780]   And it's okay if you do because you don't know squat right now.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:11.780]   Right.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.780]   And expose them.
[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:16.740]   You want them to have a chance to see every as many venues as they can to see if there's
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.900]   something they fall in love with.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:22.740]   I mean, I fell in love with radio at 20 and that was the right thing and I never stopped
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.740]   doing it.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.740]   Right.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:30.380]   I would have probably been an engineer had I had I been exposed to it in a good way or
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:34.940]   been had it been made accessible to me at that time, but I did.
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.340]   Is there a sexism issue?
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.340]   I don't know.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.860]   I mean, both my parents, my dad was an engineer.
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.780]   My mom was a geophysicist.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.900]   So they were both in technical fields.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:53.780]   It's just a going to school to study engineering just seemed daunting.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.780]   School lets us down.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.580]   I feel like the school system doesn't really serve to do the.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.940]   I mean, it was only a hundred years ago.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:06.940]   You would just do whatever your, your father did or whatever your family apprenticed you
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:07.940]   to do.
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:12.020]   It wasn't like you had a big choice in the matter.
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.140]   And there really, and there weren't any choices.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:17.260]   The imperative was you had to make a, you had to make a living somehow.
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.260]   That's it.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.260]   Now we live in this weird.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.500]   You can't help this bill sign or that's what it brought down to.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:27.220]   We live in a weird world where there's this kind of expectation that you will find this
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:34.180]   magical thing and will turn a key and you'll have success and joy and happiness in life.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:38.500]   And I think that's letting a lot of people, young people down because I don't, but we
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.980]   haven't given them an alternative.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.260]   Remember the book, What Colors Your Parachute?
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.260]   Jeff, you remember that?
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.260]   My mom had that book.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.260]   It's real.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.260]   It's so, you're right.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:49.260]   It is serendipitous.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:53.180]   I arrived at Claremont men's college that was then called not called Claremont.
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.700]   I was going to go into law school and go into politics.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.740]   I had my old plan ahead of me.
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:01.620]   I get there and I said three more years at this?
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:02.620]   No.
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.020]   So what do I, what do I do?
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.020]   I panic, right?
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.460]   I was on the school newspaper.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.460]   Same thing.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.740]   So I like doing that.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:10.740]   Good move.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:13.740]   Bad move was that I left Claremont and went to Northwestern to go to journalism school.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.380]   That's going to sound funny for journalism teacher, but I teach graduate journalism
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.380]   school.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:21.260]   In undergrad, I wish I'd stuck with liberal arts.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.780]   However, I wouldn't have gotten the job opportunities I got because I was at McGill.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.940]   Oh, yeah, you're good.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.780]   I got hired for stuff and I got internships.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:34.860]   And so, yeah, we're at a point now where you commit your life too early before having
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.580]   the chance to discover things.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:40.900]   Well, I just think we should, that's why I think education is such an interesting issue
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:47.860]   because if you just think about it for a second, what if we had people like for 10 years do
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:53.380]   something and then we had a path for them to go back to school like for six months and
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:57.380]   train to do something else after they've experienced it?
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:04.020]   Or Peace Corps or, you know, there are, yeah, yeah, there's like after you make your first
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:10.020]   million and you've sold your tech company, maybe you go to AmeriCorps or you do AmeriCorps.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:15.580]   Honestly, I think we just really throw people to the wolves and just hope that they can
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.180]   figure it out.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:21.420]   And it is every single story is somewhat serendipitous, right?
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.220]   And sometimes that's okay too, sir.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.300]   Well, it's all we got right now.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.700]   It's a very odd world we live in.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:34.860]   Biologically, we're not prepared for this high tech world that we live in.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.860]   It's an interesting one.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.860]   First time I'm at time for the moral panic sign.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:39.860]   Now we're going to get back to that.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.860]   We're going to get back to Google and just a second.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.180]   In fact, I've got the change log to do.
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:45.260]   But first a word from my sponsor.
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:47.980]   I want to talk about bad data.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:53.900]   I want to talk particularly about bad data in your customer list.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.940]   Every year about 30% of customer data goes bad.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.460]   People move, phone numbers change.
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:03.420]   And then there's the whole problem of customer data that was bad to begin with.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:08.540]   Fumblefinger data entry, whether it's your customer service rep or your customer herself
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:13.820]   accidentally putting the wrong zip code or leaving out a phone number, things like that.
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:18.700]   Melissa solves these problems to make sure your data is accurate and current.
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.180]   And that gives you a couple of benefits.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.740]   One, you don't bother people who don't want to be bothered.
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:27.020]   Two, you get your information to the right people at the right time or products, whatever
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:30.020]   it is you're sending out to them.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:37.860]   And three, you're not wasting your money on sending information or products to people
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.500]   who don't want them.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:47.020]   And remember we had masks, our old fulfillment company, we offered Twit masks.
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.940]   And they ended up somewhere in the...
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.340]   In Gainesville, Florida, right?
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:56.660]   Somehow, this company, and I'm not going to name names, but got every order wrong.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:00.260]   They got the addresses right, I guess, but the city wrong or something.
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:05.700]   And we got a box a couple of months ago from the guy in Florida who got all of the Twit
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.700]   masks.
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.980]   And in that box were masks from many other companies.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.100]   This was a complete scrub.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:16.540]   We've changed fulfillment houses, by the way, since then.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.420]   But that's an example of how this can go wrong.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.860]   And it costs you money, costs you your reputation.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.820]   We had a lot of Twit listeners, I felt terrible, who said, "I ordered a mask.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:25.820]   They took my money.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.820]   I never got one."
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.180]   No, I'm sorry, Joe in Florida got your mask.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.260]   I'm sorry, we'll give you your money back.
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:37.300]   That company lost a customer, us, because they weren't using Melissa.
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:42.540]   Melissa started doing this a long time ago, 35 years ago, for zip codes.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:47.660]   Now they can verify addresses for 240 plus countries.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:52.380]   They can add demographic information like property and mortgage data, marital status,
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:53.980]   social media handles.
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:57.780]   They can make sure that the address is correct, that the phone number is correct.
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.740]   They can add emails.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.140]   It's really amazing.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.540]   And it can do it in a way that works for you.
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:04.820]   They've got an API.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:10.620]   So if you're building a customer service portal, build in Melissa, your reps will love it because
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.620]   they start typing in address and it just fills it.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:17.220]   In fact, you might have experienced that on another page, often back in provided by Melissa
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:20.100]   where you start typing the address and boom, it just fills in.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.500]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.900]   You can use Melissa on-prem.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.740]   You can use it as a web service.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.100]   They have a secure FTP processing site.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:31.540]   So if you've got, I don't know, a holiday card list you want to check, upload it to them.
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.340]   They'll clean it and send it back to you.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:35.140]   You can do it software as a service.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.260]   Just choose the way that meets your business needs.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:41.140]   One thing though, you can be sure, no matter how you use Melissa, they are safe.
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.140]   They are secure.
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:43.140]   They are private.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:47.620]   They continually undergo independent security audits to reinforce their commitment to data
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.940]   security, privacy and compliance.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:54.340]   They have the utmost dedication to your data security, implementing strong controls and
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:09:00.580]   safeguards, their SOC2 compliant, HIPAA compliant, GDPR compliant.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:05.260]   No wonder over 10,000 businesses trust the address experts at Melissa.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:10.100]   Now is the time with the holiday season approaching to take control of your customer data.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.620]   Trust Melissa to be your foundation for data-driven success.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:18.100]   And by the way, Melissa is supporting communities and qualifying essential workers during COVID-19.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.980]   If your organization qualifies, you'll get six months of free service.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.940]   You can apply online, Melissa.com/twit.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:25.940]   Thank you.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:27.300]   That's a really cool thing to do, Melissa.
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:30.500]   Don't put up with sour customer contact data.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.740]   Trimalist is APIs in their developer portal.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:38.380]   It's easy to log on, sign up and start playing in the sandbox 24/7.
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:40.980]   And this is a little thank you.
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:46.820]   It's easy to get started right now with 1,000 records cleaned for free.

[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.540]   I love it.
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:53.020]   It says, "Welcome to it army to the developer portal."
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.020]   I love it.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:56.060]   Melissa, come on army.
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.340]   Assemble, visit Melissa.com/twit.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.980]   We thank Melissa so much for supporting us.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:05.060]   We thank you for supporting this week in Google by using that special address that way.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:12.060]   I know you saw it here.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.060]   Melissa.com/twit.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.060]   Really great, really great service.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.060]   I think it'd be good to do the changelog.
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:24.060]   Since you want some Google, Stacy, let's do some Google.
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:28.060]   Let's play the Google changelog game.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.060]   Whoops.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.060]   Oh, it's time.
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:36.060]   Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:39.060]   The Google changelog.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.060]   It's here somewhere.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.060]   It's here to go.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:45.060]   Oh, he hit it again.
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.060]   I love John.
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.620]   How long have you...
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:51.060]   John has been with us more than a decade.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.620]   13 years, 12 years.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.620]   Here's an example.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.620]   Perfect example.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.420]   He started in 2009.
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.340]   You were an IT guy, right?
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:05.060]   Working at an LA, Cal State LA.
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.060]   Retired.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.060]   Retired.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.220]   He's got a pension and everything.
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.220]   Retired.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.900]   You like doing IT?
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.900]   But for some reason, he didn't want to take it easy.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.620]   He said, "Some reason he didn't want to take it easy."
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.020]   So he said, "I like Twit.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.580]   I'm moving up a move next door."
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.580]   We didn't have a job.
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:22.580]   Geez.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.580]   We had just started.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.740]   We didn't have a job for him.
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:25.740]   We moved next door.
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.740]   Lisa said, "You know, he actually would come by on the weekends."
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:29.740]   Just hang out.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:33.740]   Lisa said, "We only give this guy a job."
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:38.620]   And I think at first you were just getting my salad and welcoming visitors and stuff like
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.460]   that.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:43.380]   Worked his way up to probably our most important employee at this point.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.820]   He manages the whole studio in D.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.340]   He goes on a strike.
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:48.340]   You are screwed.
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.340]   No.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.420]   If he wants a union, he gets a union.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:52.940]   Whatever you want, John.
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:53.940]   Whatever you need.
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.940]   No, he's a regular lawyer.
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:56.940]   He wants the union.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:57.940]   He can have a union.
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:59.220]   He can have y'all in his union.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:01.220]   I don't care.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.300]   Y'all join the union.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.300]   That's fine with me.
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:06.100]   I was like, "I don't know if we need a union.
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.700]   We're not employees."
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:08.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:09.700]   You can't have it.
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:10.700]   Yeah, because you're contract employees.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.700]   You're a contractor.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.940]   Stacy, you could at least get a lunch break then.
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:15.940]   That's true.
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:16.940]   Poor Stacy.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:20.620]   I feel that if I want a lunch break, I will take the lunch break.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.180]   Take my gosh, darling.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.180]   Lunch break.
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.500]   You just try to stop me.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.260]   Actually, this is a scooter X's change log.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:32.900]   I'm going to just from now on scooter X, he's our chat mod, one of our chat mods.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:34.660]   I'm just going to let you pick all the stories.
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:44.620]   Google Authenticator for iOS gets a dark theme redesign and bulk two factor account transfers.
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:46.140]   I don't know what both.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:47.140]   Oh, finally.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.140]   Does that mean it saves them?
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:49.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:50.140]   You could transfer accounts.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.140]   I think it means, yeah, you can transfer them.
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:52.140]   Too new.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.140]   To vice, yeah.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.580]   Yeah, because you never used authenticator.
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:00.380]   You always use Authy because authenticator whenever you switch your phone, you were like,
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.620]   "Ah."
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:05.420]   The new sharing transfer is done device to device.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:07.500]   No data goes to Google's servers.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.700]   That actually is preferable because Authy, you do upload it to Authy.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:14.420]   They keep it, it's encrypted, but they keep it there and you download it to new phones.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:20.700]   Google actually, you put one phone next to the other and there's a QR code and it copies
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.700]   it over.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:22.700]   I didn't realize until late.
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:26.300]   But I don't want to switch one of my QR codes now.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.300]   Talk about...
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.460]   Well, no, you don't have to switch them.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:29.460]   It'll copy it over.
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:33.500]   Well, it's really copying is that secret number that is really what the source of all
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.180]   of this is, is a secret number.
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:38.780]   So Mr. Jarvis was saying...
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.780]   I had to realize that Coinbase got rid of Authy.
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.780]   Oh, really?
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.580]   And so I had to use Coinbase at ages.
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:45.580]   Oh, wow.
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.020]   Check and see how my Bitcoin's doing.
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:51.660]   I got a little few hundred bucks and I took days to get in because there's no Authy.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.740]   Oh, that sucks.
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.740]   It's all right.
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.860]   The more long you sit on Bitcoin, apparently the better.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:00.900]   Did you see it's almost $20,000 now.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.060]   It's at a new high.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.060]   19,000.
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.460]   Also close disclosure folks, I have $1,600 in Bitcoin.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.420]   Leo, did you ever get into your...
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:13.820]   No, I have $140,000 in Bitcoin, but I don't know what the password is.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.460]   I got a worst story.
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:21.020]   Actually, I always feel bad until I think about Steve Gibson, who when Bitcoin was in
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.860]   its infancy, he was talking about it.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:26.380]   He did a whole show on Bitcoin explaining because he loved the mathematics.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:27.460]   That was really cool.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:30.620]   And he said, "I'll put a Bitcoin miner on this old computer."
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:34.540]   The next morning he wakes up 50 Bitcoins coming out of the Bitcoin miner.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:38.420]   Now at the time, 50 was worth five bucks.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.540]   So he didn't pay much attention to it.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:45.940]   And in fact, that machine eventually got decommissioned and the hard drive erased.
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:50.540]   That would have been $1 million today.
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:53.020]   So I don't feel bad.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.820]   I still have my Bitcoin.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:56.820]   I just...
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:57.820]   It's all kind of...
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:58.820]   That's kind of like the new...
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:14:59.820]   It's a foreign trend.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:00.820]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:02.820]   Whew.
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:03.820]   Well, and that's what I do.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.660]   Is it a wallet you can't access?
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:06.660]   I know.
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.380]   He brought it up the other day and I said, "Look, Steve, you probably would have sold
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.940]   them by now when it got to $500."
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:12.940]   He was like, "Oh, great.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:13.940]   I'll cash in."
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:14.940]   That's the problem with this stuff.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.340]   You never know.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.220]   You know, when do I cash in?
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:20.020]   How do I know?
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:24.260]   Google Health has a new tool that helps you plan medical visits.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:28.740]   It's going to roll out to search.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:29.740]   This is...
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:32.980]   You remember they added a COVID-19 alert earlier this year.
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:36.980]   They're now piloting a general tool to help you plan visits.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:43.220]   It's worked with HHS and the HHS Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:46.220]   It's essentially a checklist.
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:48.100]   So here's some examples.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:51.020]   Step one, get started planning for an upcoming visit.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.380]   Step two, build your checklist.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.020]   What do you want to ask?
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:58.580]   So kind of planning for your doctor's visit.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:59.580]   Step three, we're...
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.220]   How do I do this with my daughter before her well visit?
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.220]   There you go.
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:04.300]   Now Google could take over.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:08.380]   Mother Google, remember to bring the names and amounts of any medications, your insurance
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:09.380]   card, any of them.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:10.380]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:13.820]   It's a health planner.
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:17.020]   The suggested questions were developed by the HHS.
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:20.460]   As part of its questions are the answer initiative.
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:23.820]   Not yet everywhere it'll roll out more over time.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:30.220]   So when you do health-related searches or in search or maps, you'll see at the bottom,
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.820]   start a checklist.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:40.420]   But you can also go right now directly to it by going to health.google.com/visitapplan.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.420]   It's kind of rudimentary.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:46.220]   Let's be honest, right?
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:47.220]   It's not like...
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:51.540]   I mean, it's this is the kind of thing you teach your daughter, but you're not...
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.540]   You don't...
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:54.540]   I don't know.
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.540]   Google's the last person I think.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.180]   I listen to that stuff.
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.180]   Yeah.
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:03.180]   Let's see.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:04.340]   Boy, there's a whole lot of...
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:10.260]   Google is pulling the plug on something you probably love.
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:13.820]   It's 3D model sharing website, Poly.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.340]   I never even heard of it.
[01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.340]   That's why.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.340]   Pulling the plug.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.980]   Launched in November 2017.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:29.580]   I guess if you're into 3D models, they're going to shut it down June 30, 2021.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.580]   But you can...

[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:39.700]   What do you think of that?
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:40.700]   There's a Breville.
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:41.700]   There's the Breville Nespresso.
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:42.940]   That's not isn't this.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:43.940]   That's an espresso.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.060]   So Stacy, what do you think of the ninja foodie?
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.340]   Is that a good choice?
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:49.340]   I mean, I'm not in.
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:51.060]   I've got my own air fry oven already.
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:53.060]   And I don't air fry.
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:54.420]   I put this in number one.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:57.460]   If you don't have a stand mixer, get one.
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.660]   How do you make cookies without a stand mixer?
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:03.740]   I don't think you need a stand mixer, but we have one because my daughter is so into
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:04.740]   it.
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:10.580]   My mom gave her hers, but I personally think this is like the most yuppafied present that's
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:11.580]   out there.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:12.820]   Oh, no, get a KitchenAid.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:16.620]   And look, I still have the KitchenAid I got in 1981.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:19.140]   Oh, no, it's a great product.
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:20.340]   It will never break.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:22.340]   And you can repair it.
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:27.260]   But I'm just saying, like I even made like alofa bread every week just using my queasant
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.260]   art hand mixer.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.260]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:33.740]   So don't be a don't be the anti KitchenAid person.
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:34.740]   This is good.
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.380]   Actually, you don't have to get this one.
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:40.060]   This is one of them, but you can get this expensive one.
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:41.060]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:42.060]   We have the professional grade one.
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:45.100]   That thing sounds like a jet engine and through stuff.
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.460]   You can attach a pasta maker to it.
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:48.460]   It's great.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.660]   You can attach a spiralizer to it.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.140]   I have all the attachments.
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.140]   I love it.
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:59.580]   Regular mouth mason jars, chakutta rebords, a kurig, the ninja air fryer.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:00.580]   We have one of those.
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:02.220]   That's what people in air frying.
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:04.420]   There's like four air fryers on here.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.420]   You guys.
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:07.420]   Crock pot.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.420]   Oh, just look at you.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:09.420]   You're approved, Stacy.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:13.980]   No, I'm just like, there's a lot of air frying, which is a really specific way.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:16.780]   Air frying is the insta pot of 2020.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:21.260]   Look, crusade round Dutch oven, highly recommended.
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.260]   I endorse that.
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.260]   I endorse it.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:27.820]   It's all I make my spaghetti sauce in 30 court turkey fryers.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.060]   Do not get a 30 court turkey fryer.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:33.140]   I feel like that's got to be like ahead of Thanksgiving.
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:34.940]   People were like, well, what else are we going to do?
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.500]   So these are all based on searches.
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.460]   This is not curated.
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:41.300]   This is just people what people looked for.
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:46.700]   This is the thing you will use one here and then we'll spend way too much time trying
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.700]   to figure out where to put it.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:51.300]   It's like, don't get a giant.
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:54.020]   Well, I guess it goes on fire or so easily.
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.020]   Oh my God.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:56.260]   I know.
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.420]   How about a cotton candy maker?
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:26:59.420]   Really?
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:00.420]   Really?
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:01.820]   You want a cotton candy maker?
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:03.820]   Yeah, that's not a healthy thing.
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:08.740]   That's not healthy, but that's also a nice big dopamine hit for people just trying to
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:09.740]   feel good.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:10.740]   Okay.
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:11.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:12.740]   Sure.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:13.740]   Hop yourself and your kids up on sugar.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:14.740]   See how you feel like screw-allers.
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:15.740]   I scream cotton candy.
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:18.180]   That's just, that's just quick comfort food.
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.980]   Got kids stuff.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.460]   Look at this.
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:24.460]   Fat brain simple dimple.
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:26.540]   Everybody should have a fat brain simple dimple.
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:31.980]   Whatever the hell that is.
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.500]   Harry Potter mystery one.
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.860]   The mystery is why he spent so much for it.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:37.340]   How about a Barbie dream house?
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.340]   That's still good.
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.340]   Hot wheels, city.
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:40.340]   Everybody needs to go.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.340]   Everybody needs to go.
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:43.340]   These are good.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.340]   You know what?
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:45.340]   Okay.
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:46.340]   I'm just going to say real quickly.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:49.340]   Go to www.beadaholique.com/
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.340]   International Space Station?
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.700]   No, slash adults.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:58.060]   Lego now has adult models for Lego.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:01.060]   And oh, God, look at the size of that cookie announcement.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:03.060]   That's freaking nuts.
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.060]   What am I?
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:05.060]   You're European.
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:06.980]   They really want you to know.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:08.340]   Except cookies.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.820]   I accept them.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:10.820]   Look at this.
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:11.820]   Look at this.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:12.820]   That's a Lego model.
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:13.820]   What the hell is it?
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:14.820]   No one knows.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.700]   That's the Empire State Building.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:17.700]   This week we should give you...
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.700]   I'm going to make my Gutenberg press.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.700]   A Gutenberg press.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.700]   I've given people the Lego architecture.
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:23.700]   Oh, the Dakot.
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:24.700]   Look at that.
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:25.700]   Look at that.
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.700]   Yeah, these are amazing.
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:28.060]   These are for adults.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.060]   Look at this.
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.060]   The ISS.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.060]   That's the station.
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:32.060]   Yes.
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:33.060]   Look at that.
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:34.060]   International Space Station.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:35.380]   But this is my favorite.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.700]   You can get...
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:40.260]   It's $120, but you only can make one beetle with it.
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:42.060]   But any one of the four.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:44.020]   I should get that for Kevin.
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:49.020]   Kevin would love this, but you got to buy all four, which means it's now $500 because...
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:50.500]   Five of them in a book.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:51.500]   You got it.
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:52.500]   I don't know his favorite beetle.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:53.500]   I'm only giving it.
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:54.500]   No, no, you don't have to choose the beetle.
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:59.220]   Oh, no, you buy the set and you can make anyone choose one picture, four options.
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.220]   That's great.
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.220]   He can redo it.
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:02.220]   Yeah, he can redo it.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.220]   And it probably is really a lot of work.
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:07.700]   That's okay.
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:10.020]   He gave me a build your own computer kit last year.
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:11.020]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.220]   I feel totally justified by him.
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:13.220]   For sure.
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:14.220]   It's a work.
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.220]   Actually, you know what?
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.220]   I just gave myself.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:17.220]   Get him.
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.500]   If you want to build your own, you can give this to your husband.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:26.220]   This is an Arduino-based Altair computer for $229.
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:27.940]   Oh, that's my husband?
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:29.180]   Yeah, I think he'd like.
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:30.180]   He'd appreciate it.
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.180]   Oh, it's out of stock.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.180]   I got the last one.
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:33.180]   Oh, wow.
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:35.620]   No, my husband does not do gadgets or computers.
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:37.540]   Yeah, you remember that, Jeff?
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:42.700]   This was the computer that got Bill Gates out of his Harvard dorm room.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.700]   And to start Microsoft.
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.460]   Well, look at the computer fairs in San Francisco.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.020]   There were still Altairs then.
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:50.060]   It's Altair.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.700]   There is some soldering required.
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:55.260]   Okay, so let's see.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:30:02.380]   That was our Google Game Plus gift guide plus a few that we threw in of our very own.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:07.180]   For the safety of everybody out there, I put up the Turkey Fryer Fire at 141.
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:09.180]   Yeah, don't do it.
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:10.180]   Don't do it.
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:12.980]   Don't throw a frozen Turkey into the fryer.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:17.100]   Anytime we mention frying turkeys, we should just say that your Turkey must be completely
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.860]   thought before you fry it or you will burn your house.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:22.100]   And dry, if possible, right?
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:23.100]   Dry.
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.380]   It doesn't matter if you burn your house down.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.380]   It doesn't matter.
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.060]   You're not eating that turkey.
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.620]   No, I know.
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:35.620]   Okay, is this a video that we want to show, Jeff, or are we going to be regret this?
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.620]   Just a demonstration.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:37.620]   It's very simple.
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:38.620]   Yeah, it's right.
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:39.620]   It's a demonstration.
[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.420]   They're actually, wait a minute.
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:42.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:43.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:44.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:45.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:46.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:54.460]   This is like a fake house and they're far, far away slowly lowering the Turkey in via
[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:55.460]   crane.
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:56.460]   I guess.
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:01.860]   And by the way, can I point out that's the Turkey Fryer Google is listed?
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:02.860]   This is it.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:03.860]   That's the one.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:04.860]   Let's see what happens.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:05.860]   Oh my God.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.860]   Oh my God.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:07.860]   Oh my God.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:08.860]   It was frozen.
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:12.260]   That was a holy cow.
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:13.260]   Yeah.
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:16.100]   Don't do that.
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:18.260]   What happened?
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:26.180]   That's the consumer consumer product safety company holiday cooking safety press conference.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:29.020]   This is just all the different things you can do wrong.
[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:31.420]   We go to a rabbit hole.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:39.300]   It's a bank band and don't leave a paper Turkey decoration on the stove because what's
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.300]   going to happen to that paper, Durky decoration.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.700]   And by the way, the Safeway bag right next to it.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.700]   You know what they're doing?
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.820]   They're trying to turn it up some more Joe.
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:50.420]   It's not catching on fire.
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:51.420]   Oh yeah.
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:52.420]   There you go.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:53.420]   Throw some grease on it.
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.740]   That's exactly what you wanted.
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:56.740]   That's good.
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:57.740]   Actually, I think it's probably just water.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:59.940]   You never put water on a grease fire, right?
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:02.820]   Oh, you know what you really don't want to do?
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:05.180]   Put flour on a grease fire.
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:06.180]   Okay.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:09.860]   Now a guy with gloves is blowing on it.
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.700]   Don't blow on it.
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.700]   Okay.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.460]   That was that's the video.
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:16.420]   Cook up safety this holiday season.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.740]   I hope you all enjoy it.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:18.740]   Oh my God.
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:20.740]   The humanity.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:26.780]   Oh, that's in a real porch.
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:29.580]   That did not go well.
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:33.860]   I like the caption liquid bubbling sound.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:35.100]   And there's a fire under the porch.
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:36.100]   Oh my God.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.140]   The whole house is going up.
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:39.500]   Geez Louise.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.820]   Do not take long.
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:43.740]   Yeah.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.500]   You know, whenever you're spraying on it, it's not putting it out.
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:49.940]   Yeah, no, stop doing whatever you're doing.
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:51.700]   You're spraying in accelerant.
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:55.060]   I think there's spraying gasoline on it.
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:56.740]   It's not.
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:58.900]   It's not good.
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.940]   After they're doing.
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:07.540]   I put a note in the chat room for everyone on why deep frying a turkey, a frozen turkey,
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:15.980]   is instant by flame, but is it because it's wet?
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:18.220]   It is because it's wet.
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.220]   Okay.
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.220]   Geez.
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.380]   Oh my God.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:24.500]   Wow.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:25.780]   Apparently William Shatner has one.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:26.780]   Okay.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:27.780]   Now I'm sorry.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:28.780]   But hold on.
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:29.780]   There we have.
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:30.780]   My fault.
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:31.780]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:32.780]   Your fault.
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:39.420]   But now that we're there, here's William Shatner, Captain Kirk on Turkey safety.
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.420]   Go ahead.
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:43.240]   It's called eat fry loves.
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:47.680]   I'm William Shatner and I love fried turkey.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:51.860]   So join my Friars Club.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:55.140]   Turkey and oil are a dangerous combination.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.020]   So watch this video.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.380]   I want your comments on it.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:01.340]   I want to know how you plan to keep yourself, the family.
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:04.740]   I think there's a lot of frying going on.
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:06.820]   I think I have a second.
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:11.700]   I still think the turkey is still burning elsewhere.
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:12.700]   I don't know what now.
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:16.580]   Why there's a garbage truck or I don't know what's going on.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:17.580]   I don't know.
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:18.580]   I've lost control.
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:19.580]   Yeah.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:20.580]   You know what?
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:21.580]   Sorry, folks.
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:22.580]   That was my fault.
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:26.020]   Cooking up safety this holiday season and that's the Google change lock.
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.380]   Look at that.
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:33.980]   What a pro John is such a pro.
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:37.820]   Of course Twitter has said and I don't know why they even had to announce this that Jan
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:46.220]   come January 20th 12 noon, the at POTUS account will go to the president who unless everything's
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:49.500]   gone horribly wrong is Donald Trump.
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.500]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:51.500]   I got that wrong.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:52.500]   It's perfect.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:53.500]   Wait, what?
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.980]   It's Joe Biden.
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:35:02.180]   But ladies and gentlemen, there's already a Twitter account for the first dogs at the
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:04.620]   first dogs.
[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:11.140]   And I'm not sure what this is because because major was the dog he was walking when he
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:13.380]   broke the bones in his foot.
[01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:20.140]   Oh, there's a picture of Biden in his boot and major says, see, he fine.
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:23.900]   Oh, they issued a press release, didn't they?
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:27.380]   Oh, yeah, go to the go to the go to the go to the account.
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.700]   Yeah, you're following go to the account, Leo, up to the account.
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:32.700]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:33.700]   I read Twitter.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:34.700]   Okay.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.700]   Now what?
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:40.900]   If you scroll down, you know what that you don't do that.
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:41.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:42.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:43.900]   You're going to see a press official.
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:44.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:50.900]   Probably should just do tweets instead of in Twitter tweets and replies because there's a
[01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:52.540]   lot of replies to this one.
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:53.540]   So keep going.
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:54.540]   Keep going.
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.540]   Keep going.
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.860]   Champ and major Biden.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.180]   Why do we give dogs our last name?
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:01.620]   It's not like we married him.
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.740]   What's the point of that?
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:05.300]   It's like, cause there are children.
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:06.700]   Oh, there are children.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.580]   Oh, here's the press release.
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:09.580]   Here's the pressure.
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:10.580]   Here it is.
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:13.180]   Statement from Caufer's dog elect major Biden.
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:17.220]   Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.220]   Translation from Doggo.
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.180]   I'm sorry you hurt your ankle.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:21.180]   Small fractures.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:22.180]   Serious.
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:23.180]   I'm still good boy.
[01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:24.180]   That's great.
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:25.180]   Isn't that great?
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:26.180]   That's great.
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:29.340]   You see, that's what socialism can bring this country.
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.340]   Yeah.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.340]   Humor.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:32.340]   Humor.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:33.340]   Yeah.
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.180]   Socialists got, got fun.
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:37.180]   That's hysterical.
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:38.180]   Isn't it?
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:39.180]   Yeah.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:40.180]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:43.660]   It's about time we had a dog in the, in the White House sort of.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.460]   And you know what else is happening?
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:46.460]   What else?
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:47.460]   The dog goes aren't happy.
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:48.460]   He's going to get a cap too.
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:49.460]   I saw that.
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:50.460]   Why?
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:51.460]   That's crazy.
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:52.460]   I don't know.
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:55.900]   He's trying to, he's trying to, you know, be the, be the president for all animals.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.900]   He's the Uniter.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:36:58.900]   Uniter.
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:00.620]   And dog people, cat people.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:04.380]   We have to stop the division in this country.
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:11.780]   And meanwhile, the current president, 50 days and counting, threatens to veto a major
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:16.700]   defense bill unless Congress repeals section 230.
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:23.260]   At this point, I presume people are just going to go, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.820]   How much power does he really have?
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:26.300]   Well, he's still the president.
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.820]   He could launch a nuclear attack.
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:32.140]   No, no, you're not spending on, yeah, I mean, Republicans who used to be, Hawks are now all
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:33.060]   doves apparently.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.260]   Because he has a war against Twitter.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.700]   Yeah.
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:41.940]   The very dangerous and unfair section 230 is not completely terminated.
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:47.220]   It is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:49.660]   Of course, that's where you should put that.
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.380]   Defend me against Twitter.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:57.180]   I will be forced to unequivocally veto the bill when sent to the, this is completely
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:59.940]   gratuitous, very beautiful resolute desk.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:00.940]   Okay.
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:01.940]   Wow.
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:04.300]   Was opposed to saying in the little kitty desk he was sitting in when he got in trouble
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:05.300]   on Thanksgiving.
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:06.300]   All right.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:08.300]   I shouldn't laugh.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.300]   All right.
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:16.100]   The chances of that happening, I would hope near nil.
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:19.700]   But who knows?
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.500]   That's what I would have assumed.
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:26.940]   If you ask, really isn't newsworthy because it just won't happen.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.100]   Well, it's newsworthy.
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:31.860]   If the president of the United States says I'm going to veto the National Defense Authorization
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:34.860]   bill, you do something for me.
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:37.980]   If you do something for me, I'll do something for you.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:39.980]   It's just a small favor.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.660]   It's a couple of years too.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:43.460]   So it's sort of like normal.
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:44.460]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:45.460]   Yeah.
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:48.980]   We need Microsoft surveillance on him.
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:49.980]   That's what we need.
[01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:52.020]   Did you say we're getting to that story?
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.020]   That's a wild story.
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:59.780]   But before we do that, this is Evan Greer's tweet of without section 230.
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.860]   This is what Twitter would look like.
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:02.940]   Thanks for submitting your tweet.
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:05.660]   Your tweet has been sent to our legal department for review.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:08.660]   This process usually takes five to seven business days.
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:12.460]   Please note the tweets with controversial opinions may take longer to review or may be
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:15.620]   rejected due to liability concerns.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.620]   That sounds like a joke.
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.620]   I don't think it's actually a...
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:22.060]   No, every newspaper is pretty true to me.
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:28.460]   We'd probably be shutting down the chat room and taking comments off of all of our pages
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:31.620]   and all that stuff.
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:35.180]   Also Evan has more has Wikipedia without section 230.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.980]   We're sorry due to ongoing litigation.
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:39.180]   This article currently is not available on Wikipedia.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:43.500]   As a reminder, because of the repeal of section 230, all new entries and edits are currently
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:48.700]   frozen to prevent our volunteer editors from facing criminal liability for editing posts.
[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:50.620]   We apologize for the inconvenience.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.620]   Yeah.
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:52.620]   Brilliant.
[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:55.620]   Thank you Evan.
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.580]   Brilliant.
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:05.980]   So Microsoft has added a feature to Microsoft Office that lets the boss monitor your productivity.
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:09.580]   Is that the story you were on to talk about?
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:10.580]   Oh, I wish...
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:14.900]   I mean, that's what I thought we were going to end up talking about just because it's
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:15.900]   not awesome.
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:16.900]   It's actually relevant.
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:18.700]   People will have opinions.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:26.020]   Microsoft Productivity Score allows managers to use Microsoft 365 to track employees'
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:27.020]   activity.
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:31.780]   So it does the amount of time that you have your camera on on Zoom.
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:35.500]   It does things like how quickly you respond to emails.
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:40.500]   And basically it sends all of that as a nice little data file to your boss.
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:46.020]   And your boss can elect to use that as like it's kind of like China's social score, right?
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:50.460]   And it depends on what you think, I mean what you do and what you think is productive
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.180]   and how you measure someone's job.
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:55.860]   But most people would probably say this freaking sucks.
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:56.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:57.860]   Because...
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:03.100]   Yeah, we've all had bosses who, you know, people like Omala or just complete kicks and
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:06.100]   no, we're kidding.
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:07.260]   Oh, it's wonderful.
[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:12.980]   Like Leola Port, for instance, who, you know, instead of actually managing you and, you
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:18.460]   know, trusting you and so forth, wants to keep a stink eye on you because he knows you're
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:20.940]   not working, especially if you're working from home.
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:26.420]   Now Microsoft in their defense, Jared Spataro, the Corporate Vice President for Microsoft
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:30.300]   365, said, "Let me be clear.
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:33.500]   Productivity score is not a work monitoring tool.
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.220]   Oh no.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:40.540]   Productivity score is about discovering new ways of working, providing your people with
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:44.060]   great collaboration and technology experiences."
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:45.060]   Okay.
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:52.940]   So what's the difference between this and companies doing what they call workforce management,
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:58.580]   where they are analyzing the amount of calls coming in during a specific time of year,
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:05.700]   time of day, the amount of email submissions and things like that.
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:10.020]   All of that is good data to figure out what type of workforce is needed for a particular
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.020]   time.
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.020]   Oh, that's different.
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:16.380]   Because then you're not looking at an individual, you're just seeing, do we need more people
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:19.300]   to handle this call volume, things like that.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:21.300]   But what if we...
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:25.700]   But the way this is to be used is to get some idea of how an individual, if an individual
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:26.700]   is productive.
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:29.100]   Jason, put in the change log in the last hour.
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:30.100]   Yeah, okay.
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.100]   Well, and it depends.
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:37.220]   I mean, like, you've certainly tied to their particular office 365 account, not just to
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:40.220]   go, okay, all right, I misunderstood.
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:46.740]   And depending on your job, you're going to have different metrics.
[01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:51.260]   Our job right now, we're not, I guess, having our camera turned on would be important.
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:52.820]   But responding to you.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:57.780]   I am monitoring everything you're doing right now, Stacey, and I'm not happy to do it.
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:42:58.780]   Exactly.
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:02.580]   But like, if my boss is like, hey, you're not responding to your emails fast enough, I
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:07.260]   might be like, well, dude, that's because I am participating in a virtual conference
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:12.260]   and writing a story about it and checking emails really disruptive in that process.
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:19.140]   The guy I work for who runs iHeart Media, Bob Pittman is legendary.
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:24.060]   Or if you don't respond to an email from him within an hour or two, and there are a lot
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:28.220]   of executives like this, that is a black mark on you.
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:31.180]   And so his executive team is up.
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:33.620]   They respond anytime that they are night.
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:36.620]   Email responses very quick.
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:38.460]   And I think- Is that fair?
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:39.460]   No.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:42.820]   Steve Jobs was like that too, right?
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:46.980]   He expected you to be working every hour of the day.
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:51.820]   And I don't know, you could say, well, look at the great results Steve Jobs produced, but
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:55.740]   I don't think it's a great experience for the employee.
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:44:00.860]   When I worked for the Robert Barron, Robert Maxwell, the directorly news in 1990, that's
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:04.580]   Glenn's Maxwell's father.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:10.940]   They issued all the top editors a brick phone, one of those huge old phones and a pager.
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:15.020]   And I remember I got in big trouble with him because I was in the Lincoln tunnel and
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:18.340]   it wasn't wired yet and I missed his call.
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:22.460]   And no, you were to call and whenever he called day or night 24 hours a day, you were to answer
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:23.460]   that phone.
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:26.980]   Yeah, there's a lot of bosses like that.
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:27.980]   Go ahead.
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:29.540]   Home was like that, really?
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.540]   Well, I mean- No.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:33.180]   Home was a great teddy bear.
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:34.180]   He was a teddy bear.
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:35.180]   Home is a lovely human being.
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:36.180]   Yeah.
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:38.180]   As a boss, sometimes he was- Demanding.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:39.180]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:41.860]   So I think a boss should be a little demanding.
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:43.460]   He's demanding of himself too.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:44.460]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:48.500]   He may have worked himself to a heart attack, not something I aspire to.
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:52.580]   So I guess what I- My feeling on this is there's just some really jerky bosses out there.
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:56.100]   We've all worked for somebody's a jerk, not only, but somebody's a jerk.
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:00.180]   And those people will use these kinds of tools to harass you effectively.
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:03.980]   And I don't think it's up to Microsoft to give people tools like that.
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:07.820]   But on the other hand, kind of that is their business.
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:11.980]   And so they're going to do stuff like that because there's demand for it.
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:12.980]   So-
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:15.620]   Unfortunately, but the company can decide whether to enable that behavior.
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:17.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:19.460]   I think it's enabling bad behavior, frankly.
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:20.460]   It is.
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:21.460]   It is.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:23.300]   It's nonsensical.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:28.260]   As Stacy says, you can't have criteria that are universal.
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.260]   Right.
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:30.260]   It makes no sense.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:31.260]   Right.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:33.300]   And you should judge someone based on their output.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:37.540]   And I mean- That's the first point.
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.300]   How they get to that point.
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:40.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:42.660]   How they get to that point.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:44.100]   You know, who cares?
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:49.700]   If I answer emails once a day, but I'm still producing good work that's insightful, then
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:52.500]   why would you want to change that about someone?
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:53.500]   You know?
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:46:00.460]   Hey, here's some Americans don't like government tracking of their cell phone activity.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:01.460]   That's really?
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.460]   Yeah.
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:04.900]   Oh, that was a great story.
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:08.940]   So the Wall Street Journal on the Friday after Thanksgiving, don't ask me why they chose
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.940]   that date.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:15.980]   Did an excellent story about people selling data or companies grabbing data from your
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:19.860]   applications and reselling it to the government?
[01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:23.580]   And that's a follow-on story from that, I believe.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:30.860]   77% of Americans believe government should have to get a warrant to get the kind of detailed
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:36.420]   location information that currently does not require a warrant.
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:41.180]   In fact, that cell carriers and others have portals for law enforcement that sell this
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:45.260]   at fairly low cost to any law enforcement agency that wants it.
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:46.820]   Where was Leo last night?
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:49.460]   It's right there based on your smartphone.
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.460]   Like Microsoft.
[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:52.460]   Yeah.
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:57.700]   Well, if you have these apps, so I think the key here is we need to guess government should
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:47:01.900]   have to get a warrant, but right now we're just leaking that data left and right because
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:05.620]   we're downloading apps and things and we don't check it.
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:11.100]   So we need to have some transparency and accountability, not just for the government, but for these
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:12.100]   app makers.
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:14.900]   The government's just using the loophole that we have.
[01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:20.740]   We need a data privacy act that actually has teeth and we don't.
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:22.420]   Why do we not have this yet?
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:30.660]   So it's interesting because in 2018, the Supreme Court said cell phone carriers, the law enforcement
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:35.860]   would need a warrant to compel cell phone carriers to turn it off a location.
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:38.380]   So, that's gone away, I guess.
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:43.460]   That old thing of you could buy it on a portal, but you nailed it, Stacey.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:46.620]   It doesn't apply to apps.
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:51.100]   So the Supreme Court hasn't addressed whether consumers can have any expectation of privacy
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:55.580]   or due process and data generated from apps other than from carriers.
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:58.300]   So the Supreme Court did prohibit that with carriers a couple of years ago.
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:00.100]   I did not know that.
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:05.060]   But the problem is this apps is data is constantly packaged up and sold to brokers and bought
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:08.020]   by law enforcement, according to Wall Street Journal.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:13.100]   Several U.S. law enforcement agencies are buying geo location data for criminal law enforcement
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:18.740]   and border security purposes and there's zero court oversight.
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.740]   People don't like that.
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:22.700]   The problem is I don't think people generally know.
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:26.220]   If you went and asked somebody, they'd probably say, "Oh, yeah, you need a warrant for that,
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:27.220]   right?"
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:33.660]   And you do, you do need a warrant or, yes, you actually do need a warrant to get information
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:36.740]   if you go directly to Google to get location information.
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:42.460]   But if you're savvy, you just say, "Oh, hey, let's see if this company has information
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:44.180]   on this particular person."
[01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:45.180]   What is it?
[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:50.460]   Was it called a pen warrant or pen register is what it was called, right?
[01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:57.980]   And I guess that that's no, I thought that was still a practice, but I guess maybe the
[01:48:57.980 --> 01:48:59.820]   Supreme Court has limited that.
[01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:02.180]   I did not realize that.
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:05.900]   So I guess this is where Denise Howell would be helpful.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:10.300]   You want to see the top TikTok videos of the year and then we'll take a break and wrap
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:11.300]   this thing up?
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:12.300]   Yeah.
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:16.860]   Celebrating the community and videos that brought joy across America.
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:21.380]   If there's no cranberry juice in Fleetwood Mac in this one, I just, oh, it's number one.
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:22.780]   Is this the rewind TikTok?
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:24.780]   Yeah, TikTok rewind.
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:27.900]   Yeah, YouTube was too depressing, but not TikTok.
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:30.660]   Yeah, YouTube's canceled theirs, but TikTok, nope.
[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:34.260]   Who had cranberry juice on their pandemic bingo card this year?
[01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:38.340]   2020, so on a astounding number of videos go viral, entertaining millions and changing
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:40.460]   the lives of creators who made them.
[01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:44.380]   These are the top 10 viral videos.
[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:45.380]   You ready?
[01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:54.460]   I had no idea.
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:56.100]   This was huge.
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.100]   That's it right there.
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:58.100]   That's all.
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:49:59.100]   That was the number one.
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.900]   That was Bella does M to the B Bella porch.
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:02.900]   Okay.
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:05.180]   Then the next one is number two.
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:07.700]   Yeah, that's the guy with the cranberry juice.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:08.940]   You don't want to play the music.
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:09.940]   You're getting trouble.
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:17.820]   What are you love to hate because working from home is hard by its.
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:20.860]   Oh, I saw this.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:21.860]   Yes.
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:23.780]   This is by is Caitlin.
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:24.780]   It's Caitlin.
[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:25.780]   Hello, you ready?
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:26.780]   It's Caitlin.
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:29.340]   I just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate your time and guidance during this
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.340]   time.
[01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:32.140]   You've been an amazing group leader.
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:38.900]   Yeah, to pick you back off of what Matt said, if you guys are struggling working from home,
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:39.900]   you're not being creative.
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:41.460]   I do a lot to do right now for the company.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:44.100]   I've been very, very busy giving myself projects.
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:46.740]   So you just need to be thinking about the company and be creative and have a positive
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:47.740]   mindset.
[01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:49.380]   You'll find something to do during this time and home.
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.380]   Oh my God.
[01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:51.380]   Oh, this one was perfect.
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:52.380]   Perfect.
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:53.380]   I have been with this person.
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:54.660]   Diane, I've noticed that Jeff is not here.
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.180]   He has not checked into the meeting.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:57.180]   I'm here.
[01:50:57.180 --> 01:50:58.180]   I love the.
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:50:59.180]   I love the.
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:00.180]   How do you feel you're going to bring that up?
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:01.180]   I actually made a PowerPoint on that exact topic.
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:02.180]   I emailed everyone the PowerPoint.
[01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:05.460]   If you guys want to check your emails, we should be always checking our emails.
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:09.300]   You can look at the PowerPoint so we don't have to ask questions during this time.
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:10.300]   I love the nod.
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:11.300]   The nod is.
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:12.300]   I love the nod.
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:13.300]   You're not watching it.
[01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:14.300]   The nod.
[01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:18.820]   That's the coworker you hate during a zoom meeting.
[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:21.460]   That's the number three viral video.
[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:22.460]   Should we do more?
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:23.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.700]   I don't think you missed Leo.
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:25.700]   We did.
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:26.700]   Oh, you did this.
[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:27.700]   Rata Tui.
[01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:30.900]   No, no, no, no, we did Rata Tui, the musical all on TikTok.
[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:31.900]   It was brilliant.
[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:32.900]   What?
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:33.900]   Yeah.
[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:34.900]   The whole thing.
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:35.900]   Let's only do two more.
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:36.900]   I do that to torture.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:37.900]   All right.
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:38.900]   All right.
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:43.180]   The NBA got one with a Jolya who shows us how it's done at the All-Star game.
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.180]   I remember that one.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:45.180]   That was pretty good.
[01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:51.180]   Will Smith wipes it down an obscure serial jingle that isn't bread, becomes a women.
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:54.100]   I got to watch this becomes a bread sensation.
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:58.300]   You can stop that.
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:52:03.300]   What language is this?
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:05.300]   Is it Spanish?
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:11.540]   It's a llama dancing to this and it's a serial commercial.
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:14.940]   But because it says me pan, people think it's about bread.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:23.860]   I thought I must have the weirdest sense of humor because none of that did anything.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:25.420]   I'm going to watch these at home.
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:30.580]   We played musical stuff last week in the privacy of my own home.
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:32.580]   They called him Alexander Hamilton.
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:33.580]   No?
[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:34.580]   No?
[01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:35.580]   No, you don't like that?
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:36.580]   No, don't do it.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:37.580]   No, he hates it.
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:38.580]   He hates it.
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:39.580]   This is how you can torture him.
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:40.580]   Okay.
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:42.580]   Hamilton would be great if he wasn't an musical.
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:43.580]   And then things.
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:44.580]   Let's do it.
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:45.580]   Then things.
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:49.860]   I showed it they brought to you by that hot stuff on the plate.
[01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:53.060]   The green ball, they call it wasabi, but that's not what it's brought to you by.
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.820]   It's hot, but not wasabi.
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.780]   Hot cloud storage.
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:57.940]   That's what you want.
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:58.940]   Hot cloud storage.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:03.540]   If you're in a company like ours that makes data, right, we make a lot of podcasts.
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:05.860]   You know, we're going to make a certain amount of data every month.
[01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:08.300]   We know we've got to save that data storage somewhere.
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:13.940]   If you're buying hard drives every month, terabytes of hard drives, stop the insanity
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:18.060]   you need wasabi wasabi hot cloud storage.
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:20.780]   Now, this is not your grandpa's cloud.
[01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:24.220]   This is not Amazon or Google or Microsoft cloud.
[01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:26.940]   It's 80% cheaper than Amazon's S3.
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:28.980]   One-fifth the cost.
[01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:34.540]   It's faster up to six times faster than Amazon S3.
[01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:39.340]   And I would argue it's better, more secure, more reliable than any on-prem storage.
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:41.340]   In fact, wasabi is so affordable.
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:46.300]   It costs less than the equivalent amount of just the maintenance fees for the equivalent
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.700]   amount of on-prem storage.
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:50.780]   It's less than the maintenance fees.
[01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:53.980]   Now, your boss, you're going to go to your boss and say, boss, look, I got to this great
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:54.980]   thing.
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:56.420]   It's a it's affordable flat rate.
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:58.620]   We know exactly what our budget is going to be.
[01:53:58.620 --> 01:53:59.620]   They'll save us money.
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:01.500]   And he's going to say, but it's not secure.
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.620]   You got those you got those hard drives in the corner.
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:04.620]   I know where they are.
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:05.620]   I know what's going on.
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:07.380]   I said, boss, those aren't secure.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:09.180]   You ever hear ransomware?
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:11.100]   You ever hear human error?
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:12.100]   Those aren't secure.
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:16.220]   Wasabi not only is more affordable, it's more secure than on-prem storage.
[01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:20.380]   First of all, 11 nines of durability wasabi has active integrity checking.
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:24.140]   Every object stored in wasabi is checked for integrity every 90 days.
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:29.340]   And because wasabi hosts and premier tier four data center facilities that are fully
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:34.260]   redundant and of course fully secure, if one bit goes south, well, they can get a copy
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:39.140]   from the other data center and you haven't lost a thing.
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:43.740]   By the way, secure by default, all the data on wasabi's cloud is encrypted at rest, even
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:44.980]   if you don't specify it.
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:46.140]   That's just automatic.
[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:50.260]   It's because they follow industry's best practice for security and design.
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:53.740]   They've access control mechanisms, bucket policies, ACLs.
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:58.100]   But the best thing of all, and this is a thing that you cannot promise with that on-prem
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:02.140]   in the corner, you got a hard drive in the corner and it's on the network and ransomware
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:05.100]   gets into your system, you're gone so.
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:08.100]   But if it's stored in wasabi, it's immutable.
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.100]   It cannot be altered.
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:10.100]   It cannot be erased.
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:14.900]   It cannot be changed by ransomware, by human error, by anything.
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:17.540]   You're protected from hackers' malware and yourself.
[01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:23.340]   It's the best way to archive data in the cloud better even than a local hard drive.
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:28.500]   It's of course HIPAA compliant and FINRA compliant and CJIS compliant.
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.260]   It's exactly what you're looking for.
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:34.820]   It is wasabi is a highly secure disruptive technology that's turning the industry on
[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:35.820]   its ear.
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:39.540]   Storage is 80% cheaper and up to six times faster.
[01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:42.580]   The only question is why you're not using it.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:43.660]   Calculate the savings for yourself.
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:46.660]   I know you're boss says, "Well, what about Amazon?"
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:51.540]   No, just say boss, this is less expensive, more secure.
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:52.540]   It's the best solution.
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:56.900]   By the way, if you know how much data you're going to use over any given time, there's
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:56:02.260]   a flat rate, but you could also pay as you go or you can also pay one time with reserved
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:08.060]   capacity storage because then you save even more.
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:11.180]   It makes buying cloud storage a natural addition to your on-prem storage.
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:14.900]   If you're thinking about buying more hardware storage, just compare the price against five
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:17.380]   years of reserved capacity storage.
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:18.500]   You know you're going to use it.
[01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:19.860]   You know you're going to need it.
[01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:20.860]   Book it ahead.
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:21.860]   You'll save.
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:26.420]   You could purchase in one, three or five year increments and you get of course bigger discounts
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:29.580]   for the longer you go and for the more capacity you buy.
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:32.100]   So it's even a better way to save.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:33.700]   I just think wasabi's a must.
[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:35.540]   Go to wasabi.com.
[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:36.540]   Try it today.
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:38.100]   W-A-S-A-B-I.
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:40.860]   It's Amazon S3 API compliant.
[01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:45.020]   So you already have stuff, you know, all the software you use on S3, it works.
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:47.020]   They never charge for API access.
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:50.220]   Oh, here's another big one that'll save you tons.
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:51.820]   You know, you store stuff in the cloud.
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:52.820]   It was fun.
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:53.820]   That was easy.
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:54.820]   It was cheap.
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:55.820]   But then you want it.
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:56.580]   They charge you not wasabi.
[01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:59.900]   There is never a fee for egress.
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:00.900]   No fee for egress.
[01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:03.340]   Another complicated S3 tiers either.
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:04.340]   Wasabi.com.
[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:05.340]   You could try it today.
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:06.740]   Do me a favor though if you do.

[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:12.740]   Calculate the savings for yourself and start a free trial of storage for a month.
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:13.740]   Join the movement.
[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:15.220]   Migrate your data to the cloud.
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:20.140]   W-A-S-A-B-I wasabi.com offer code TWIT.
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:25.740]   We thank wasabi so much for supporting this week in Google.
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:29.740]   Stacey, pick all the week.
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:32.580]   Oh, you're muted.
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:33.580]   Okay.
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:34.580]   Oh, there you go.
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:35.580]   No, I came back.
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:36.580]   She's back.
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:38.060]   Okay, I had to go get my sensor.
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:41.220]   This I did my gift guide last week on Friday.
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:42.460]   Oh, I missed it.
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:43.460]   Oh, nuts.
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:44.460]   Oh, it's on the web.
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:45.460]   Oh, nice.
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:52.980]   So the number one item, but I got to see how well it performed on my newsletter.
[01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:57.220]   And the number one item on the gift list that people were excited about is this guy right
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:57:58.220]   here.
[01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:01.180]   And this is the, this is a.
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:03.460]   Take that out of a plant.
[01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:06.140]   Yes, it is a plant sensor.
[01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:12.100]   So one of the themes of the gift guide was basically plants because I bought a lot of
[01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:15.740]   plants post COVID.
[01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:25.300]   So this particular sensor is the, on Amazon, it's the Oliveann OLLIVAN plant monitor.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:30.580]   You pop this into your plant and you download the flower care app.
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:38.180]   And what it does is it tells you the humidity, sorry, the moisture, the light, the fertility
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:44.020]   and the temperature of your house or the room and they, they have a database of all
[01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:45.300]   the plants.
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:50.380]   So you, and it's, you pop it in there, you tell it what kind of plant it's in and it'll
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:53.420]   basically give you the data about that plant.
[01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:55.820]   Does it tell you it's time to water it?
[01:58:55.820 --> 01:58:58.660]   Is that really that's because that's what I need.
[01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:01.340]   So here's the plus and minus here.
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:02.340]   This is cheap.
[01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:03.340]   It's 30 bucks.
[01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:04.340]   Right.
[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:05.500]   But it is only Bluetooth.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:08.660]   So you do have to check it yourself.
[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:14.540]   It's, well, in, so there's no Wi-Fi, if there were a Wi-Fi hub, it could actually tell
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:17.460]   the hub and then the hub would be like, what are we?
[01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:20.380]   So, you know, make it a point to go visit it.
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:24.380]   But if you're like me and I have, I have watering days.
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:29.740]   So every three days or so, I check and I'm like, Hey, does he, do you need water right
[01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:30.740]   now plant?
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:31.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:33.940]   Cause I, it's not under watering for me.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:36.020]   A lot of times it's over watering for me.
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.020]   So this would be useful.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:38.020]   Yeah.
[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:41.860]   So my plant journey has been, I over water and then I get fungal dance.
[01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:43.860]   I under water and I get spider mites.
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:44.860]   Right.
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:47.300]   And it's, it's just terrible.
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:48.660]   But this is helping.
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:49.980]   So I recommend this.
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:51.100]   It's a fun thing.
[01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:53.700]   Be careful though.
[01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:58.780]   I have seen this for sale on the US under the brand name Kale and that one is 99.
[01:59:58.780 --> 01:59:59.780]   Yeah.
[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:00.780]   Please don't pay that.
[02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:01.780]   Get the cheap Chinese.
[02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:03.180]   This is perfectly fine.
[02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:06.260]   And you also have, I mean, it's the exact same thing.
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:07.760]   Yeah.
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:12.260]   You have in your guide an argue, we know automatic smart plant watering kit, which will do the
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:13.260]   watering.
[02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:15.300]   So you have some other, you have some other solutions.
[02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:16.300]   Yes.
[02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:17.300]   Yeah.
[02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:19.140]   Ooh, that's my favorite thing that thing you see right there.
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:20.980]   Y'all the Meyer lemon tree.
[02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:21.980]   It's a light.
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:23.700]   It's a sunlight.
[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:29.940]   It is a full spectrum grow light that is attractive.
[02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:31.580]   If you see, I mean, that's pretty.
[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:33.140]   I mean, I mean, is it, is it enough?
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:36.780]   It's like to light your room like it could be one of your house lights.
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:37.780]   It is.
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:39.100]   We use it actually as a wall sconce.
[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:47.100]   We have two, one on each side and it's fantastic and it's made in somewhere outside of Pennsylvania
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:48.100]   or Philadelphia.
[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:49.100]   Sorry.
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:52.100]   So nobody's inside of Pennsylvania, but it's the same thing.
[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:53.100]   Yeah.
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:54.100]   Yeah.
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:55.100]   Close.
[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:56.100]   That's close.
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:57.100]   Yeah.
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:58.940]   You got a lot of this is a great gift guide.
[02:00:58.940 --> 02:00:59.940]   Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:00.940]   Oh, a whole bunch.
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:03.100]   Oh, that was my desk for everyone.
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:05.700]   Who was wondering about desks right there?
[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:06.700]   Yes.
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:09.340]   You guys spent a whole show on desks last week.
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:11.580]   Actually, just about three minutes.
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:12.580]   That's fine.
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:13.580]   Yeah.
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:16.340]   We talked more about Google on that show that we did on today's.
[02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:17.340]   Isn't that amazing?
[02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:19.500]   Isn't that amazing?
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:20.700]   You want Jason Howell back?
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:22.580]   He can be, he could be arranged.
[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:23.580]   It can be arranged.
[02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:24.580]   Or Jason.
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:25.580]   Wait a minute.
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:28.860]   I think I just heard Jason's tire squealing as he peeled out.
[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:32.020]   Now tell me.
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:33.220]   Does this work?
[02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:40.300]   This ember wave bracelet that says, so Kevin tried it and he had his wife try it and he
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:41.300]   does work.
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:42.300]   What?
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:45.780]   So the theory is it warms your wrist and then you feel warm?
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:52.140]   It apparently lowers your body temperature or raises your body temperature as needed.
[02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:53.140]   Yes.
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:54.140]   I.
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.140]   That's that's old news.
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.140]   Kevin.
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:59.220]   Kevin doesn't lie.
[02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:00.900]   Sometimes he sugarcoat things, but he doesn't.
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:03.060]   You know all about this ember ant?
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:04.500]   You've been here done that?
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:08.900]   Well, no, not necessarily that product, but it's fairly common for when you're trying
[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:13.860]   to cool someone off, you take cold icy rags or some other temples.
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:18.540]   You put it on your forehead or you put it on their wrist to help them cool off of their
[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:23.980]   fever because of the temperature of receptors and sending the signals to your brain.
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:26.820]   That's all that looks like to me.
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:29.060]   I'll just turn the heat up if you don't mind.
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:30.860]   Yeah, or that.
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:31.860]   All right.
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:38.780]   So the pick of the week from Stacey is the Olive and plant monitor $30 at Amazon except
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:43.780]   no substitutes, especially something with same thing for 90 bucks.
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:44.780]   That's good.
[02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:46.220]   Good, good, good.
[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:51.860]   A number of Mr. Jeff Jarvis, a number of the week.
[02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:53.660]   Which one?
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:54.660]   This is kind of a number.
[02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:55.660]   It's kind of a thing.
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:58.300]   So CAP-CHOP, which we're all tortured with?
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:02:59.300]   Yes.
[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:06.180]   Lawrence Edens' blog points out that it doesn't approve your human, it proves you're American.
[02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:07.540]   That's a good point.
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:11.300]   He fought face to CAP-CHOP that said, "Show us the taxis," right?
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:13.900]   Well where he's from, the taxis are black.
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:14.900]   Yeah.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:16.300]   These taxis are yellow.
[02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:17.900]   Yeah.
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:20.740]   So it's really culturally biased.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:21.740]   Very much so.
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:22.740]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:25.740]   So I'll make a quick one so Stacey can eat.
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:27.780]   That's very annoying.
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:31.980]   Mr. Ant, prove it.
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:39.220]   My pick is just something that I do far as helping with my sleep habits and patterns.
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:42.340]   I know y'all have heard me talk about how bad my sleep has been.
[02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:43.340]   Oh, me too.
[02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:44.340]   Over the years?
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:45.340]   Oh, man.
[02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:47.780]   Quite frankly, it's slowly getting better because I've been practicing some different
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:48.780]   things.
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:53.780]   And one of those things is I turn on an old audiobook that I've listened to in the past.
[02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:56.500]   Just to sort of help me wind down.
[02:03:56.500 --> 02:04:01.340]   And recently I've been listening to Bert Kreischer's book, Life of the Party.
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:09.540]   And it's such a funny, he's a funny comedian, but his story, his life story is hilarious.
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:13.580]   He was a college student for like six years at Florida State.
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:14.580]   Oh boy.
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:16.460]   Got a book deal.
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:21.860]   The college professor, I believe it was some literature or whatever, the professor went
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:28.340]   and passed him because he got a book deal and he didn't even deserve the book deal.
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:31.460]   So the professor was like, on principle, I'm not going to pass you.
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:34.180]   You're just going to go without those three credits.
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:39.060]   But he has a lot of funny stories and the audio book is the best way to go because he
[02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:42.700]   reads it himself and he's not very good at reading it.
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:48.180]   So he does a lot of stuttering and a lot of fun jokes and it dopes in between.
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:49.660]   I'm screwing this up.
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:51.180]   He's so hard at that.
[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:55.180]   You know, the best part of this is if you do go to Amazon and find Bert Kreischer's
[02:04:55.180 --> 02:05:01.380]   Life of the Party, it will then recommend a series of other equally wild books like
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:07.660]   Steve O's memoir, a professional idiot, Tom Segura's memoir, Thrilled in which he proposes
[02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:08.660]   like Michael Jackson.
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:10.620]   Oh, Tom Segura is hilarious.
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:12.620]   On the cover.
[02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:20.860]   Doug Stanhope's digging up mother, a love story and Kevin Smith silent, but deadly.
[02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:26.060]   So there's some really great literature here for you to choose from.
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:30.380]   Once you get once you start down the life of a party, stories of Rachel Mancher.
[02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:34.980]   There's no Gutenberg, but it's still a Gutenberg, but it's it's still good.
[02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:36.340]   Still good stuff.
[02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:40.540]   You know, we didn't mention and I probably should have mentioned because it's really
[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:44.140]   actually one of the most important stories of the week.
[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:51.940]   Have you many of our listeners who've done folding at home, the gene folding program that
[02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:57.660]   would run the background on your computer and help solve one of the most thorny problems
[02:05:57.660 --> 02:06:00.740]   in medicine.
[02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:07.540]   The issue of protein folding and how to predict how a protein is going to fold is apparently
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:15.980]   very important to making medicines and understanding how the world around us works and deep.
[02:06:15.980 --> 02:06:22.180]   What is it called deep thought deep space, deep something deep blue, deep mind, deep
[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:26.860]   mind has apparently solved it.
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:35.060]   I don't know what this means for things like folding at home, but this is a huge discovery.
[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:41.380]   And I really feel bad that I didn't I'll make it my pick of the week because this is a very
[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:42.380]   big deal.
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:46.780]   It was discovered by a London AI lab.
[02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:51.900]   Researchers at DeepMind say they've solved the protein folding problem, a task that bedeviled
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:57.940]   scientists for more than 50 years.
[02:06:57.940 --> 02:07:03.780]   Things make up everything, viruses, bacteria, all living things.
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:10.900]   And for biologists identifying the shape of a protein can bread can take months or years
[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:15.780]   or even decades of just trial and error experimentation.
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:22.660]   But now deep mind can do it in a few hours, maybe even in some cases, a few minutes.
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:25.500]   Deep mind is a lab owned by the same parent company as Google.
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:27.980]   Another one is alphabet.
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:30.460]   Its system is called alpha fold.
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:34.700]   It has effectively solved the protein folding problem.
[02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:39.820]   If you give it a string of amino acids, the system can rapidly and reliably predict its
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:42.420]   three dimensional shape.
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:44.900]   Huge breakthrough.
[02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:47.660]   And it's solved by artificial intelligence.
[02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:51.660]   So I thought, yeah, very important that we bring this one up because.
[02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:58.300]   The first vaccine took because of machine learning and data took two days to create and
[02:07:58.300 --> 02:07:59.620]   then nine months to approve.
[02:07:59.620 --> 02:08:03.020]   These mRNA vaccines are really innovative.
[02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:04.620]   It's a whole new way of making vaccines.
[02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:08.340]   This is also created by.
[02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:10.740]   So no moral panic people.
[02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:11.740]   Technology is good.
[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:12.740]   Could be very big.
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:14.580]   No moral panic here.
[02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:19.380]   Technology can be used for good, but if we should always question what else it could be
[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:20.380]   used for.
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:22.060]   And we ask those questions, Jeff.
[02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:23.420]   It is not moral panic.
[02:08:23.420 --> 02:08:25.300]   It is our ethical duty.
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:29.060]   We should also mention because we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, the Eris
[02:08:29.060 --> 02:08:35.940]   Sebo Observatory in Puerto Rico is now fully collapsed.
[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:40.940]   They were hoping to take it down before the collapse.
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:43.900]   It was severely damaged in a series of storms.
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:48.300]   And the hope was to get the towers down, which weighed many, many tons before they could
[02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:54.260]   collapse and hit the dish, but they have actually fallen and hit the dish when severely damaged.
[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:59.860]   So it's the end I'm sad to say for one of the most important radio telescopes in the
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:04.980]   world, the Eris Sebo Observatory, 57 years old.
[02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:06.980]   And this is another one we talked about folding at home.
[02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:08.380]   I remember setting it home.
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:10.460]   The search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
[02:09:10.460 --> 02:09:14.420]   It was being used for that among other things.
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:17.500]   You might have seen it in the movies or on TV.
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:18.940]   So pretty damaged.
[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:20.740]   That's sad.
[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:22.740]   That's bad news.
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:27.700]   I don't mind to end with bad news, but sometimes you have to.
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:32.780]   It is no well, which spelled backwards is Leon.
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:33.780]   Just saying.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:34.780]   Just saying.
[02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:37.540]   Today I learned today you learned something.
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:41.740]   You know, well, if I, you know, that's the thing when Christmas is over, I just get up
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:44.900]   and I just turn this around.
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:47.100]   He's going to turn it around.
[02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:49.860]   You know, it says Leon.
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:52.700]   So I'm just saying, no, actually it really doesn't.
[02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:53.700]   It says nothing.
[02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:55.300]   No, no.
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.500]   And looks like one of those captures.
[02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:02.060]   Can you see the taxi in that?
[02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:03.060]   It's not yellow.
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:07.260]   Stacy Higginbotham, Stacy on IOT, subscribe to her newsletter is free and you must because
[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:09.500]   it's full of good stuff.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:15.460]   You should also listen to her wonderful podcast that she does with that Beatles fan Kevin
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:16.460]   Tofel.
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:20.660]   It's called the IOT podcast and she joins us every God of Chromebooks.
[02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:23.420]   What no one tell Kevin if I'm going to get him this.
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:24.420]   I haven't decided yet.
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:25.420]   What?
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:26.460]   Is he watching?
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.420]   He might.
[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:30.220]   He usually I am span if he's watching.
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:31.220]   Okay.
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:32.220]   So we'll see.
[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:33.220]   So what are you going to get him?
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:34.220]   You didn't say.
[02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:35.220]   Well, now I'm not going to.
[02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:40.980]   I guarantee you people noticed if they, if they pay, if they were paying attention, Leo.
[02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:43.420]   Did you show something on the screen that I missed?
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:45.820]   Oh, man, I missed it.
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:46.820]   All right.
[02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:47.820]   We won't say a word.
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:48.820]   Talk about it.
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:50.460]   Oh, what we talked about.
[02:10:50.460 --> 02:10:51.460]   Oh, okay.
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:52.460]   I was here for that.
[02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:56.780]   I think you're going to get him a woodcut out that says Leon.
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:57.780]   Is that right?
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:10:58.780]   That's right.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:10:59.780]   That's right.
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:00.780]   That is what I'm getting.
[02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:01.780]   He'll like this.
[02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:02.780]   Dude's 80.
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:06.700]   He'll realize that he'll really enjoy that.
[02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:08.260]   Thank you, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:10.660]   He is ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:13.420]   He is.
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:17.700]   It says it right here, the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:22.220]   at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:24.820]   Thank you, Craig Newmark.
[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:29.020]   Without you, we would have the man, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:30.820]   Anything you want to plug coming up?
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:31.820]   Nope.
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:32.820]   Nope.
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:33.820]   He'll be back next week.
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:34.820]   Yep.
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:35.820]   Okay.
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:36.820]   Where am I going to go?
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:37.820]   Yeah.
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:38.820]   Where am I going to go?
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:39.820]   I can't go anywhere.
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:40.820]   I'm going to be here.
[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:42.860]   Jason, how I'll be taking over the show starting next week.
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:45.580]   And apparently you like him better.
[02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:51.380]   Mr. Ann Pruitt, he is a host of Hands-On, Wellness, Hands-On Photography and a fine man.
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:53.020]   Oh, I didn't get to talk about my remarkable.
[02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:56.300]   That was actually my pick of the week, but we'll save that for another time.
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:57.820]   Actually, I want to give it a little.
[02:11:57.820 --> 02:11:58.820]   I only got it yesterday.
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:00.780]   I want to give it a week and then I'll talk.
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:02.420]   Try to do it some PDFs on the other.
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:03.420]   Yes.
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:05.420]   Because you said the round tripping of PDFs is not good.
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:06.420]   Yeah.
[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:07.420]   That could be a problem.
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:09.420]   Plus, if you tell me I was stupid, then I'm going to feel brave about it.
[02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:10.420]   No, you're not.
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:11.420]   You're not stupid.
[02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:12.420]   You're Jeff.
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:13.900]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:17.740]   You're going to be on the SmugMug podcast tomorrow, right?
[02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:18.740]   Yes, sir.
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:25.540]   I'll be on SmugMug Live at 11 AM Pacific time, December 3rd, 11 AM Pacific.
[02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:32.900]   Just sharing some insight on my background and so forth, then just hopefully inspiring
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:33.900]   some folks.
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:38.260]   The wonderful Alistair Jolly should be a lot of fun.
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:39.260]   SmugMug Live.
[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:41.180]   I'm really excited about this.
[02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:42.500]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:46.940]   But also, folks, just go out there and share hands-on photography and hands-on wellness
[02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:49.580]   and just let other people know about the shows.
[02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:51.220]   Help me really enjoy doing these shows.
[02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:52.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:53.220]   Thank you.
[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:54.220]   Oh, Xbox Live is down.
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:55.580]   I meant to say that a minute ago.
[02:12:55.580 --> 02:13:00.220]   I got a big notification from all of the family members here in the house.
[02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:01.420]   Hey, what's wrong with Xbox?
[02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:03.620]   Did you pay that Xbox Live bill?
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:04.620]   Uh-oh.
[02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:05.620]   Uh-oh.
[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:07.620]   We're not going home.
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:10.860]   So that may mean something to folks listening right now.
[02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:12.580]   Of course, services was down.
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:13.780]   Yeah, look at that.
[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:14.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:19.300]   Yeah, Count and Profile Friends and Social Activity and Multiplayer Gaming Suffering.
[02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:24.900]   A limited outage right now.
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:25.900]   That's it for this week at Google.
[02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:28.820]   We do the show every Wednesday, round one 30.
[02:13:28.820 --> 02:13:31.500]   No, actually two now, two o'clock Pacific.
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:33.260]   That's five Eastern time.
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:34.540]   That's 2200 UTC.
[02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:37.580]   You are more than welcome to watch us do it live.
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:43.500]   You can see all the mess ups, all the screw ups, all the swearing, the disappearing, all
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:48.100]   of that is live at Twitch.tv/liveaudio and video.
[02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:52.020]   After the fact, the show becomes available a couple hours after the show.
[02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:55.660]   We edit it and put it up on Twitch.tv/twig.
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:58.340]   We also put it on the This Week in Google YouTube channel.
[02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:02.180]   But you know, you'll really have to think about it if you subscribe in your favorite
[02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:03.180]   podcast application.
[02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:06.140]   It'll automatically download and you'll have it ready.
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:09.700]   There's audio and there's video.

[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:28.220]   Have you gotten tired of how bad your photos are looking every time you post on Instagram?
[02:14:28.220 --> 02:14:33.460]   Better yet, have you gotten yourself a new camera and you can't quite figure out why the images
[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:35.140]   just don't look that good?
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:37.140]   So, I have a solution for you.
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:39.940]   It's my show, Hands on Photography.
[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:44.140]   Each and every Thursday I sit down to share different tips and tricks that are going to
[02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:48.980]   help make you a better photographer and a better post processor.
