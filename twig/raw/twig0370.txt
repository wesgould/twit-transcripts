[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.200]   Well, I don't know what we're going to talk about today because Jeff Jarvis is out for the
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   week.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.480]   So is Stacy Higginbotham both are traveling doing other things.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.920]   On the other hand, we've got a great panel here and we're just going to talk about whatever
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.520]   they want to talk about starting from my left with Aaron Newcomb who is of course a welcome
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.040]   regular on our network in a lot of ways to see him a lot on Floss Weekly.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.560]   Thank you Aaron for being here.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.640]   You bet anytime.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.360]   Just was on the new screen savers.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.280]   And works for NetApp which is a storage company.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.280]   That's correct.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.200]   If you keep this podcasting stuff, you may be able to make that a full time gig.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.280]   Hey, you never know.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.880]   Also here to his right is Kevin Marks, our good friend, champion of the N.D. web.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.000]   Nice to see you again, Kevin.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Good to see you too.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.360]   Kevin's thumbs are all over the technology you use every day starting with the BBC and
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.720]   then Apple with QuickTime and Google itself, British Telecom.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.600]   You can find more at Kevin Marks.com or of course, indywebcamp.com.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.640]   Or indyweb.org as it is now.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.000]   Oh, you got indyweb.org.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I like it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Yes.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.840]   Did you have to buy that or was it just floating around?
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.760]   No, I think we just, someone got it a while ago but we decided to switch over because it's
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.680]   not just about the camp, it's about the...
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680]   It's about the indyweb.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   But the indyweb.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   And that's a cause I sure can get behind.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.720]   I'm a big supporter of that.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.960]   So with this, haven't seen him in a while, I'm thrilled to get Matthew Ingram from Fortune
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   here.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   Hey, Matthew.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   Hey.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   What is that sure?
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.000]   Are you wearing a hockey jersey?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.440]   No, this is, I think this is from the Dominican Republic.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.520]   Oh, you confuse me.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.240]   I can wear a hockey jersey if you want.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   It's from Canada.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.120]   Why is it even wearing a hockey jersey?
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120]   Happy birthday, Kevin Marks.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.760]   They're telling us yesterday was your birthday.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   I didn't realize it.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   It was a deep number of days.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   Happy birthday.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.760]   Nice to have you.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   Thank you.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.760]   Should we sing?
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760]   Yeah, no.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   You can't though.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   That's the good news.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.760]   I don't know.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.840]   We don't have to play Warner's Chappelle Music a penny.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Mine was Saturday.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.640]   So happy birthday to you.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   You too.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   There we go.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640]   We're like twins almost.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.880]   Nice.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.440]   I would ask you what sunset you are, but I don't think it really makes any difference
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440]   at all.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   Thirty.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.160]   I don't know.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.840]   What do you want to talk about today?
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.640]   We're still waiting for the other shooter drop on now that Apple has announced its phones.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.880]   We'll be with great interest that we'll watch.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:21.600]   The rumor is in three weeks Google announced its phones, the code name, no longer Nexus.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.400]   These will be Pixel phones.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:32.720]   If you're to believe the rumors, Android police says Google's Pixel phones will be the iPhone
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.760]   competitors we've demanded for years.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.280]   I agree with the premise, which is that Google has really punched down a little bit with
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   these phones.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.080]   Initially, they were developer phones.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.080]   That's fine.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.880]   You just have a platform that's pure, clean, and suitable for a developer with the latest
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.800]   version of Android was sufficient.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.320]   But I want, especially in light of all the malware and the problems we're seeing out
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.320]   there.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.600]   I want to see a flagship phone come out of Mountaine.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.680]   They have been that, to some extent.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.640]   The six-piece pretty good.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.840]   Well, the thing is the one before the six, but it's the matter of one.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   You have the six.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.840]   The shammoo.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.160]   The world's largest.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.320]   You have the phone that proved to me that six inches is too big.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.280]   I just love the screen on it.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.080]   It's 8 under six inches.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.400]   We know now, of course, that the Note 7 is no longer a pretender to the throne, which
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   is very sad.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.880]   What a great phone.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   I would see.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.040]   But what I'd like to see is a Note 7-like phone made by Google with guaranteed Android
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   updates.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.480]   Will they do that this time around?
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.640]   Matthew, you agree.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.480]   You seem to think this would be a good thing.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.480]   I do.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.640]   I've been happy with-- I've had Nexus's.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.000]   I don't have one right now.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.160]   I've gotten LG, but I was happy with them.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.240]   But I think they've never really reached the same level, competitively, where they were
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.440]   going to appeal to a huge numbers of people.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.520]   Because they're not sold by a carrier, partly, right?
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.520]   Partly.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.600]   And so people just weren't exposed to them.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.320]   But also, all the benefits of them seem just too nerdy to explain to people.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.400]   So I get updates pushed straight from Google.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.440]   That doesn't-- most people-- it's hard to explain why that's a big deal.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.360]   And I just think this sort of-- the finish and the production and just the marketing
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:44.080]   of them or lack of marketing, they never really hit the kind of same level.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.320]   I think there's a perception.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   I don't-- true or not.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.280]   And I think Google contributes to this perception that Android phones are the cheap phone.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.760]   There are certainly a lot of cheap Android phones out there.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.120]   But that's why I would love to see-- and I guess for-- I guess Samsung are the not--
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.880]   I mean, $850 for a Note 7.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   That's right up there with Apple.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880]   It's not a cheap phone.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.640]   And you can cook on it, apparently.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.000]   You could use it as a spy.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I actually had one.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I loved it.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   It was a great phone.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And mine was not problematic at all.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Never got a lot.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   No.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   But I didn't dare keep it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.640]   I can't take it out of plane.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   Well, that's right.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.240]   I don't want to be singled out at the gate.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240]   I'm enforcing that.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.880]   Are they looking at people's phones?
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.360]   Actually, I know someone-- I saw someone mention on Twitter they had to prove that they had
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.600]   a Note 6, I think it was.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   You're kidding.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   That was a Note 7.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   Really?
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   Wow.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   Wow.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   Is this overblown?
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.440]   I mean, we know that there's only been maybe 70 incidents.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   Sure.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   Two and a half million phones.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.440]   But--
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.240]   And it was only-- I said it while being plugged in.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.240]   It doesn't do.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.240]   Well, I--
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.240]   It's only--
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.920]   I see Samsung for their alacrity and thoroughness in the recall.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.800]   I don't praise them for their forthcomingness, if that's a word.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   In other words, they haven't--
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   It is.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   No.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   It is.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   I just made it a word.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   They haven't really told us what it is.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   What's the problem?
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   No.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   No.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.320]   Well, and that's a big problem for them, actually, too, because they-- sources have said that
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.680]   this only affects North American or at least this side of the-- of the Pacific.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.680]   This-- phones that we'll see--
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.680]   Phones that we'll see--
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   Phones that we'll see here.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   Samsung affiliate battery.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.680]   Right.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.680]   As opposed to Chinese battery.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.680]   That's what it appears to be.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.840]   But that's not the way a lot of media outlets are reporting in, especially the ones that
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   don't know any better.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   Right.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.840]   Well, you don't want to report--
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   Okay.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   So I had the Chinese phone.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.360]   And I brought it into T-Mobile.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   And the T-Mobile clerk said, well, you know, this is the one made in China, you're probably
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   okay.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.040]   And I said, well, is it your recommendation that I not turn it in?
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040]   He said, no.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.160]   No, no, no.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.440]   My recommendation-- no, please.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.200]   My recommendation is you turn it in.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.240]   Nobody wants to be the one that said, well, that phone's okay.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   And Samsung's not saying.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.920]   I mean, I wish they would.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.000]   There was a phony IMEI database.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.440]   Don't trust that.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.640]   Samsung isn't even really saying exactly what's wrong.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.800]   So we don't even know if it's only while charging.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.120]   Although apparently they've said we're only-- we're going to send it an update in a week
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.360]   or two that will only allow you to charge your note 7% to 60%.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.240]   That kind of implies it's an overcharging problem.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240]   Right.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240]   And they have said it's the battery, right?
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   We know it's a battery.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.240]   Well, it's clear the battery.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.560]   I mean, that's where the energy is.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.040]   Well, if you look at where the burn is happening, it's right over the battery.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.080]   The battery is a slice of the phone, like right here on the side.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.040]   And if you look at it, that's clearly--
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.040]   But they said--
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.600]   But they have three challenges.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.680]   Knowing what's wrong, because if it's some low tolerance thing, if it's once the thing's
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.800]   burned, you can't tell.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   Right.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.520]   But it basically is something sorting out the battery and it's something that gets into
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.320]   our energy into a piece of metal and that starts to fire.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.880]   That's the mechanism for these things.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.960]   At this point, it's going to be very hard to know what's true.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.400]   There was a kid yesterday who was burnt.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.320]   They thought by a note 7, turned out by a different Samsung phone, not while charging
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.080]   while he was holding it.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   Mm.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.080]   6-year-old.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:10.640]   Well, the video that you see, if you look at it carefully-- and this is the video that
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.480]   started at all-- that's right where the battery is.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.320]   And there are those who claim you can see where the fire began up here, right where
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.280]   the circuitry that keeps the battery from overcharging.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.160]   There's circuitry in lithium-ion batteries that not only prevents overcharging but has
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.320]   heat sensors.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.680]   So if the battery starts to heat up while charging, we'll disconnect.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:40.600]   And all of those things are designed to prevent exactly this, which is catching on fire.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.880]   And because, by the way, it's in such-- there's the follicle chemicals inside of lithium-ion
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.280]   batteries.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.680]   And so they burn.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.320]   And it's in a very enclosed space.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.960]   So that's where you get the explosion.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.160]   It's like you're burning inside a pressure cooker.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:01.720]   And so there are those who say, I can look at the phone and I can tell where that it's
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.560]   happening right exactly where you'd expect it from an overcharge problem.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.320]   Nevertheless, I wish Samsung would say exactly what's going on.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.680]   I would love for them to say, here's how to tell.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.600]   But apparently they don't know because they're going to take them all back.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.360]   That must cost them a lot of money.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.080]   There's going to be a billion dollars or so.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.520]   And not to mention the damage to their reputation.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.280]   Well, the stock cratered.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.360]   I mean, if you look at the stock chart, it's bounced back since--
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.160]   That's probably not fair because it's only a small percentage of Samsung's overall revenue
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.640]   is the mobile.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.680]   But those things always get-- I mean, it's just such a black eye.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.760]   You know, it's $26 billion of market value.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   It's like you had one job, right?
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.960]   Yeah, not to have your phone blow up.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   Right.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.960]   Yes.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.680]   Yeah, list of things your phone should not do.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.200]   One, catch on fire.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.600]   It's distributed by XKCD in about 651.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.000]   Okay, let's get it here.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.560]   XKCD-651.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.160]   Here's somebody in the chat room says that he was on a United flight from Nashville to
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.880]   Newark this week.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:17.320]   And the flite attendant said, "If you have a Samsung device, you have to turn it off.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.600]   We're not going to check to see whether it's a Note 7 or not.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.080]   Just turn off all Samsung devices."
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.800]   But I don't even know if that's the right answer because if it's only during charging,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   here's XKCD.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.160]   But if you're worried about bombs, why are you letting me keep my laptop batteries?
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.440]   If I overvulted them and breached themselves, it would make a sizable explosion.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.920]   And his wife or girlfriend says, "Oh God, it's okay, dear."
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.040]   In a moment, he'll realize I have a good point and return my water.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.040]   Oh dear.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   Oh dear.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.040]   Yep.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.080]   Yeah, you really don't want to talk logic with the TSA.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   No.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.080]   You just want to shut up.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   Just shut up.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.080]   Just shut up.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.080]   You're beautiful.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.760]   Do what everything say.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.160]   And thank God you got on your plane.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.520]   Anyway, I actually feel bad for Samsung.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.200]   I think they made a great device.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.520]   They obviously made a mistake.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.200]   This was supposedly, and again, I would like to use Samsung's story.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   But what I've read is that the Samsung battery affiliate, for the first time they'd used
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.320]   this new Samsung battery affiliate, and they were the ones who made the bad batteries,
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.920]   that no recall in China because China requires all the phones be made in China with Chinese
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.520]   components, including the battery.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.760]   My T-Mobile phone, as I think most T-Mobile phones were made with Chinese batteries in China.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.000]   Didn't have the, what is it, TSDI, TDSI battery that support.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   But again, a lot of this is conjecture.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.560]   I feel like we should have...
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.000]   Apparently the stock lost $14 billion in value.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Wow.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   But you know what, to me, that's a buy signal because Samsung...
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.200]   ...makes bulldozers and refrigerators.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   Exactly.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   And it has rebounded.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.400]   Oh, and even if it's a massive recall, right?
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   It's only a couple of billion.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.720]   It's 5% of their business than mobile business.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   It's not.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   Wow.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:10.200]   So I think there's some overreaction and at the same time, like my T-Mobile salesman,
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.280]   if you ask me, "Should I return it?"
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   Yes!
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   Yes!
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.640]   Because they give you your money back and they give you a $25 credit.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.560]   The sad thing is they don't have Note 7s to replace it with.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   Right.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   Everything that anybody who says they'll have them in a week or two is wrong.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.760]   There's no way, especially now that Samsung's gone to the Consumer Product Safety Commission
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.560]   and is working on a full total real legal recall, there's no way they're going to be
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:44.200]   able to get that fund back in the country without tests.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.440]   And how long is that going to take?
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.960]   Yeah, that's really too bad because these are effectively lost customers for the large
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   part, I think.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   Right?
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:00.680]   Because these are people, if you bought a 7 when it came out, that means you're a leader
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   in this.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.360]   You're willing to spend a lot of money for that big phone and you're not going to go
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.760]   get an alternative phone like a Galaxy or...
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.360]   That's the customer you could get.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   So there's nothing really available for that customer.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.560]   Yeah, there is.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.560]   Just happens.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.520]   Apple just came out with a new phone.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.560]   And it's the same price.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:25.440]   And I bet you Apple, 50% of those Note 7 customers went to Apple, I would bet you.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.640]   Because there isn't anything comparable in the Android space.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   Right.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   The Galaxy is actually...
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   That's true.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   That's 7 is pretty close.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.200]   But it's last, you know, it's six months old.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.640]   Anybody who buys a Note 7 wants the latest grace.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.640]   In fact, no surprisingly, Apple stock hit a new hub.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   Samsung down, Apple up.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.640]   What a surprise.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.320]   Apple's already said they're not going to report weekend sales figures, pre-sale figures
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.440]   because whatever the number is, it's just supply number because the demand exceeds
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   the supply.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.640]   And I think that that's true.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.480]   Just anybody who's tried to get a new iPhone knows they're pushed back now to November.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.400]   Same thing with the watches.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.600]   Apple fans just...
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.720]   If nothing else, they're consistent.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.520]   And you know, so Apple's...
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.280]   I think Apple's going to benefit greatly.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   Oh, definitely.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.280]   Definitely.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.280]   Apple fans are like that Futurama meme.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.760]   Just shut up and take my money.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760]   Right.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.320]   I don't want to hear anything about it.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.320]   And how...
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   And how...
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.520]   You know, once you lose that customer, I very much guess it's a zero-sum game.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.960]   Once you lose that customer, Samsung's not getting them back.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.960]   Until the iPhones start blowing.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.080]   Well, that's the other thing.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.080]   This has happened to everybody, including Apple's had this...
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   It has.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.360]   ...the sales had this problem, Toshiba had to do a recall.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.080]   Lizzie Myon batteries are inherently kind of dangerous.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:51.080]   Yeah, remember that Dell video of the laptop with flames coming?
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   Right.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   Right.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.080]   Right.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.840]   I mean, this XKCD comics is actually correct.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   These things are...
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.840]   Of course, you don't sit on your laptop, typically.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.600]   Well, you don't have it in your pocket.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.160]   You're not holding it in your hand.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.160]   I wonder.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.720]   So you bring in your phone.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.920]   You can get a loner.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.240]   In some cases, the loner is like the Samsung, you know, wonderment or something.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.200]   It's some weird, you know, crap phone.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.400]   And you're supposed to use that until the Note 7's come in.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:27.480]   But in a month when they still haven't come in, what are people going to do?
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.920]   And so I just took the money.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   I said, "Fine.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.320]   Give me a credit.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.600]   I'll figure out what to do."
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   But I'm going to...
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.760]   I also have other phones I could use.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.120]   What if that's your phone?
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.920]   You buy an iPhone.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.920]   Maybe not.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.920]   Maybe Android.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.000]   Notes, love notes.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.680]   I'm a huge note fan.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.960]   I've had every Galaxy Note.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.960]   I love them.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.960]   I love the big screen.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.840]   I love the stylus.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.960]   Anyway, so...
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.200]   Yeah, it's never appealed to me for some reason.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   You know what's...
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:07.080]   If you held the Note 7 before it exploded, you would note that it is a bigger screen
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   than the iPhone.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.840]   It's 5.7 inches.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.040]   It is much higher resolution than the iPhone.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   It's OLED.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.360]   It's a beautiful screen in a smaller package.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.680]   Yeah, that's fair.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.680]   So you get...
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.920]   The bezels on the iPhone aren't going on the Note.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920]   There's no bezels.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920]   And...
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.280]   Maybe it's just the stylus throws me off.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.080]   Well, you don't have to use it.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.080]   But that...
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.120]   By the way, if you don't want a stylus and you don't need the bigger screen, you can
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.280]   get the slightly smaller as 7.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.240]   It's the same, basically the same hardware.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.480]   It sounds like Apple's going to get rid of the hard button.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.480]   They do.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.480]   And try and...
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.480]   Yeah, it goes to...
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   So it's a full screen.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.080]   So in the 7, it's a haptic button.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   So it's...
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.680]   There's a ring there.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.680]   You can feel it.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.880]   But it doesn't actually...
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   It's not actually mechanicals.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.480]   Like when they went from the spinning click wheel on the iPod to the static click wheel.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.480]   Right.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.800]   And then apparently it buzzes.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.040]   I haven't held it yet though.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.640]   I've talked to several who have.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.760]   But it sounds like they're going to get rid of that completely.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.640]   And then the room just needs to be screwed.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.640]   So the room is...
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   Next year.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.440]   I figure they're going to get rid of all holes.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.800]   Oh, it's going to be as close to a slab of glasses they can get.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.720]   Wouldn't even be surprised if they got rid of the lightning port, although that would
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   be a disaster.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.000]   And there'll be no power button.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   It's just on all the time.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.800]   You can't turn it off.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   Oh.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   We know when to turn it off.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   We'll take care.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   We'll turn it off for you.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.360]   We can tell, well, they can't when you're not using it.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   They can.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.360]   What do you need an on off button for?
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.360]   We'll take it for you.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.360]   Good question.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   That's Apple's philosophy.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.360]   We'll take it from here.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.360]   So October...
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.520]   So it's supposedly rumor is October 4th.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:54.000]   We'll see the Pixel phones reading at the Android developer site, developer.android.com.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.080]   This is something developers are greatly interested in.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:04.000]   The adoption rate on various Android operating systems.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.320]   There is 0.1% of all Android phones are still running.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   Fro-yo.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   Wow.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   2.2.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.840]   1.5% gingerbread, 1.4% ice cream sandwich.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.480]   It goes up though.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.280]   By the time you get to Jelly Bean, and there are three different versions of Jelly Bean
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.800]   4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, you're getting some numbers here.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.880]   I'll do some...
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.880]   Let's see.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:30.720]   That's 13, maybe 15, maybe 16% Jelly Bean KitKat 27%.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.440]   That's 4.4.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:41.600]   So almost half of all the Android devices are running for or earlier.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.040]   Then Lollipop.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.000]   Lollipop's this nice big wedge here.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   That's the last one.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.800]   That's not the biggest single one, isn't it?
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.760]   That's a total of 24%.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.400]   25%, sorry.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.520]   One quarter of all.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520]   That's 35%.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.520]   30?
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.520]   Yeah, right.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.520]   35%.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520]   Wow.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.000]   More than a third of all Android phones are running 5.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.640]   Marshmallow, 18.7%.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.480]   Apparently, NuGet is not even big enough to show on this chart.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.480]   Wow.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.480]   It's less...
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   Is that the live one?
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.640]   Yeah, it's less than 0.1% for NuGet.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.480]   But that's only because there's only...
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.400]   The only people who have NuGet right now are people who have pix...
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   Nexus's.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   Yep.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.400]   And...
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400]   Why me?
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.840]   And I guess that new LG phone is going to be the first phone shipping with NuGet.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.440]   That's all right.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.360]   I mean, the problem is there's massive Android malware flaws.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.600]   There's a new one.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.560]   And nobody is protected.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.560]   They're just...
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.720]   I think the September Android security update fixes it.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.120]   But I don't think I have it on my 6P yet.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.000]   If I...
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   I mean...
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.200]   If you don't have a Nexus, you're not going to get it for a while.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.640]   That's not good for Android.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.720]   I feel like it's like the presidential election.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720]   There's really no...
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.920]   There's no good choice.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.840]   There's no good choice.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.360]   So who's Trump in this?
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   I don't know.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.880]   I think Android is Trump.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.640]   And the day the course...
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.360]   Apple is the stay the course safe choice.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.360]   Right.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.920]   Android is gonna...
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.920]   Android is the...
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.160]   Well, you know, it's different.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.200]   It could be good.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.960]   It's definitely experimental and it could also blow up in your hands.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.480]   I think it is actually a very close metaphor.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.920]   Not to get political or anything, but I...
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   I feel like that we are at this point now where I prefer Android phones, but I'm nervous
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.960]   about the rapid spread of malware.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.520]   There were so many apps that had this...
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.520]   This is not...
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.560]   This is a zero day.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.600]   There are two and a half million downloads of one of the exploits in Google's Play Store.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   I got it by...
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   You did?
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.240]   How did you know?
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.520]   Well, it just started everything when haywire.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   Oh my God.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:16.960]   I don't know for sure that that's what it was because I'm not an Android software engineer
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.360]   and I don't understand enough about...
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.920]   Did you wipe the phone and start over?
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.920]   You started after, right?
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.840]   I literally just started having seizures.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.760]   Google Play Store would not load.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   Wow.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:33.040]   Google Play Services, the underlying service would not load.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.680]   Kept saying it wasn't there, but it was there.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.360]   Tried a whole bunch of different things.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.920]   Eventually, you just had to wipe the phone.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.640]   Well and that's probably a smart thing to do because the worst case scenario is that
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:52.880]   you wouldn't have any weird symptoms, but you would be rooted and have malware on there.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.520]   And the problem with that one is, you know, they...
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.040]   So weird things start happening with your phone.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:04.280]   Like 99% of phone owners would just have no clue what to do.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.200]   Just turn it off and turn it back on again.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.880]   They don't know, you know, they're not going to go looking for how do I, you know, reinstall
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.720]   Google Play Services when I can't get to the Play Store.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.440]   They're just going to be like, "My phone is busted."
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.440]   Right.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   They'll bring it in.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.720]   But again, I'd far prefer that to the worst case which is...
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:29.440]   Everything seems completely normal, but meanwhile everything you're doing is being passed off.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.280]   Security expert, this is one of these is called dress code.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.680]   40 different Google Play Store applications.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.160]   Nates.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:50.320]   One of the most popular apps downloaded between 100,000 and 500,000 times.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.640]   So the advice here, by the way, is, well, make sure you buy an Android phone from somebody
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.240]   who has already agreed to take the Android security updates.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:05.040]   Two, don't download frivolous apps.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.560]   Like the worst one was a clash of clans.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.480]   It was a hack that purported to give you a clash of clans gold.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.960]   Don't fall for that.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.960]   Right.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.960]   You know, get your apps from well-known...
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.160]   It's not Facebook and Snapchat that are the problem.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.680]   It's, you know, chest of gold for clash of clans.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.440]   I don't know this again because I'm not smart enough, but what started happening before
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:42.560]   this happened to me was I got Google Play pop-ups generated by random websites.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.760]   And I'm pretty sure they weren't...
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.960]   That's almost surely malware, right?
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.160]   And so then all it takes is to click on that.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.400]   It comes up so quickly.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   Right.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.960]   You're not sure what to do.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:01.000]   You know, you don't have to necessarily install the whole thing.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.480]   It's kind of depressing because I love Android and I really don't like the direction Apple's
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.760]   taking into a more and more closed environment.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.920]   I like to have more power over my phone, but I just don't know.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.880]   I mean, I guess my choice at this point after giving up the Note 7 is I'm only going to
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.920]   get a Google made phone.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:26.160]   That's why personally I hope that they do a flagship quality from phone.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.360]   I want it to be the best and I want Google to make the best Android phone you could buy.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.920]   Why wouldn't they at this point?
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.760]   Well, and yet it sounds like from the Android police thing as though it's not going to
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.280]   be, you know, top of the line.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   HTC, right?
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.280]   Which I like.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:50.960]   I'm glad to see HTC back in the game, although everything that all the rumored stuff that's
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:57.720]   leaked so far doesn't look like there's anything new or good or interesting about the phones,
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.480]   except that they're made by HTC.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.480]   Right.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.480]   One of the complaints.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   Go ahead, Kevin.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.600]   So the other thing that the Google did was make phones at a good price point.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.840]   The Nexus 5 was very well competitively priced and the Motorola ones were actually pretty
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.920]   competitively priced when they were doing those as well.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.520]   So offer two.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.520]   Offer two.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   Offer a $400.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   That's the thing.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.680]   And you read the way you save is the way that one plus three has saved and Axon has saved
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.760]   and the honor eight from Huawei has saved, which is taking out some of the higher end
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:36.720]   features and then make one that is a I would love to see a no compromises phone from Google.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.800]   Anyway, you have to go by the same.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.640]   Like one of each.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.400]   And you know what Google, this is the solution to the note seven problem.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.440]   This is solution to the malware problem.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.360]   And this is I think kind of what Google's thinking is we got to take, we got to solve
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:58.920]   this or we're going to, you know, Android is going to end up being a, you know, a ghetto.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.280]   By the way, you compare.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.160]   So Marshmallows 18.7%.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.200]   It's been out for more than a year.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.800]   iOS 10, which came out on Monday.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.120]   14 and a half percent already in three days.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.600]   Actually, that's one day.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   Yes.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   24 hours.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   You.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.560]   It's probably, it's probably 25% by now.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.800]   And that's and that's with rumors of them breaking phones.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   Yes.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.280]   And then the first hour, they're apparently breaking phones.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.000]   So, yeah, I saw a lot of that.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And Apple says they fixed that.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   All right.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Enough about phones.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.720]   We have a show called all about Android.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.640]   That's probably a better place.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:43.040]   But well, the other one there was the, them saying they're making another seven inch one,
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.040]   which is the next seven.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   That's good.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.000]   Cause I, I love those devices.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.040]   I've still used them and I thought I wanted them to keep making that form factor.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.040]   It's a really good form factor.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.880]   You know, so interesting.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.240]   Everybody who had an ex, or not everybody, but many, many people.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.440]   And I include myself as long as well as you love that size.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.440]   There's something about that size.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.640]   Now you like Shamu.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.640]   You like the six inch.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.640]   Right.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.840]   Well, it's the size of a paper book.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.720]   It's exactly the exact size of a penguin, which means it's a really good one handed reading
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.720]   device.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.680]   Not an emperor penguin, a penguin publisher.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   Not an actual thing.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   Yeah, not an actual thing.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.760]   I still have my next seven right here in my drawer.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.760]   I use mine.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.520]   It's on my desk in the other studio.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.520]   I use it every day.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.360]   It reminds me of mine over there in the, in the other room now, but it's, but it's, it's
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.600]   a, it's a nice device.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.200]   It's the weights good.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.160]   It's big enough to watch TV on without feeling like you're squinting.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.720]   And it's, it's, it's big enough to read.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720]   It's a really important one.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.440]   And it works with it as a, as a device you can use on public transit.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.440]   And inexpensive.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.440]   Mm hmm.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.280]   What was that when they sold it was 200 something, right?
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.440]   The last one I bought was $150.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.440]   $150.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.040]   They're going up again now.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.200]   They're collectible.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.840]   So this one is supposedly will be built by Huawei, which I, which made the six P. I think
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.720]   Huawei is a very good Chinese phone manufacturer.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.800]   Four gigs of RAM.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.320]   That would mean a probably a premium device.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.840]   Uh, Evleek says on track for release before the end of the year, I would think, and we
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.320]   talked about this last week with Stacey, we're, we're thinking this October 4th announcement
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.240]   is going to be more than just phones.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.680]   They'll announce the availability of the Google home, uh, uh, Amazon Echo competitor.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.080]   4K Chromecast.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.280]   This could be a very big event.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.280]   It would make sense.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.560]   Google would wait till Apple, wait till all that.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.720]   And, uh, okay.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.480]   Now we're going to show what we got.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.640]   Uh, and the other thing is, would they have some of the VR stuff they were talking about
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.640]   in spring?
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.440]   Because that is that the daydream?
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   Daydream.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.440]   The daydream.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.000]   And they optimize hardware and things for that.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.280]   And the, the piece I'm wondering is, does that affect what cameras they use?
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   If they will make them via a capture device, is that maybe interesting as well?
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.280]   Oh, that'd be interesting.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   Although I have to say, um, I'm starting to think that VR was a flash in the pan.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.080]   I hate to say that.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.160]   It's the new 3D.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.960]   I think it, I, I really had higher hopes for it.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.760]   It plays better than 3D in the sense that the first time you use it, you get very excited.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.640]   But the problem in 3D, I don't think that's the case, but the problem is it, is that many
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.000]   people, it nauseates many people.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.920]   Uh, yeah, it's a, it's a good experience, but not a compelling, not the one that you
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.000]   want to spend hours a day in that sweaty visor.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.240]   I was talking to a guy who's in the business and, and I mentioned that the couple of times
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.760]   that I've tried, I get motion sickness, you know, using an electric toothbrush.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:39.280]   So it's a, it's a big problem.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.440]   And I was saying, you know, I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to use any of these devices.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.440]   And he said that they're, they're hoping at least that they can get past that.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.440]   Using technology.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.240]   So they've been saying this for years.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   Yeah, I know.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.040]   And so I've, the, it's kind of like big tobacco.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:05.880]   The, the, the industry or big sugar we're learning now, the industry, uh, line is, oh,
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   it's latency that's making you queasy.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.720]   And we can fix that with faster hardware.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.280]   And they say that and they've been saying it and they say it and every time the new
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.680]   Oculus Rift came out, they said, look, the latency's way down.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.320]   Isn't this much better?
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.480]   And it's not.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.080]   I'm convinced.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:27.560]   It's the disconnect between the convergence distance, your eyes being, if you have two
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.640]   eyes, converge on a point that is the point you're looking at.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.480]   And then in, in normal world, that would also be the focal distance.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:40.240]   You're looking at your finger, your focus on that and that'd be convergence.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.120]   And just as in 3D, by the way, it's the same problem with 3D in VR, your convergence, focal
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.360]   distance is not the same.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.360]   Right.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.760]   And I don't think they can fix that.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.360]   That's what makes you bark.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.880]   There's two things there.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.960]   One is there's two effects going on at once.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.960]   One is, um, focal distance and convergence.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.960]   You're right.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   That is an issue.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.000]   The other is that there's two ways you judge distance.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.320]   One is, are they, you know, are they, are they different focus?
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.040]   I forgot separate things.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.680]   The other thing you do is you move your head side to side and watch things move against
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.680]   the background.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.680]   Right.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:20.560]   Um, and that second one hasn't been possible until the late generation of VR because they
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.880]   the feedback loop wasn't quick enough.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.160]   So that one does make the difference.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.840]   It does reduce the nausea quite a lot.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.480]   But it means that they've got to keep that loop tied.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.680]   But yeah, the other problem of, um, I'm focusing here, but my eyes think it's over there.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.680]   That's a problem.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.680]   Um, that's, that's doable.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.760]   That's part of what's there are, um, things that there are headsets that do that, but they're
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:48.120]   mostly focus on the AR world and they're, they're not cheap enough to ship you in mass
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.120]   quantities.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.360]   They can act, but you can do the overlay stuff that works at different depths by having a
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.560]   light field thing that projects.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.560]   Right.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.880]   But yes, but they're, they're still in like research labs and they're not shipping this
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.880]   year.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.000]   Well, I'm really interested in that though, because I actually do think that mixed reality
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.080]   or whatever you want to call it, augmented reality, different companies have different
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.080]   terms.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.080]   I think that actually is a lot more.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   I agree.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.400]   Potential than, than true sort of VR.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   Right.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.840]   Uh, and that you don't get as nauseous because you have real world grounding points.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.840]   Exactly.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.480]   Uh, Tim Cook just said that in an interview.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:27.760]   Apple CEO said, yeah, we think augmented reality because VR seals you off from the world,
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.680]   augmented reality, you're part of the world.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.360]   We think, I think Apple, that's where Apple's putting their dollars.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.560]   And I think we've learned a little bit from the VR experiment.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.880]   Um, I, I'm really thinking, by the way, uh, thank you.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.520]   You haven't done it in the chat room has passed along an article where I love, I love
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.520]   this.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.680]   A VR researcher says, well, the problem is you need a virtual nose.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.320]   How to reduce VR sickness.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.120]   Just add a nose, a massive nose sitting in the game frame.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.240]   That doesn't feel right to me.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:10.320]   No, you know, that's a nice try, but it's just, it's not going to help with either one
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.320]   of those problems.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:18.480]   I think you can make VR tenable, but I think it's for a variety of reasons.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.800]   It's going to be hard to get people to spend hours in a VR helmet.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.760]   I think it could be great for some things.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:30.000]   I mean, I was fascinated by this company that's focusing on medical applications, um, not
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.880]   just for doctors and sort of operating, but for, you know, patients who are bedridden,
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:42.600]   um, to be able to escape and see, you know, parts of the world they may never see again.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.720]   I, I mean, that's fascinating.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.760]   That's not a broad kind of mass market application, but still interesting.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.760]   Well, I'm a, as somebody who's probably going to have to visit the world that way in the
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.400]   next 20 or 30 years, it's like, yeah, I'm looking forward to VR in the, in the nursing
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.400]   home.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.840]   Uh, because yeah, it'll open up a whole world to you.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.240]   And you know, a lot of this I think is in, I was just talking to somebody yesterday,
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.720]   uh, or on Monday, um, long time computer science guy.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.120]   And I said, I think a lot of this is influenced by the fact that we all read Neil Stevenson's
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.120]   snow crash.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.600]   And we just want the metaverse.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.080]   And he agreed.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.080]   He said, yeah, everybody was really reading Neil Stevenson 20 years ago.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.080]   That was the thing.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:31.520]   And we're all trying to figure out a way to jack in and be in this, uh, virtual environment.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.240]   But just the desire to make it so doesn't necessarily make me so.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.560]   Maybe second life will come back.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.920]   He was, by the way, this is the guy who wrote the Alphaville Herald or whatever, the newspaper
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:45.840]   in second life among, um, he also invented gopher pop man.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:52.040]   And, uh, it was very instrumental in, um, VRM early VRML experiments.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.040]   Who was this guy?
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.280]   We interviewed him on Monday.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.280]   Mark McCain.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.280]   Oh, okay.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   His name.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.280]   Great.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   Great interview.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.280]   I remember VRML.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.240]   And he was a big proponent of second life.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.360]   And he said, but the problem with second life is this kind of similar to the problem
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.400]   in all social networks.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.800]   When people are anonymous, they just act badly.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.040]   I'm going to push back on that one again as usual.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.800]   It's not, it's not about anonymity.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.920]   It's about social norms.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:25.840]   It's about how people have sort of decided that place behaves, what it's like.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.400]   So if there's a culture of misbehaving, then people join in that misbehavior.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.800]   If there's a culture of like working together and being polite, they'll join that culture.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.680]   He says something like that, which is the story or the purpose of the goal of the place
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.000]   also will help that.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Right.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Exactly.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.400]   And he talked about EVE Online, which is a massively multiplayer online role-playing
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   game.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.160]   He said, there are areas in EVE Online where you are evil.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.160]   That's part of the gameplay.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.240]   You choose evil.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:57.400]   But it's fine because it's sustained by this storyline in this rationale.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.040]   It's not chaotic evil.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.920]   Twitter is chaotic evil.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.320]   I don't know.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.560]   I think we took this already, let's say about this a couple of weeks ago.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.560]   Oh, good.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.680]   Is this on a Piggany or Figgany?
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.520]   No, no, this is on this is on.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.920]   I mean, not even that.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.000]   It's on a published publication.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   What?
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.200]   Like on 10 trees?
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.560]   Then we go to the meeting.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.840]   All right, you find it and we'll talk about it when we come back.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.080]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.320]   This is-- I always love Twig because it's our most intellectual show where we get the most
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.760]   abstract and interesting stuff.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.680]   And I think we couldn't have three better people to do that right now.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.080]   Kevin Marks from indiecamp.org.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.080]   Let's put that up.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.080]   Indieweb.org.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.600]   Sorry, take away the camp.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.960]   Leave the web.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   indieweb.org.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.080]   We'll put that in your lowest third, I think.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:56.920]   And from NetApp and a host on Floss Weekly and often co-host on new screensavers Aaron
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.680]   Newcomb, he still gives that as Google+ handle.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.040]   That's right.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.560]   I still use Google+ and I still prefer it way more than Facebook.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.560]   Oh, I do too.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.920]   But yeah, what do you guys do?
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.120]   I notice myself using social media a lot less than the last few months.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   Me too.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.480]   I've kind of-- I think I'm burn out on it.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   Yep.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.040]   I just want to keep to myself.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.960]   And that's why Matthew Ingram is in Ontario.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.320]   He's a fortune.com.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.000]   And another great thinker.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.680]   I love the big thinkers shows.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.440]   We'll have Warren just a little bit.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.640]   But first, a word from a brand new.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.800]   I'm very excited.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.520]   Sponsor who is a very old friend.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.320]   Maybe you saw our interview just a couple of weeks ago with David Hennemire Hanson,
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   DHH.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:47.120]   I've interviewed his partner Jason Freed many times.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.760]   You remember 37 signals?
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.200]   They're now base camp.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.840]   Last couple of years have been base camp.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:59.520]   Base camp three is all new and man, it just gets better and better and better.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:05.160]   The key-- and we experience it here-- is as an organization, as a company grows or a
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:12.280]   team grows from the easily managed handful of people to somewhere about 10 to 20 people,
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:20.440]   it just gets more difficult to have the communications, to stay on track, to work together.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.040]   And that's what base camp solves.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.200]   Jason and David and the people at base camp spend a lot of time thinking about better
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.480]   ways to work.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.520]   And base camp three is the tool you're looking for.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.120]   It brings everyone together.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.560]   And the tools are fantastic.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.840]   It's a cloud-based workspace.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.080]   So you don't have to host a server.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.080]   It's easy to use.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.520]   It's always secure.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.880]   And it puts everything-- Jason calls it a single point of truth.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.240]   A single-- so everything is in one spot.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:54.680]   All your companies, projects and communications, everyone knows what they need to do, can keep
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:59.160]   track of what they're doing and what others are doing, where things are on any project.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.720]   Everyone stays accountable.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.160]   But it's really better than that because it's not like enforcing accountability.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.480]   It's about communication.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.520]   Everybody wants to do a good job and base camp makes it possible.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:14.120]   The idea behind base camp is that as in a real base camp, where mountain climbers gather
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:20.200]   around the campfire and talk about their preparation to summit the same applies to business.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.600]   When you're working on a project, you sit around the campfire and you communicate.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.400]   This is all based on research.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.120]   It's hard core user research.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.880]   They discovered six core things that businesses of all size needed to do their work best.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.440]   Message boards, they call those campfires to stay with the metaphor.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.840]   That way everybody's on the same page.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.120]   And you also have a history automatically.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.640]   So you can look back.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.280]   Real-time chat, real-time pings.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.200]   So you can say, hey, what's-- ask a question.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:54.360]   Check-ins to make sure projects stay on track to do lists so people know who's responsible
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.360]   for what.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.880]   Of course, you've got to have document and file storage.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.200]   Not only your own, but it'll integrate with whatever you're using, whether it's Dropbox
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.840]   or Google Drive and all of that.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.000]   So everyone can access and work on the most up-to-date versions.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.280]   And then a schedule, a calendar, that integrates with all the existing calendar solutions so
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   you know where things stand, what's coming up, what you need to do.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.440]   This is the only product that gives you all the tools in one easy to use platform.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.560]   That saves you time and training and onboarding too.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.840]   It's also used a lot for client projects.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:32.240]   So it's not just internal collaboration, although it's great for that, especially if
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.640]   you have remote team members.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.960]   But you can use it with your clients too.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.120]   In fact, they have great setups so that your clients only see what you want them to see
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.960]   not the whole base camp, things like that.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.200]   You can create as many base camps as you want.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.560]   You invite the right people to each one.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.200]   But now this is the thing I love.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.760]   It's the reason I want to use it.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.160]   There's no per user fees.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.360]   Jason does not believe in seat licenses.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.200]   Companies of all sizes use base camp.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.760]   Teams say they can't live without it.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.080]   A hundred thousand businesses are using it today.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.320]   I went to the base camp site a couple of days ago.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.840]   Eight thousand people signed up for base camp last week.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.840]   Last week.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.760]   And it's free.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.520]   You could try it for free.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.560]   So it takes no time to learn.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.720]   They have, of course, lots of great tools to help you learn how to use it.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.640]   But you can sign up right now for a free trial.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.600]   Get your team on board when you're ready.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   Play around with it.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.120]   And look at the pricing because nobody has better pricing.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:29.400]   They really make it easy for small or large to do this.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:34.160]   And because they don't have 29 bucks a month, no matter how big your team is.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.160]   What?
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.920]   Yeah, this is awesome.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.640]   Base camp.com/twits.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.200]   Not even that right now.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   It's free.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.480]   Base camp.com/twits.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   Set it up.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.560]   Give it a try.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.000]   This is such a good solution.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.240]   If you, I'm sure you've heard about it.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.080]   Maybe you've read their books rework.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.560]   These guys really think a long time.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.400]   And I've got to love David and Jason.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.600]   They're really smart.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.560]   Basically David had my hands and wrote Ruby on Rails so he could write base camp.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.840]   So that's, that's kind of high recommendation.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.200]   Base camp.com/twit.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.280]   We got one off our code.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.280]   And I like that too.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.920]   Makes it a little bit easier.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.920]   All right.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.920]   What were we going to talk about?
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.920]   We were going to talk about social media.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.120]   We were going to talk about anonymity.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.120]   And you had an article that you were going to share with us, Kevin Marks.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.120]   Yes.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.920]   Which I have stuck in the running order and also in the chat.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.800]   It's called How Twitter Got Angry.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.800]   I read this.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   I read this.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.000]   I think I read this after our last conversation.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.800]   And I pitched it to a fast company and I said, will you like to publish this?
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   Sure.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:46.160]   So, and you know, I went, it's like 2000 words long.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.800]   So I'm really straight the entire thing.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.440]   But the, but it's, I'm remaking the argument that I've made before is that Twitter started
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.120]   out as a place that was primarily about following people and choosing who to follow.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.400]   It showed you who, it showed you stuff by choice.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:07.800]   And I got quotes from Evan and people talking about that early on.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.920]   We believe Twitter is a recipient driven utility.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.680]   You choose what content appears in your timeline.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.120]   It was what Jason Goldman said in 2008.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.280]   And that was the shape of it.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.800]   The idea was that you saw stuff that you followed.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.720]   The app replies were there, but they were off to the side.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.200]   You had to go and look for them specifically.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.280]   And they weren't the first thing you saw when you got to decide.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.640]   The first thing you saw was the people who chosen to follow.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.120]   And that shaped the kind of discourse you had there because you were mostly seeing stuff
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.320]   you chose in the sea.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.920]   And when the, when it became a mobile app and the app replies became notifications, that
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.680]   changed the character of Twitter because suddenly the most important thing was what
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.280]   someone was saying to you.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.520]   And it stopped you being about who you chose to follow and it became about who chose to
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.680]   shout at you.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:55.760]   Now that doesn't affect most users initially because people weren't aware of the mechanism
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.960]   and the effort to do an app is not that high, but it, it, it has an effect on people who
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:06.560]   stuff takes off because suddenly they get lots of that replies and that all appears.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.320]   And even, even if it's a benign thing.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:16.560]   So I had, I had a tweet last week that has got nearly a million views so far, which is
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.920]   I think is probably the most quite weird thing I've ever written.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.080]   And just the fact that happened meant that I, my, my phone was like buzzing continuously
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.080]   because I was getting replies and reposts and things to it.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.600]   And this, this, and this wasn't, that people weren't being mean to me.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.080]   They were just sharing it and commenting and doing that.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.640]   But just the sort of the level of traffic that was coming through changed my experience
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.960]   of Twitter and maybe like, maybe like, Twitter.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.520]   Oh, the tweet will take some explaining as well.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   I'll probably leave.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:54.080]   By the way, this is why I hate Twitter because it's a lot of very succinct, inevitably shortened,
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.840]   often highly abbreviated out of context messages.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:02.760]   I read my Twitter stream and I feel like I'm having a stroke like I am in a, I don't understand
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.560]   what's going on around.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   It does.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.560]   Yes.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.560]   Okay.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.560]   I'll put the tweet in the chat.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:09.560]   Hang on.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.560]   So this tweet.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.400]   I did that to my go ahead.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:18.160]   This tweet was one of the 30th August.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.160]   I wish this.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.480]   How to talk to a woman wearing headphones.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:27.520]   Be a Kardashev type two civilization in HD 164 595.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.560]   When I read that, by the way, there's Jody Foster in a headphone with a looking, you know,
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.040]   and this is from contact looking at the dish.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.080]   When I read that, I go, uh-huh, and I go to the next tweet.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.080]   Right.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.760]   So, so the point is this, and I thought that would be people's reaction because there
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:48.160]   were two, this was reacting to two news stories from two weeks ago.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.200]   There was the how to talk to a woman wearing headphones thing where some do should written
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.120]   this thing about, there's a woman wearing headphones.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.840]   What you should do is go up to her and wave your hands in her face, get to take the headphones
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.840]   off so that you can tell her she's cute.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.400]   That'll make friends and influence people.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.040]   And people were saying how dumb is this guy?
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.240]   And then there was a rang gaga of how to talk to a woman wearing headphones.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   Right.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:15.840]   And then the same day there was a story about picking up signals from the star HD 164595
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.440]   that may be aliens.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.400]   Which turned out to be human signals that about.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.000]   Yeah, we should turn that out to be like noise.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.360]   So basically that's why you're doing this.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:32.160]   You combine two completely junk culture tidbits into an incomprehensible tweet.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.760]   Well, this is exactly what I don't want about.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:47.120]   I thought it would be funny to people who were following feminist Twitter and site buy
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.120]   whatever.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.320]   And a million people have seen it and it's been shared.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.320]   Whatever.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.320]   And that gives you a good feelings.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:02.280]   Well, what gave me a good feeling in that I now have a great list of female scientists
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.960]   to follow because they were the basic ones that we're sharing.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.960]   Yeah, they knew about that meme.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.000]   Because they knew about the meme and they'd be like Jodie Foster and they knew about
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   that meme.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.840]   So I followed probably a thousand people who shared this now, maybe more.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.440]   And then you followed it up with how to talk to a woman wearing air pods, be in a parallel
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.240]   London with Zeppelin's and upgrade people to Cybermen.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.240]   For some reason that only got retweeted once in three hearts.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.520]   Yeah, they get what I was.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   See, it was a week later.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   Plus their Twitter is like.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.280]   I don't say people just get the.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.280]   I mean, maybe people didn't.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.280]   I love it.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   I love it.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   I love it.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   You love it.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.120]   And you find it valuable.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.240]   But it's one reason why I don't miss Twitter at all.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:49.920]   That's one of the things that fascinates me about it is you can have a tweet like that
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.120]   that will go completely viral and thousands of people will share it.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:50:00.280]   And then you can have one that's arguably better or more intelligent or and no one will
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   click on it.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.280]   It's completely random.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:07.400]   It's like the time of day or what memes are going around or one person shares it who's
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.360]   got a lot of followers and then other people see it that way.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:17.000]   I've had two or three where that's happened and it's been shared, you know, 150,000 times.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.480]   And I have no idea what differentiates that from the other ones that get like 10 clicks.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.520]   But that's true of media.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:30.200]   It has that power distribution and, you know, anything you publish, you'll have this like
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:34.160]   skewed distribution of people reading it and Twitter just.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.600]   Well, I wonder how much the algorithm is involved as well, though, right?
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.600]   Twitter.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.960]   It's a little bit now.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.520]   It's a little bit involved, but it's it's a fit.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.040]   That's part of what I'm saying about as well.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.640]   There's a feedback loop in the stuff that shared gets more shared because if it's retweeted,
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.040]   then more people see it and more people like to retweet it and then they're more likely
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.560]   to like it or whatever.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.480]   And so that that signal spreads out.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.080]   It does amplify it more, but it's at its core is driven by people.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.840]   So that the part of the power of Twitter is that ability for it to sift through the global
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:11.240]   meme space and all of us as individuals being synapses in that mean brain, sharing this
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.400]   stuff out further and making it come to the top.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:21.160]   And so part of the reason they put trending topics and the other bits at the top of Twitter
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:27.120]   is to say, look, we found this interesting stuff and things can take off and spawn out
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.960]   that and they're not predictable things.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.880]   They can be my mind, mine's a small ripple compared to some of the things that take off
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.320]   on Twitter, but they have been big things that do take off.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.400]   And that mechanism is a powerful thing.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:44.440]   But it also means that that combined with the way app replies work is a bit of a problem
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:49.280]   because it means if you do spawn something like that, then you get a bunch of people
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.880]   who think, well, hey, you get a bunch of idiots who make the same joke back to you or we spend
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.800]   to do something worse.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:01.680]   B, you get people who are going to be abusive to you because you're suddenly a big target
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.520]   and you're not geared up for it.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.760]   If you're not verified, you're not marked as a famous person, you don't have as many
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.640]   tools to damp that stuff down.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.560]   Well, I have to say, I always, I would be nervous about getting a lot of retweets because that
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:18.800]   pretty much guarantees that you're going to now start getting a bit of a preparation.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:25.120]   So one of the things that has changed, they just released it when I wrote this, but they've
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:28.760]   now got a thing that got a quality filter they turn on by default.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.880]   So it won't notify you about.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.880]   I know.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.520]   And I've turned that off because otherwise I won't see people who are doing damaging
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.520]   trolling.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.520]   What is that?
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.520]   What good is that to?
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.480]   I've never understood what Twitter's attitude is, we'll just block it.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:48.160]   That implies that the trolling is only damaging to you or, you know, like something you should
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.160]   see.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.120]   But in fact, it can be much, much more damaging.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:56.400]   We have one, there's one idiot troll we have out there who tweets all using that replies,
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.480]   every one of our sponsors.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.880]   And I have to see that because I have to see if, because I will hear from the sponsors
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.040]   if I don't quash it.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.760]   So I mean, he's trying to put us out of business.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.800]   So how does it help me if I don't see it?
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   Doesn't help me at all.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.200]   In fact, the only reason I see Twitter is because I have alerts that let me know that
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.480]   he's added again.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:22.760]   So I'm going and get his account suspended, which I do two or three times a day now.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.600]   I think that's fun.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:30.640]   I don't know whether Kevin would agree, but I think part of why Twitter got to where it
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:37.680]   is now is that in the early going, the company was very fixated on gross allowing speech.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.320]   No, not just free speech.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.320]   Yes.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.320]   Right.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.320]   Yes.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.520]   But allowing speech of all kinds and being the free speech wing of the free speech party
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.720]   and those sorts of things.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:52.000]   So their default was to allow speech and that has value obviously for a whole bunch of
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.720]   reasons, but it, I think it stopped them from thinking about the things that they could
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.400]   have done to stop that sort of trolling earlier.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.720]   I just, life is too short to read Twitter.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.200]   Of course, you got to read all of it.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:10.120]   But part of the point is that any of it, I'm too old to waste my time on this absolute
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   drivel.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.120]   Even the best stuff is drivel.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:17.480]   You know what's fascinating is my daughter, one of my daughters is obsessed with Twitter.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.600]   She's on it all the time.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.600]   She's 18.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.040]   She's because she's, I don't think she thinks she's going to live forever.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.040]   She got mad at me because I did what Kevin described.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:31.280]   I retweeted one of her tweets because I thought it was funny.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.280]   Oh, interesting.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.720]   And she said, why did you do that?
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.720]   You ruined my life.
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:38.040]   And I, and I said, what are you talking about?
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.040]   I thought it was funny.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.040]   So I shared it.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:44.400]   And she said, yeah, my phone started blowing up with all these, you know, mentions and
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.600]   app replies and morons.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.840]   And she said, please don't do that again.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.840]   Isn't that, but that's very intelligent of her.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.880]   Maybe Twitter is better if you're under the radar.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.880]   I don't know.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.880]   I think she feels that way.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:59.520]   I mean, you can still use it in that way.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.400]   You can still use it as opposed to talk to your friends and so on.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.080]   But a lot of its power is this amplification.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.960]   But so there's two, there's several aspects.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.240]   One is, yes, you're right.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.560]   You, how do you get from yourself is not really enough.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:16.120]   You want it to be that if you say this person is blocked, everyone else who goes to your
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.920]   page doesn't see those.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:24.120]   So the default is that the idiot can scribble on your wall and everyone will see it.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:30.440]   And the people who follow the idiot, that's probably okay.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.720]   But for by default, if you've brought them, why should they be showing up on your wall?
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.240]   That's a sort of control of your space issue.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.240]   So that would be something that--
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.080]   Oh, and this guy shows up on the wall of every sponsor.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:42.760]   And many sponsors aren't sophisticated enough to recognize trolling.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.080]   So then we have to talk to them.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:50.680]   I mean, Twitter is facilitating one person who wants to put me out of business and they
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.680]   do it.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.160]   You know, there's nothing I can do to stop it.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.160]   Is that a good thing?
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:59.120]   No, I think the sooner Twitter goes out of business, the better for the world.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.120]   I think Twitter has been a--
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.840]   I would disagree.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.840]   Twitter has been a--
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:04.840]   Twitter is a force for good.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   Oh, God, I totally disagree.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.400]   I think that I will.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.600]   I think you will come around.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:12.360]   I think in a couple of years, you will come around and realize that Twitter has actually
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.640]   been a very damaging to the college.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:16.640]   I disagree.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.640]   No, so this is--
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:22.080]   The things that make Twitter good and bad are the-- it's just like the internet.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.760]   The same things that make it good are the things that make it bad.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.160]   Well, I'm interested because, Aaron, you had the reaction that when I said--
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.360]   I thought was interesting, which is I feel like maybe I, personally, and maybe others
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:39.040]   will be moving into a post-social media world.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.440]   I'm ready to do it.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.640]   I am kind of done.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   I feel the same way.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:47.760]   And part of it is just because I'm busy with tons of stuff going on.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.960]   And it's hard to pay attention to all that, especially Twitter, because it's @thisperson,
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.960]   @thisperson, @thisperson, @thisperson.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.920]   And at the end of it, it says, "Sounds good."
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   OK.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.200]   That was helpful.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:03.400]   So for me, a lot of my Twitter angst is just the fact that it's just not usable for me.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.600]   I can't share what I want to share.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:10.120]   I can't give a longer description than I want to give to-- or answer somebody's question.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.800]   It's really hard for me to answer questions on Twitter.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.200]   And so finally, I just say, "Could you private message me your email?"
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:20.280]   And I'll be glad to help you out, but I can't do it through Twitter.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.280]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.480]   Google+ was actually a perfect platform for that.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.440]   But it's a perfect platform.
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.440]   But why did it fail?
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:30.040]   Well, because they were late to the game and they couldn't attract the audience and
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.040]   the user.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.240]   Well, maybe this is Twitter is what we want.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.240]   No.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.360]   I think it's what some people want.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.320]   It's not what I want.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.320]   It is.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:42.160]   I think Twitter strengths weigh its weaknesses.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.600]   I know it has lots of weakness.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.200]   Strength is that it is a web-like space.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.040]   I think you're right there, Matthew.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:51.440]   And that's one of the reasons I like it because I like web-like spaces.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:57.080]   But the other thing that-- so that's the first-door effect of the app notifying you
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.160]   and annoying you.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:03.440]   The other thing that's slightly odd about it is that because it amplifies this anger,
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:07.600]   it also seems that when you go and look fit there, the most like thing you ought to see
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:14.120]   is something angry by someone who's got more followers than you or who has tweets more
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.120]   popular than yours.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.960]   And it's like my friends are having a better time than me problem with Facebook, which
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:22.520]   is that you only see the happy things get lots of likes on Twitter.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.160]   You only see the ones that gather lots of reactions.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.240]   And because they have to fight the bad reactions, you tend to see a lot of anger as well.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:33.320]   So it becomes normative that Twitter is the place you go to shout at people.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:39.520]   And there's some value to that in terms of if you're complaining about the government
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:45.440]   or politicians or even if some company has messed you about and you want to shout at
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.960]   them and then wake up their customer service team, there's value for that for the individual
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.840]   and even potentially for the people on the other side of it.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.720]   But it goes very wrong when it's targeted another individual.
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:01.280]   And when it's a normative thing that, as you say, this guy can go around and shout at
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.920]   your advertisers and there's a feeling you can do about it.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:07.320]   So there's a structural problem there because it amplifies that shouting.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.320]   And there's a structural problem.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   It is a structural problem.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:13.120]   The 140 characters amplifies the problem as well because you can't.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.960]   There's no room for nuance.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:21.640]   You have to compose something that's more or less like a bumper sticker or a t-shirt
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   slogan.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.040]   So I ask your wild would have loved Twitter.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:30.480]   And so people who do that well, particularly the ones I follow who are part of weird Twitter
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.080]   or funny Twitter.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.080]   Those great stuff.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:37.840]   Some of them are hilarious because they've refined that to an art form.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:42.720]   But unfortunately it also encourages people to be to distort things and to sort of make
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:49.120]   announcements or pronouncements that are kind of true but not really because there's no
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.680]   room to kind of go into into depth.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.360]   And those don't get any retweets anyway.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.280]   But don't you feel like you're more misunderstood on Twitter than on any other social platform
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   because of that?
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.560]   I have to explain things and it's like, no, that's not what I meant.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.480]   I just didn't have enough room to fully explain what I was talking about.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.560]   And that's it drives me bananas.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.640]   Trying to have to then you have to go back.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   Oh, that's not what I meant.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640]   I meant this.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.120]   And then they it's like, ah, you know, I could have avoided.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.680]   I spent so much time dealing with this.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.480]   I could have avoided the whole thing.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.560]   All of my stuff goes out to Twitter, by the way, I like to use it.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.240]   I like people to follow me wherever they want to or whatever they're comfortable with.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.080]   But I don't like to use it.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.080]   It's a little bit.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:35.880]   It's like trying to communicate, you know, complicated concepts through text messaging.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.440]   So you you text someone, they text you back.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.520]   It's good for things like, Hey, where should we meet up?
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.880]   Or, you know, I saw this cool thing, but it's not good for having long discussions.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.080]   In fact, it makes those worse.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.680]   So if you're having a disagreement with somebody texting is the worst possible thing and Twitter
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.080]   is probably the second worst possible thing.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:01.520]   And I remember my wife saying to our daughter, she was having this text fight with somebody.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:08.280]   She said, get off your phone and call the person over there because texting and your
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.240]   and social media is a great place to start a fight.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.960]   It's not a great place to stop a fight or to reach an understanding.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.760]   Well, the lack of nuance in text really can actually create fights.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.120]   I've found misunderstand misunderstandings and totally.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.600]   Yeah, that is kind of with with my friends.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:33.960]   That's our rule now is say it in person because you lose a lot of nuance on that.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.240]   So I have a good quote from Jack, which I've stuck some.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240]   I saw that.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.040]   And actually is I wonder because it's also a fast company.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.680]   If this is Jack's response to you or if it's is it related, you can only express yourself,
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:54.680]   he says, if you feel safe to do so, you need a sense of income.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.480]   Is this in the context of what he wants Twitter to become?
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480]   Yes.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.400]   So there's a bit of social network as people think about it, he says.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.440]   And this is quite a long discussion of words, what is up to you.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.720]   But that that piece I thought was interesting because he's basically recognizing that there
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.200]   is this problem with people not feeling safe because they get so shouted out and they need
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.480]   to fix that and they're working on that.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.840]   So that's a fascinating thing.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.840]   There's other issues too.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.360]   I mean, half of my Twitter followers are not real, they're spam.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.480]   And I would say that's true of a lot of high especially true of people with high follower
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.360]   accounts.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.920]   And I think that what you're going to see soon is an exodus from Twitter.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.080]   People are being fooled right now.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.560]   They think they're talking to 37 million people when they don't realize that 15 million of
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.800]   those are not even people.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.600]   I think you've actually started to see it already.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.440]   Yeah, I think there's already an exodus going on.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.440]   I think it's going to snowball.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.440]   It has been.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   But Twitter is going to need to rebuild that sense of conversation.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.920]   It can be at its best.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.840]   It's hard to go back as Google learned.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.240]   Once people start abandoning you, it's hard to convince them to come back.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.080]   They're doing all these streaming things too.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.280]   They've just announced that Twitter is going to be on Apple TV.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.120]   I don't want to, the last place I want to do is sit and watch Twitter on my big screen
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120]   TV.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.960]   Yeah, it doesn't feel like they're actually, they want to focus on those things because
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.720]   there's not enough return to it.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:27.760]   They'd rather cut a deal with the NFL or the NBA and stream clips of shows because that's
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.320]   where the money is.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.960]   There's no money in making it a more appealing community for people to trust.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:39.160]   No, but the value, the reason to what is valuable for the TV stuff is that it's, and
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.480]   that's where the back channel does make some sense.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.800]   If you've got a shared conversation about something, that can make more sense and you
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.120]   can make that stuff go here.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.200]   It was the thing that got me back watching live television was the sense that there will
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.480]   be a conversation about it on Twitter that I would want to see at the same time.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.440]   In the same way that we have a chat room here, we're watching us and talking about
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.440]   us.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.120]   You're able to have that for a broadcast show is powerful.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.360]   So I stayed up to the middle of the night to watch the royal wedding because I knew the
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.680]   British Twitter would be really funny.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.480]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480]   There are times when Twitter shines.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.120]   I'm not denying that.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.120]   So there's a key there's a key here.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.000]   It's to that strategy that does make some sense.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.880]   But there are times when you're signing all the content people have put it into put onto
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:24.080]   Twitter to create kind of this zeitgeist zeitgeisty feed of information and news.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.240]   I guess that's a way to monetize it.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.800]   But it's also, you know, it's also the place that you go to talk about the thing that's
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   happening now.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800]   Right.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.880]   Facebook has has like a half day lag about that stuff.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.160]   You won't be having a conversation about what's just happened on Facebook because it takes
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.800]   a while to bubble through the system there.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.600]   Well, it's sort of you can have a conversation about what just happened.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.760]   If it's if it's a news event or if it's a, you know, if it's the the M is or the Grammys
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.400]   or whatever it is, if or even if it's just a TV show that you haven't that happens to
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.560]   be airing and you know, this happens more in the UK than us here because here the TV
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.400]   shows are all spaced out of a three hour gaps.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.360]   But in the UK when Great British Bake Off is on, Twitter is talking about Great British
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   Bake Off.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:08.360]   And top of the pops comes on to what is talking about top of the pops.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.320]   And the subset you see will be the subset of Britain's that you follow and maybe the
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   ones that they retweet if they see some funny ones.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.240]   And it does work as this like parallel conversation stream about what it is you're watching.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.680]   And so I think it is good for those things.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:28.520]   It's not so good when when you're trying to have a nuanced political discussion.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.600]   I try to avoid political discussions.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.720]   There's another reason to get off Twitter, right?
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.560]   I mean, actually bars aren't any good for that either.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:42.040]   So it's not just a matter, you know, you know, you can you can all people often do raise
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.120]   the Arab Spring as an example of Twitter at its best.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.760]   I think you can clearly point to Trump's ascendancy as an example of Twitter at its
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   worst.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.680]   I think he is he is the perfect person for that medium.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.680]   And I think that's an indictment of Twitter.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.120]   And I mean, if you want to get political, he certainly knows how to use it.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:06.160]   He knows how to use it better than anybody I've ever seen.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:12.080]   And in fact, it's a shame because his handlers are bowdler rising his Twitter.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:16.440]   And his the handlers tweets are not interesting in the least.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.440]   They're horrible.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440]   So what are boring?
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   They're bad.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   The analysis.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:25.120]   Yeah, it's the when you see it on Android late night, that's that's the real Donald Trump.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.640]   When you see it daytime and its hashtags and its, you know, it's campaign, you can.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.640]   It's clear difference.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.480]   So the they should link with analysis and kind of found the thing where it's well.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.640]   And then the words used and so forth.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:46.840]   And I think the campaign, whenever you think about Trump, the campaign is completely misguided.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.640]   They should let Trump be Trump.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.120]   And that's what he should be on Twitter.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:55.560]   They shouldn't be trying to because then you get this weird disjoint where no, that's,
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560]   that's him.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.560]   Oh, that's not him.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:58.560]   That's on the same feet.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.560]   Let me try.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.560]   He definitely was.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.920]   He was the first sort of major politician.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.720]   I would say that really got it.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   Oh, yes.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.240]   How you can use Twitter, but but it's all about.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.760]   It's all about reality.
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:17.120]   Twitter was almost made for for this person.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:22.560]   His whole life has been about self-aggrandization, promotion, reality shows were made for him
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.560]   too.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.680]   This is where he shines.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:31.560]   And I think he understands it's the, it's all about the pronouncement and the sort of,
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.240]   you know, just saying anything you want on Twitter.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.240]   Nobody's right.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:38.120]   Nobody's has nothing to do with whether it's true or not true.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.720]   No one's going to notice or care.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.480]   You're still going to get lots of, you know, activity.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:49.160]   And then everyone will be writing about the thing that you said, even, even when it isn't
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.160]   true.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.800]   And by the way, that's where amplification is powerful too, because I think if you, if
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:00.640]   you look at how many votes Trump got in his nomination process, it's still not a huge
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.080]   number of people.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.680]   It's very easy on Twitter to appear to be huge.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.680]   Huge.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.080]   It, it, because it's such a great amplifier.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.320]   Anyway.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.400]   So there's good and there's bad.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.400]   I agree.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:18.680]   And I think the bad outweighs the good, in my opinion, but, you know, you know, to each
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.800]   his own, I'm less than Facebook.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.320]   I is not that interesting either.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.840]   I'm less and less interested in social media in general.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.840]   I feel like.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.840]   Interact with your friends online.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.880]   Well, the thing that breaks my heart is people ask me questions on Twitter all the
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880]   time.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.920]   There is, you know, people listeners, if yours are one, I interact with me.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.560]   I just choose not to use that in that medium to interact.
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.560]   I don't know.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.560]   It's in your, in your sleep.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.560]   It's what?
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.560]   It's in your sleep.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560]   Well, I didn't put it there.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.080]   How do you interact with them?
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.920]   I don't.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.920]   Because I can't.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.360]   My Google Plus is too.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.920]   You should just take those out.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.600]   You know, and a long ago I said I stopped responding to email as well.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.960]   Same reason.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:04.560]   If you got several hundred email messages a day asking things like, well, which phone
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.760]   should I buy?
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.600]   You would stop answering email too.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.840]   You can't reasonably handle that.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.000]   I'd have to hire a team just to do that.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.520]   And it's just as bad on any other platform as well.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.720]   Twitter I was able to do for a while because, you know, it was a small number of people
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:20.720]   that used it.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.720]   It still is.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.720]   But yeah, it's not a very good place to do it.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.840]   I prefer to do it in public because that way I could share at least others.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.640]   You can do it in your own site.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.640]   I should start figuring out something to do a blog or something like that.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.640]   So I've got a question.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.520]   If this group, the four of us were, if the four of us were going to build the
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.920]   ideal social network, the one that would take over the world and be exactly how we wanted,
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:49.880]   what would we include in that social media tool?
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.480]   What would we include and what would we not include based on what we know about Facebook,
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.680]   Twitter, and Google Plus?
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.720]   Because I think there was a lot of good in Google Plus.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.120]   You know, I actually think there was too.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.040]   I really had high hopes for Google Plus.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.040]   I loved it.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.120]   And there were a lot of good things about it.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.520]   It was great looking.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.120]   It was good, especially for things like photography.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.680]   I know a bunch of photographers who used it a lot.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.480]   But it just, you know, you can't start.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.400]   The tray rack is a bit in it.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   You can't start.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.600]   How good you are.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.840]   I mean, dozens of people have started great things long after the not so great thing got
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.640]   going and network effects just kill you every time.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.880]   But, you know, there are other things that have taken off and have got different characteristics
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.880]   to them.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.040]   What would the perfect social network?
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.040]   I think that's a great question.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.680]   What would be the perfect social network?
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.320]   I don't think you can have one.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.400]   I think they have different flavors.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.920]   I tried to do social growth.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.720]   I really like the idea of it being, you know, only like hardcore geeks.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.160]   But the only people I only see Corey Doctorow there.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.520]   It's a great place to follow Corey Doctorow.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.520]   They all appear.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.320]   And that's, and he's not, that's the proxy thing of him as well.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320]   That's his thing.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.320]   You could tell it's not him.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.320]   He's not there.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.320]   Which is, which is the thing that went wrong with, with buzz.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.320]   Yep.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.440]   And that's why Google did not create a right API for Google Plus.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.760]   They learned that lesson on buzz.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.760]   Right.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.760]   But that also made it problematic.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.760]   That also made it worse.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.760]   There was no way to get stuff in.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.760]   Right.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:24.080]   And that's actually what my, to like top of my list is a good API.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.920]   I think they need to have a good API, well documented API.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.400]   Easy to use.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.240]   Allows people to do what they want to do with it.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.600]   It's difficult to do a good API.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.880]   But I think that's top of the list.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.880]   You know, it's the problem with all these things.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   I think that could have changed Google Plus.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880]   Yes.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.720]   That is exactly what Indie Web is about.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.320]   I mean, it's about running the APIs.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.160]   We'd love to see those kinds of things.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.160]   So we've got the micro pub API to allow you to publish.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.800]   That you can then publish out to different sites.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.720]   And we've got the web mention model that lets the site say, I've linked to you over here.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:03.640]   So you can work out what that link means, whether it's a like or a follow or a comment
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.560]   or RSVP or whatever.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.360]   So we've got the models for doing that.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.760]   So we've got the API stuff.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.960]   But the challenge is always, it's still the, you've got to work out how to follow people
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.440]   and give yourself a feed of things and then decide what to see it.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.720]   Then you've got to balance out how crowded that feed gets versus how quiet it is.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.560]   That's a very hard and subtle thing to get right.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560]   Mm-hmm.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560]   But we do know--
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.560]   Google Plus, please.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.560]   --to have all these tools.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.480]   The whole thing with circles and including certain people in certain circles was a great
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.480]   idea.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:37.320]   It was a great idea because you could keep these folks who all only wanted that content
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.480]   in this circle and you could keep people who wanted other things in this circle.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.400]   But it just was too labor intensive, I think.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.400]   It was a great idea.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.400]   Yes.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.400]   But it just took too much fiddling.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.400]   Yep.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.200]   So it's got to be dead simple to use.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.720]   I mean, I think of like Instagram and Snapchat and those things that have kind of disrupted,
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.560]   even though there was existing platforms there, they've kind of disrupted and got in there
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.720]   and been successful.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.440]   I think the network effect is very powerful, as you said, Matthew.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.040]   But I think it can be overcome with the right tool.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.040]   No, you're right.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.040]   And I think we're--
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.040]   Instagram, for example, I mean Instagram was just--
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.040]   Instagram was just--
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.040]   Exactly.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   I think we're--
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.040]   Because it was just one thing.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.040]   Right?
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.040]   It was just a share of photo.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.040]   The end.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.040]   Right.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.040]   That's literally it.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.040]   Right.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.040]   See, my solution to this problem is the right one.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:26.760]   I would try to take all these good things, put them into one platform, a new social media
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.360]   platform and try to get everybody to use it, which probably wouldn't work.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.240]   You'd probably have to specialize as some of these other platforms have done.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.280]   Otherwise, as you say, you never do overcome the network effect, unfortunately.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.280]   And I think if you look at what Snapchat has done, what's fascinating about it is it is
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.000]   nothing like what it started as.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.720]   So they were very smart, I think, in starting with one specific really, really small functionality
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.880]   disappearing messages.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:00.720]   And then that, I think, served a huge need that was not being served, that ephemerality.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.440]   You didn't have to worry about your Instagram photo or your Facebook post living on forever
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.440]   and ever.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.720]   So you could be a little more free, a little more open with what you posted.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.360]   There wasn't so much pressure.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:17.560]   And they've gradually added things to it to the point where it's now this fairly robust
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.120]   kind of media entity.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.760]   How long they'll be able to do that, I don't know.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:27.440]   But that's an interesting strategy to start with one tiny little feature.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:34.120]   I mean, I don't know why we always get in this conversation.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.120]   I don't want to get in this conversation, but Leo net, that's what we need.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.120]   Leo net.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.680]   Yeah, I think the problem with social networks is people.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.640]   Yeah, they're made of people.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:44.760]   And most people are great.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.400]   I love people.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.400]   But there are enough.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.720]   All it takes is, you know, these few.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.800]   I used to say I like certain people specifically.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.680]   I don't like people in general.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.080]   There you go.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.120]   All right, let's take a break and move on.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.440]   We could talk about Amazon.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.440]   We can.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.440]   Yeah, I like people.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.720]   I'd hang with you anytime, Matthew.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.760]   I would hang with you and Kevin Marks.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.280]   I do hang with you Aaron Nukem.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.840]   I'm not against people.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.600]   Just some people.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.480]   And I think really human beings are not.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.280]   I think part of the problem is biologically we're not made for this kind of environment.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.400]   This is not this is too many people.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:42.000]   I'm not sure I buy the Dunbar number of 150, but I think we can handle a smaller number
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.560]   of actual relationships.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.440]   You know, I've always fought this notion because this is what everybody, you know, who hated
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:53.600]   the internet said, but I'm starting to come around.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.240]   So me following 10,000 people and Twitter is a bad idea?
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.720]   I think I followed close to that number.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.600]   But I don't, you know, it's just, it's no fun.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:10.640]   All the funds gone out of it as they as they said of mice and men.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.640]   Our show today.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.800]   Oh, this is fun.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.440]   What is brought to you by a better internet, a better internet would be nice.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.440]   Wouldn't you?
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.480]   How many of you have Wi-Fi that doesn't work or a router that kind of stops working and
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.880]   you have to reboot it?
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:30.440]   How many of you are suffering with buffering are moaning about dead zones?
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.120]   Wouldn't you like Wi-Fi that works?
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.000]   You need this.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.720]   This changed my life.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.800]   I actually was not the I was.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:41.800]   I tried everything.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.480]   I tried repeaters.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.400]   I had power line repeaters.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.840]   I had massive routers.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.920]   I got a second internet connection.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.440]   I did everything.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:58.320]   And then along comes ERO, E-E-R-O and everything just works again.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:05.280]   So instead of the single router model, ERO is a mesh system throughout your house.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.320]   One or more, it doesn't have to be just one, but one or more of these ERO devices, they
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.480]   look kind of like a white Apple TV.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.240]   They're about the same size.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:17.720]   They have a power connector, two ethernet connectors and a USB connector on each and
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.880]   every one.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.360]   You can, if you want, wire all three and then they'll get in a mesh with each other and
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.640]   work with each other or the way I have it, I have one base station and then I use the
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:34.520]   ERO app on iPhone or Android to add additional stations, you know, at problem spots.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:40.120]   Suddenly, my whole house has the fastest Wi-Fi I have ever had.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.560]   There are no more dead zones.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.640]   There's no buffering.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.760]   No buffering suffering.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.680]   It's Wi-Fi that works.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.800]   It's kind of an enterprise grade Wi-Fi system.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.040]   You can set it up very quickly.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.640]   I hate to use that term because I think it'll scare people.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.440]   It is very easy to use.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.640]   Gives you all the power you want.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.760]   WPA encryption automatic.
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:02.920]   You can't not use it.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.480]   I like that.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.560]   It's very easy to manage it using the ERO app.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.240]   The ERO app does some really interesting things.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.560]   For instance, I've got a current bandwidth test that's always being updated so I know
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560]   what I'm getting.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560]   It's kind of slow right now.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:22.640]   Must be something going on in that work.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.040]   Thank you Comcast.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.160]   I can see what devices are on there by name.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.640]   I can actually rename them.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.640]   I can reserve.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.960]   I can do port forwarding.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.680]   A lot of the fancy stuff.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.760]   The other thing that ERO does is really interesting.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.960]   It keeps track of the devices.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.040]   It knows that that's a Roku for instance.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.760]   They optimize the network for the device that's attached to the network.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.760]   That's really cool.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.160]   They also are pushing firmware updates on a regular basis.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.120]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.320]   It's automatically updated.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320]   It looks great in the house.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   I don't have to hide these.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:59.720]   I have them all over the house because there's no antennas sticking out.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.840]   It's very straightforward.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.840]   As it has two ethernet ports, you can connect it to your cable modem as I have and then
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:12.560]   to a switch or a hub and allow yourself to have many, many, many more devices hardwired
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.040]   as well as wireless.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:26.000]   All I can say is this solved a multi-year problem with bad Wi-Fi in our house.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.360]   You cannot pry the ERO out of my hands anymore.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.960]   In fact, maybe I'll take this box home and add some more of them.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:36.200]   That's the other thing you can continue to add EROs as your needs expand.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.720]   We've got free overnight shipping for you.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:42.800]   If you visit ERO, E-E-E-R-O.com and select overnight shipping.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.760]   Use the offer code TWIG, E-E-E-R-O.com.
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.160]   Offer code TWIG.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:56.600]   Right now, ERO, it is an end the buffering suffering with ERO.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.680]   Big fan, really, really big fan.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.000]   You know what else I'm a big fan with?
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.400]   My Echos.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:06.880]   The Echo Dot is back and folks, it's 50 bucks.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:12.400]   I think competition is going to be great because we're going to see the Google Home soon.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.560]   Sonos has announced it's going to work with Echo.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:19.320]   At 50 bucks, this is a great deal.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:25.640]   The reason you want the Dot is because it binds pairs by Bluetooth or hardwire to a better
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.640]   speaker.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.160]   It's kind of the top of the Echo.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.760]   Without the speaker, the Echos speaker is fine for voice and for talking to.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.120]   But if you're going to use it for music, you want a better speaker on it.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:38.520]   So I have this paired by Bluetooth to a nice set of powered speakers.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.920]   50 bucks means I can put more of these in the house.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.800]   I love the Echo Dot.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:49.440]   It along with the Echo Tap and of course the original Echo are huge sellers for Amazon.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.440]   90 bucks.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.440]   Little expensive.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.440]   50 bucks.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:55.440]   Wow.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:57.440]   I'm impressed.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.680]   Apparently, Amazon is also responding to Google Home.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:04.680]   We've heard that one of the things Google Home will do is give you notifications.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:08.280]   At least in the video, a little polite chime when a Google Now notification pops up and
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:12.880]   you can ask the Google Home, what's that for?
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:18.640]   Amazon is according to the Verge, to Circuit Breaker, Chris Welch, bringing spoken notifications
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.120]   similarly to the Echo.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.840]   It's actually, I'm sorry, let's give credit where credit's due.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.800]   This is from Jessica Lesson's very good information.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.320]   But that's behind the paywall.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.320]   So I pay for it.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.160]   But if you don't, you might want to read the Verge's article.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.560]   Any thoughts?
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.440]   So this is just a peripheral for the main one.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.440]   It doesn't work on the same.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.440]   The Dot?
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.440]   No, the Dot can work by itself.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.440]   It's just exactly the same.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.480]   It just doesn't have its own full-size speaker.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:49.480]   It's a little speaker.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.480]   Okay.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.960]   So I can buy this and shout it out and it'll find me things.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.120]   It's exactly the same.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:59.720]   It's just if you cut the top, if you slice the top off of the Echo.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:02.600]   And the reason I like it is because you can have better speakers because I use the Echo
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.560]   for music a lot.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.800]   But I think notifications would be very interesting.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.800]   There's going to be, I love it.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.960]   This is going to be a fight.
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.320]   There's going to be competition.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:19.200]   And that's good news because I think that this idea of speaking to your house has legs.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:27.120]   By the way, if you want it, Echo will also read you a Twitter feed.
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.120]   Just to circle around 180 degrees.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.320]   You can't get Twitter on your Echo as well.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.840]   Yeah, I'm interested to see what sort of Google Home.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.120]   I am telling them.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.920]   I'm really interested in how they play it or how they, because I think there's so much
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.240]   potential there.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:48.560]   They've got so much intelligence in that company and they've got so many other Google
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.960]   services if you're like me that you use.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:56.520]   Just to be able to integrate some obvious things with that and with voice and with, you know,
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:01.320]   a sort of Google Now type, I'm just, I'm really looking forward to it.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.680]   I'm surprised they haven't already.
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:08.520]   And I think that Google's Achilles here is that they haven't been very good about their
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.040]   own devices, about doing their own devices, making their own devices.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:16.840]   Even when they partner with other companies, sometimes it doesn't pan out very well.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:17.960]   And so I think I'm with you.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.360]   I wish they would have done this years ago.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.880]   I've been, I've been, uh, chomping at the bit for Google to come out and say, okay,
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.680]   here's your, here's your intelligent light switch.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.640]   And, you know, they have nests.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.960]   So they have some intelligent thermostats and smoke detectors and things.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.720]   But, um, you know,
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.040]   But Nast, I think was kind of a train wreck, right?
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.880]   I mean, in a lot of ways.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.800]   And that's Tony Fidell's fault, I think.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:44.840]   But I think Tony, uh, Kevin Marks, I feel like you might have worked at Tony Fidell at some
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:45.840]   point.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.720]   No, you're muted, by the way.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.840]   Oh, I know, because there was a plane going over.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:50.840]   The plane go over.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.840]   I needed myself.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.840]   Sorry.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:56.840]   Um, I didn't know, I didn't know Tony Fidell.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:02.240]   And, um, each of the things, another one of those ones that seems to have had a lot of
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.440]   like hype and now everyone's going, what was that about?
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:11.240]   And that in some ways the, um, the echo is a more compelling random piece of hardware
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:16.960]   stuff in the house than light switches and doorbells and smoke detectors.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:23.560]   I think it's the, the, the big benefit, at least talking to people who love their echoes
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.520]   is just the idea of a smart device.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:33.720]   So it's not just a single, you know, a light sweatshirt, a light bulb, your oven.
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:37.720]   It's a something you can talk to, something that can read you things, something that can
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.920]   turn the music on, something that can tell you what the temperature is, someone that
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.960]   can tell you who was started in that movie that you can't remember.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.280]   I mean, those things have value.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:50.320]   Like the real key is, is can you do it consistently?
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.120]   But who could do it better than Google, right?
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.120]   Right.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.120]   Right.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.560]   Which is why it's puzzling that Amazon owns this space, I guess just from a vacuum, filling
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.560]   a vacuum.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:06.760]   Although the Amazon pointed the way maybe Google didn't really know how to handle this until
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:07.760]   they saw it.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:13.280]   So, you know, when they came out with that sort of echo looking Wi-Fi hub.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280]   Oh, the on hub.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.280]   That's what they want to.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.480]   I thought obviously that's a Trojan horse, right?
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.680]   That's what they're going to do is they're going to turn on, right?
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:22.680]   And then, yeah.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:27.720]   What is that is a, that is a Achilles heel for Google, I have to say.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.720]   It is.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.480]   Well, the thing, the thing that, well, there's kind of things here.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:37.640]   The thing that Google has that makes sense to me in this context is the Chrome cards.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.680]   If you can combine those two, I think that's strong.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:44.800]   And Amazon has the fire TV as well, but I do not really have them more together.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.600]   Echo is doing with Sonos.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.040]   So you'll be able to say to echo, play Frank Sinatra in the living room and it'll know
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:55.640]   which speaker, that's exactly what Google should be doing.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.840]   But yeah, if you say play this week in Google.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.840]   On my TV.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840]   On my TV.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.840]   And I've got a Chrome card.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.840]   And they did demo.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.480]   I believe they demoed that at Google I/O.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.480]   That was one of the features.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.920]   And it makes perfect sense.
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:11.680]   And if it can, you know, it doesn't take long for it to work out where the different
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.680]   gadgets are and that works too.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.840]   And I love the Chrome cast.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.080]   I've been using that for.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.840]   I just worry that it will be a fragment as IoT has been all along, a fragmented world
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:27.480]   where nothing talks to anything else very well and it's a pain or to get things to talk,
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:30.760]   you have to really go to extra effort and really become a true geek.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:31.760]   You'll buy them all from one company.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.760]   So you eat each other Amazon.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.760]   Right.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   Well, no, that's going to be the case.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.600]   There's no way Amazon's going to talk to Google's going to talk to Apple.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.600]   They're all going to be siloed.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:46.760]   Inevitably, that's the world we live in now, which is why I support Indie Web because silos
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:47.760]   are bad for users.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.480]   They're good for companies bad for you.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.480]   It's so frustrating.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.160]   Look at your iPhone.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.280]   Kansas call other iPhones, right?
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.480]   I'm sure Apple would love that to be the case.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.680]   Well, their messaging is just like that.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.680]   And they beefing it up, beefing it up.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.840]   And you can't use it with anybody, but we're actually going backwards.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:09.680]   You're going back to the days and your instant messenger couldn't talk to my instant messenger.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:10.680]   It's so frustrating.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.240]   So the other one that's relevant to this was the story about the speech generation that
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:18.360]   says, top of the running order.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.360]   Did you listen to that stuff?
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.240]   Leah, the other one that was really festive.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.480]   Let's play it right now.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.480]   This is where?
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:27.160]   Top of the running or the deep mind link.
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160]   Deep mind.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.880]   Oh, I'm not sure I want to talk to deep mind.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:31.880]   Now I'm nervous.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.240]   So deep mind is--
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:37.320]   This is the Go playing computer, right?
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320]   Yes.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.840]   So it's the London based AI company.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.600]   They did the Go playing computer.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:46.960]   And they've just been replying the same kind of a current neural networks to speech understanding
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.960]   generation.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:51.120]   Oh, so this is going to be better speech generation.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:58.120]   So they built this model that looks at the audio of multiple scales at one.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:03.960]   And so it's like a layered model of the audio where it spans out over time.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.400]   And then they feed stuff into it and see what it comes out with.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.000]   And they've-- they've-- they've-- they've-- they've-- they've-- they've-- they've
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.400]   measurably got better text to speech than the existing text to speech they have there.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.400]   So listen.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.400]   So there's--
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.400]   So listen to the--
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.360]   Tell me what the-- so parametric, concatenative, and wave net.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.200]   These are different ways of using AI.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.440]   They did ways of doing-- generating speech.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:32.000]   So parametric is having something that you give it a bunch of-- like a-- like a synthesizer
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   model.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.560]   And you give it a bunch of parameters and it plays it that way.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.560]   OK.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.560]   Let's play that.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:40.200]   The Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romance and adventure film directed by Randall Kleiser.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   OK.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.200]   Sounds just like Google Now.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.120]   Probably that's how Google Now is doing it, right?
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.680]   Concatenative is we take a lot of samples and join them together.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.680]   So you record some of these points.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.280]   Also-- also what a lot of systems including Google Now is.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.160]   The Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romance and adventure film directed by Randall Kleiser.
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.960]   So that is not fully synthesized.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.360]   Those are real samples but stitched together.
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:03.360]   Yes.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.360]   With a bit of-- with a bit of nuance.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:06.400]   And this is the AI.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:07.960]   This is the AI one.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:12.720]   The Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romance and adventure film directed by Randall Kleiser.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:13.720]   Oh, screw it.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.720]   I'm out of work.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:15.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:16.720]   Oh, crap.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.560]   That sounds just like a human.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.840]   So basically they built a model, they just feed it raw audio samples and it builds this
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:25.840]   hidden model.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:26.840]   Oh, crap.
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:27.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:30.080]   And then they put words into it, their words come out.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:34.000]   So I have enough-- it's enough audio recorded of me that's fully available.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]   Yeah, but they could be clear.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   And freely available on the internet.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.680]   There are hundreds of thousands of hours of me.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.000]   That would be more than enough for them to create a layout.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.320]   Yeah, but they needed something.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:46.920]   I think the training set they gave it had-- it's in the work paper.
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.400]   But it was like 160 voices.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:52.560]   [SPEAKING HINDI]
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.800]   We could play a game, human or computer.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:58.520]   [SPEAKING HINDI]
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:01.760]   It all sounds like Chinese to me, I don't know.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.560]   So how many samples do they need?
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.480]   Let me find it.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:05.480]   Hang on.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.360]   Leo, you could create your own and then just--
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.360]   They feed people.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.560]   So this is the application.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.720]   So if they train the network without a taxi--
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.360]   Oh, how was it 109 speakers?
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.360]   That's not that much.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.360]   That's not much.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.360]   There's nothing much to watch.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.800]   So in other words, if I just--
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.800]   If we can take--
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.320]   They could easily do it with me.
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.960]   Most of our stuff is Creative Commons.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.960]   They can do it.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.800]   Here we go.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.240]   Here we go.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.000]   So if you go down a bit further, they have--
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.080]   This is babbling.
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.640]   Are you want to hear some babbling?
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.760]   This is weird.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:34.760]   Yeah, still.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.160]   [SPEAKING HINDI]
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:43.280]   Do you remember, you might not be old enough to remember.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:45.840]   There was a guy in the '40s who appeared in many movies.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.600]   He was a double talk expert.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.120]   Yes.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.280]   And he would talk and it would sound like he was saying
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.880]   something but he wasn't.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.520]   And that's what this sounds like.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.080]   The recesses.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.520]   There's lots of outficade into the talk.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.920]   It sounds like speech.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.640]   Yeah, this is what my French sounds like.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.720]   We go, [SPEAKING HINDI]
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:06.080]   It's nothing.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.880]   It just sounds like it.
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.720]   But this happens if they just let it--
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.080]   They don't give it any similar--
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.040]   They just generate stuff.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:12.520]   But they've got--
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:13.440]   But human sounds.
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:14.040]   They've got breathing.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.040]   They've got lip smacking.
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.440]   They've got-- not incandescence.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.400]   They've got-- you know what I mean.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:20.840]   They've got--
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:21.600]   Yeah, frozen in the evening.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:22.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:22.740]   Yeah.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:25.160]   So now these are different voices.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:25.720]   Same thing.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.560]   Let's see.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.360]   The avocado is a pear-shaped fruit with leathery skin.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.400]   Smooth edible flesh in a large stone.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.800]   That sounds a little mechanical.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.600]   The avocado is a pear-shaped fruit with leathery skin.
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.680]   Smooth edible flesh in a large stone.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:41.520]   The avocado is a pear-shaped fruit with leathery skin.
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.480]   Smooth edible flesh in a large stone.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.600]   I think I'm in love.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:47.400]   The avocado is a pear-shaped fruit with leathery skin.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.920]   Smooth edible flesh in a large stone.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.560]   Wow.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.080]   Interesting.
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.200]   It's like a one side of the bus.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.000]   The second one?
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.800]   The avocado is a pear-shaped fruit with leathery skin.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.600]   Smooth edible flesh in a large stone.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:57.960]   You know what?
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.520]   That's just personal taste, because I like this guy.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.320]   The avocado is a pear-shaped fruit with leathery skin.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.080]   Smooth edible flesh in a large stone.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.760]   She sounds cuter.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.760]   Right.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:10.240]   That isn't a phrase any of those speakers said.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.160]   I think not.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.320]   They trained it on these 106 speakers of the 44 hours
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:17.120]   from a corpus sample they had.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:17.640]   Wow.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:20.160]   So part of what it's reproducing is also the recording quality.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.560]   You can actually hear the differences in miking there as well.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.400]   Here's music.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.040]   They can also do it with music.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.600]   So this is a music without-- this is the same thing
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.400]   without any information--
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.920]   This is the babbling, but for the music, yeah.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.160]   --the music babbling.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:43.720]   It's kind of like John Cage.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:44.800]   It's very John Cage-y.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.760]   OK.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.960]   And then I presume that they could then give it instruction.
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:51.920]   Although, I love the idea of the computer kind of running,
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.440]   doing its own composition.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:54.600]   Well, yeah.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:57.960]   Well, that's-- it depends on the integration window.
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.840]   So they've said it's only going to face your integration
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.520]   window where it jumps about a bit.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.040]   And they said they could tune it to have a bong
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.400]   integration with this, so it could generate
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.000]   like a four-minute piece or something like that.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.880]   I think we're not far off from Scarlett Johansson, frankly.
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.600]   No, the thing that's impressive about this
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.000]   is that it gives the promise a very good text to speech,
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   but it also gives the promise of being
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.040]   able to replicate someone else's voice fairly accurately.
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.040]   So yeah, certainly your voice will
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.560]   be straightforward to do because you've given
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.720]   the lots of samples.
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:29.280]   The other weird thing is that it will only be what
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.200]   they've got recordings of.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:33.440]   So it will be people in their stageiest, most recorded voice.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:38.520]   But if it's an actor, this will be a way to recreate an actor.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.960]   The other thing is that you may be able to do,
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.000]   depending on how they tune it, to have someone
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.520]   have one person's voice perform and other's voice.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.280]   So take the cadence of one person
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.400]   and then feed that into another one.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:53.200]   So it's very interesting.
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.520]   And again, it's like a lot of these AI stuff.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.920]   They're not choosing what the model is,
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.000]   they're letting it form its own model of what the speech is
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.760]   and in the same way that our brains do.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.240]   And clearly, it's at the point where
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.640]   it's doing interesting stuff.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:10.880]   So this ties back to the Alexa thing
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.040]   in that if it can talk like this,
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:16.760]   it can talk a lot better than the existing ones.
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.320]   And the other part will be that it may be better at doing--
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:25.280]   the way the current ones fall down is with proper names,
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.760]   is that they don't have enough information
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.320]   to render them well.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.960]   So there may be some ability to do that better.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.320]   But this was actually fascinating to me,
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:38.560]   because this is a very impressive piece of something
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:39.600]   coming to fruition.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.040]   I really-- I mean, we knew this would happen.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.320]   It's pretty interesting.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.920]   Are they using all the data they get from Google Voice?
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.840]   Not in this case, no.
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.240]   This was research projects that they
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:55.240]   used some existing data sets, but they certainly could.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:56.920]   I mean, they could-- no, it's Google.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.600]   They could feed the whole YouTube through it
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.760]   and see what that gave them.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:04.120]   So here is Al Kelly, who's the double talk guy
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.920]   on the Ernie Kovacs, very early.
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:07.880]   I know you are all aware of the TV show.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:11.720]   Of the great coverage being done by NBC on the convention.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.760]   By the way, this could be today, by the way.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:15.920]   This is Ernie Kovacs.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.760]   We'll continue, of course, and all of the highlights
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.560]   we've brought to you.
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.000]   I know you've read a great deal about what
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.400]   is happening at the convention, but I'm sure
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.600]   that you would be interested in the technical end.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:29.640]   We have with us tonight NBC's chief engineer, chief engineer
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.080]   Talman.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:37.320]   So this guy did many, many movies over the years.
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:38.880]   And it's actually pretty good.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:41.800]   Talman, I know that the technical end may seem a little boring,
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:44.080]   but I'm sure that you can make it simple enough for all of us
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:48.800]   to grasp just how the cameras will be handled at the convention
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:50.880]   that NBC has planned.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.560]   What is the planning for NBC with the cameras at the convention?
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.000]   Well, Mr. Fide, I'm very happy to say this.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.800]   Now, NBC is not only taking every technical angle,
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.240]   which is going about to bring every convention news at least
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.960]   in every hotel, no corner prize, or whatever
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.520]   there's been a space to give the people a knowledge of what
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:09.040]   has caused, we let go, but also the space,
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.800]   and they will find that at the Grand Forks A, the cops.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.240]   I love it.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:13.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:14.880]   OK, that's enough.
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:17.960]   I just had to play a little bit of it.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.520]   It's a little bit like the Turbois calculator.
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.720]   Yeah, it's so good.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.000]   I had mentioned several times after we heard
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.080]   that Android N was going to be new Ga.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.040]   I'll say new Ga for your benefit, Kevin Marks.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.080]   I don't want to offend your ear.
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:35.160]   New Ga for those of us in the United States.
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.600]   And I mentioned that when I was a kid,
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.160]   I remember going to a town in France.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:40.280]   It was famous for Nougat.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:40.920]   Well, it is.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:42.200]   It's called Montelé Mar.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:46.120]   In fact, if you know the Beatles song, sweet, tangerine,
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:51.920]   Montelé Mar, this is the famous French Nougat town.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.000]   And Google's going there.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.280]   It's only 35,000 people in the Southeast.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:59.440]   France is the world capital of Nougat.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.800]   And Google is going to celebrate with Google France
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.760]   and the Montelé Mar City Council.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.760]   I've been going to have a big party on the 21st.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.520]   All things Nougat will be on display
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:14.680]   plus bug-droid green cocktails, a buffet of local organic foods
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.400]   and activities for the kid.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.960]   But most importantly, Google is going
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:21.720]   to donate an Android statue for permanent display
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.320]   in Montelé Mar.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.360]   Wow.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.120]   I'm sure the French are very happy about that.
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.160]   Yeah, I don't think they like Google that much.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.240]   But I remember going there when I was a kid.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.360]   And that's the kind of thing that makes the last thing a rush.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:39.040]   So it's Nougat?
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.120]   Is it supposed to be Nougat?
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:41.960]   Nougat, yeah.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:42.560]   Nougat.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:43.200]   Nougat.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.320]   Nougat.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.360]   They also-- Nougat.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:52.040]   --ledual, aluminum, and tissue.
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:54.040]   And tissue.
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.080]   Well, how do Canadians say it?
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:56.600]   Say what?
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.600]   Nougat.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.440]   Nougat.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.640]   OK.
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:02.400]   Unless you're in Montreal, then they probably say Nougat.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.040]   I say, delicious.
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.120]   Are you loving-- are you all loving Nougat on your Nexus
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:11.640]   phones?
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.520]   Are you happy with it?
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:16.040]   Well, I've had it for several months.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.360]   I think-- I'm seeing this with iOS 10.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.680]   We're really at the point where it's
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.360]   hard to make a major difference.
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:24.840]   It is hard.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:25.680]   We're kind of--
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.280]   --just standing.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.520]   --the requirements in notifications and things like that
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:28.960]   are good.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:29.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:33.160]   But it's for them to respond directly in there.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.440]   The app switching is good, but we're not
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.360]   remember to use it.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.360]   But yeah, otherwise, it's just another version of Android
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.920]   that works better.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.120]   But there's no like world-shaking part to it, really.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.720]   So you guys are running the dev preview?
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.280]   Because I know it's your Nexus 6, right?
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.960]   I'm either running the dev preview.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.520]   Oh, it's not for the Nexus 6.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.280]   People bring my phone with the previous upgrade
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.120]   and the way to fix it was to install the Nougat.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:02.600]   I think we have the full one, a real one on our Nexus 6
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.160]   P though, right?
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:04.800]   That's not the dev anymore.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.160]   Right.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.560]   That should be the real one.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.120]   Excuse me, the one for the Nexus 6
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.720]   should be coming out in the next few weeks, which
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:11.720]   is what I've been waiting for.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.720]   Because I always-- I have a special upgrade part.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.320]   Because I'm rooted and all that stuff.
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:18.680]   I have a special upgrade process that I have to go through.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:23.840]   So I have to wait for the official AOSP release
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.120]   before I do that.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:31.840]   I feel like you're right, though, Leo, that phone technology--
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:35.160]   what else can you get?
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.880]   So you've got two cameras.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.840]   Maybe a phone will have three cameras.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:41.240]   Well, that's how you lie the way Intel solved the problem of,
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:43.640]   oh, we can't go past four gigahertz for ships.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.560]   Oh, we'll just put more chips in.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.000]   That'll make them happy.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.560]   And maybe I have rounded corners on your screen,
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:50.360]   or maybe you'll have--
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:52.040]   Let's put it in two cameras.
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:54.840]   It feels like a lot of it is just fiddling hands.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.320]   I call it fins on a cattle.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.320]   Yeah, fins.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:57.760]   Well, no.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.400]   I mean, putting in more cameras and microphones
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:01.600]   does make sense, because you can do more things with it.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.600]   No, I think that you're-- I mean, look at the Echo.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.240]   The Ray Mike's and Echo and the Echo
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:07.120]   are quite impressive what they're doing.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.160]   So there's that sense of it.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.840]   The other thing is-- so part of it is,
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.680]   Apple is doing a bit of the synthetic aperture stuff,
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:16.160]   but they're only doing the two lenses of next to each other.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.360]   If you think about the VR stuff and you say, OK, I'll have a lens.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.360]   Here's my phone.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.120]   A lens here and a lens here.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.200]   Suddenly, you've got a stereo-spotted thing to look through.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.920]   If you take the-- that lens and align it with the lens
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:31.400]   on this side, then you've got the ability
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.360]   to take a spherical thing that way.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.400]   So I suspect we're going to start soon thinking
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:39.560]   about those issues of, OK, we'll have multiple lenses on the camera
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:40.920]   and turn them on in parallel.
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:44.680]   And the obvious ones are making these ones back and forth
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.040]   the same, making these ones symmetric.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.920]   And then you could do the focus trick that Apple is doing,
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.240]   but you could also shoot stereoscopically.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.360]   So we're going to see a bunch of these coming out
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:58.240]   as the lens is-- as the-- as basically, the cameras
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.080]   are already cheap enough.
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.960]   It's about getting enough bus bandwidth
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.200]   to have multiple streams enough CPU to combine them.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.680]   The most interesting sort of theory I saw about Apple's AirPods
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:13.360]   was that they're going to start becoming the sort of control
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360]   center for your phone.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.680]   It's serious in them.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.120]   Sure.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:17.760]   Exactly.
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:18.200]   Exactly.
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.080]   And I don't mind-- I mean, I will look like an idiot with little
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.000]   drool-druly, you know, spit coming out of my ear.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.560]   Those microphones really look stupid.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.400]   But I would wear them all the time if it had enough functionality.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.400]   It could be used as a hearing aid.
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:33.760]   It could use music, but you could communicate
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.200]   because it's the ultimate wearable.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:38.800]   I think this is ultimately what Apple's plan is in the long run.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:42.200]   But it feels as if it makes sense to you a little better, right?
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:43.160]   No.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.360]   But the-- so what is the-- to me, the reason Alexa works--
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.160]   I'm sorry, Echo works--
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:51.480]   is because I don't address anything.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.320]   I address my home.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.640]   I just speak wherever I am.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.160]   It listens and responds.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.400]   And that's kind of what you want.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:01.560]   And if you got used to, and I'm sure Apple would hope you
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.960]   will do this, wearing your AirPods all the time,
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.400]   you could have the same thing.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.200]   I suspect that's where we're headed.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.160]   I don't think this current generation quite does it.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.480]   Five hours of battery life for one thing is a problem.
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:18.400]   Although, as I pointed out, if you alternate ears--
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.160]   You could go longer.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.240]   Well, it's actually attracted to me because when I'm cycling,
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.800]   I often just have one earbud in.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.800]   So I want to be able to hear the traffic as well.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:32.800]   And I'm just doing a podcast.
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:34.280]   I'm not trying to listen to music.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.600]   So I'm listening to somebody talking one ear while I'm
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:38.120]   listening to traffic with the other ear.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.400]   So that would actually make some sense in that--
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:46.240]   So if you're looking on ways to innovate on a smartphone,
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:50.400]   the ways are in things like wearables and stuff
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.480]   external to the phone-- I guess cameras.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:55.160]   I mean, there's going to be a lot of growth in cameras
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:59.000]   because you have a supercomputer attached to sensors.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.120]   There's a lot you can do.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.320]   And that's also a project tango, right?
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:08.360]   Although, I guess that phone's delayed now, right?
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:09.360]   That's a little disappointing.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.640]   Although, I'm not sure I care about mapping out
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:14.200]   my living room, particularly.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:16.840]   They'll have to show me how that's going to be of benefit.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.600]   I can see why a store would do that.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:21.400]   In fact, we're going to pay 700 bucks to have somebody do
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.000]   the 3D photos of the new studio.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.720]   So when you do Google Maps and you get here,
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:27.640]   you can walk inside and walk around.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.560]   That's really worth it, I think.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.640]   So you could use VR for that?
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:33.680]   Yeah, and you would, right?
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:35.720]   If you had Coke, if you had cardboard, you could do that.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.400]   Yeah, you could be--
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.040]   You could do VR.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.160]   And we've done that before.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.640]   We did the very first show.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:40.280]   We did out of here.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:46.320]   We used it Osmo, which is Nokia's $60,000 3D camera
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.280]   to stream the show for people who wanted to.
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:49.160]   They could look around.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.480]   They could be in the studio.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.400]   I think it's limited.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.280]   After a while, I got to take this off.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.320]   Here's some scary news from Bruce Schneider, security god.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.040]   He works as CTO of Resilient, an IBM company,
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.360]   he's a fellow at the Berkman Center and a board of EFF,
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:04.800]   a board member of EFF.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.640]   Someone over the past year or two
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:09.880]   has been probing the defenses, he writes,
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:13.360]   of companies that run critical pieces of the internet.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.160]   These probes take the form of precisely calibrated attacks,
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.000]   designed to determine exactly how well these companies can
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.080]   defend themselves.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.240]   And I, parenthetically, I think it's against a DDoS.
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:27.320]   And what would be required to take them down?
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:29.200]   We don't know who's doing this, but it
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:31.840]   feels like a large nation state China or Russia
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.160]   would be my first guesses.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.680]   And the reason they know it's a nation state
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:41.600]   is the volume of packets that's being sent against these.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.840]   And it's probes because they're not sustained.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:47.720]   They're just trying it out and seeing what happens.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.160]   One week with the attack would start
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.600]   at a particular level of attack and slowly ramp up
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.160]   before stopping the next week.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:54.840]   It would start at the higher point and continue
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:57.160]   and so on as if the attacker were looking
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.600]   for the exact point of failure.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.520]   This goes hand in hand with the news
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.600]   that two Israeli men have been arrested
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.840]   for running a DDoS for higher company.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:12.360]   For as little as $30 a month, you could DDoS anybody.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.120]   You don't even have to know what you're doing.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.080]   You just hire them.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.200]   VDoS was their name.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:18.800]   And you could DDoS anybody.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.680]   With fairly significant DDoS's.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:24.080]   And we're talking attacks ranging from 10 gigabits per second
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.000]   to hundreds of gigabits per second.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.160]   They, I guess they commandeered a network.
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.600]   They had set it up and they were selling it.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.880]   They had a place list and everything.
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:34.480]   - And they were running in the public domain?
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.520]   They weren't running on blacknet or darknet,
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:37.560]   whatever they call it?
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.480]   - They had all sorts of interesting kind of strategies
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:45.480]   to get paid and how to work it.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.400]   Although Brian Krebs writing and Krebs on security things,
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:52.960]   they've earned an excess of over $600,000
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.520]   of the last two years.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.840]   This is a capture of their website.
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.440]   How do I purchase a VDoS plan?
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.160]   This is very web 2.0.
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.520]   The bronze is $19.99 a month.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.960]   Silver is $29.99 a month.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.120]   Gold is $39.99 a month.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:11.160]   And then if you want to go for the VIP $200 a month.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.520]   They call it booter, but it is essentially DDoS.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:17.400]   And of course, they took, yeah, VIP service.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.560]   - Sounds like a great service.
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:22.000]   - Of course they took a Bitcoin because why not?
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000]   But they had all sorts of other ways to handle this.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.640]   And what's scary is that it's barely even a script kitty.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:32.320]   Anybody could hire these guys for as little as $30 a month.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.160]   - Wow.
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.040]   - And DDoS.
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:37.520]   - Scary cool feature.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.160]   - Yeah, pretty neat, huh?
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.400]   They use servers rented in Bulgaria.
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:47.880]   The rest actually was preceded by a hack,
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:50.720]   which revealed a database of customers
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:53.720]   numbering in the tens of thousands.
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.280]   Krebs' website after publishing his story.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:00.720]   Guess what happened to Brian after he published that story?
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.360]   DDoS, 140 gigabits a second.
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:07.000]   You know, the first rule of Fight Club,
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.840]   you do not talk about Fight Club.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:15.160]   - Thank you for sitting on VDoS.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:18.600]   - Let's take a break and wrap things up with any picks
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:23.600]   or stories we didn't get to or anything you want to talk about,
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:25.720]   we will give you all three a chance to do that.
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.920]   Kevin Marks, indyweb.com.
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:29.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.240]   - Yes, indyweb.org.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:32.080]   - Damn it.
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:32.920]   - Damn it.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:33.760]   - Do we have to go?
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:34.600]   - I'm wondering.
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.840]   - You should try, see.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.400]   I mean, who else would have it?
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:39.160]   (laughs)
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:43.920]   Really, Matthew Ingram, always a pleasure from fortune.com.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.920]   Senior editor over there and of course
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:49.520]   our good friend, Aaron Newcomb from Floss Weekly.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:55.720]   And we're pleased to see Russell Randall came back this week.
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.760]   It was the two of you and I think you took the lead,
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.400]   but it's really great to see Randall back in fighting form.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.960]   He spent a lot of time in the chat room too,
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.080]   which is great, I think a lot of people.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.760]   - Yeah, yeah, it was really good to have him back.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:11.640]   He's doing great for those that watch Floss Weekly
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.920]   and he'll be back running the show next week.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:17.560]   - So it's getting a little intestinal distress
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.880]   that actually caused a more serious collapse
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.800]   and was hospitalized for a couple of weeks.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:26.440]   So he's, but he's always all better now.
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.480]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:31.080]   from Quick and Loans,
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:34.520]   bringing the mortgage process into the 21st century.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:37.880]   Fast, easy, it's completely online.
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.920]   And I think Quick and Loans figures,
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:42.160]   anybody who watches this show, that's what they want.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.480]   They don't want to make a trip down to the broker's office
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.600]   with a box of bankers, box full of papers.
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:51.080]   They want to be able to submit bank statements and pay stubs
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:52.280]   by just pushing a button.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:54.280]   They want to get a quick turnaround time
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.320]   and that's exactly how Rocket Mortgage works.
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:00.800]   All the complicated, time consuming parts of applying
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.560]   for a refire or mortgage are gone,
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.560]   no more searching through stacks of old files
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.400]   or paperwork.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.960]   In fact, you can do it all from your couch
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.720]   'cause Rocket Mortgage works on your phone
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.560]   or tablet as well as on your computer.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:14.280]   And you will get approved in minutes
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:18.960]   because computers, and it's a custom solution
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:22.480]   that fits your needs exactly at Rocket Mortgage.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.280]   Now go to quickandlones.com/twig
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:29.720]   and find out more quickandlones.com/twig=housinglender.
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.800]   License in all 50 states,
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.160]   nmlsconsumeraccess.org number 30, 30.
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:40.920]   And we thank Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:41.720]   for their support.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:44.440]   This just in from CNN,
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:47.000]   the Republican National Committee has been hacked.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.560]   (laughing)
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.440]   - No, but there are no secrets anymore.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:55.480]   We'll see if WikiLeaks publishes that database,
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.740]   wouldn't be surprised.
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:00.200]   Aaron Nukem, what are you up to these days?
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.880]   Anything you'd like to share with the people?
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:03.960]   I know you've got the great Benetia Maker Space
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:06.480]   under your belt and that's working great.
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:07.320]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.000]   So, you know, as most people know, I am a maker
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.640]   and that's why, and also, you know,
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:14.240]   Jeff usually has a number and he's not here.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.600]   - You want to do a number?
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.600]   - I take over that role.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:19.240]   Usually I do a project, but I've got so many things going on,
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:22.280]   they're all about halfway done as usual.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.480]   So instead of doing that, I thought I'd do a number.
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.320]   - Okay.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:26.880]   - The number today is 10 million.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.400]   10 million.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.160]   - 10 million, okay.
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:34.400]   - And it turns out that's the number of computers
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:37.240]   that Raspberry Pi computers that have been sold
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:38.920]   since their inception. - Is that mind boggling?
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.480]   - That's amazing.
[01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:43.320]   - There's a picture there of the Pi Zero, $5
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:47.800]   for a half credit card size computer.
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.520]   So I use those all the time.
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:53.000]   - 10 million units, I think that's my opinion.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]   I'm sure even in the gang,
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.200]   just never thought it would be this like this,
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.120]   this is amazing.
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:00.240]   - Well, in fact, I think he even said, you know,
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:02.800]   their highest expectation at one point was 3 million.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:05.720]   That was their, not their stretch goal.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:07.160]   Like that was their dream goal.
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.920]   Like I can't, you know, can't even imagine selling 3 million
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:12.960]   and they've exceeded that by 3X plus.
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:15.720]   So they're doing really, really well.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.320]   I recommend them all the time.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.040]   What amazes me is that they've been able to pull this off,
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.480]   not from a hobby standpoint,
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:24.200]   because these things are obviously interesting
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:26.000]   to people like me, you know,
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.480]   you can just reach over and pull off your computer
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:31.320]   and take it with you, you know, put it in your pocket,
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.720]   whatever, it's a lot of fun.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:37.480]   But they've brought this out really to educators.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:40.920]   They've also got distributors and resellers
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:44.640]   who are selling this thing without any margin,
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:48.200]   which is I think unheard of.
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:50.840]   I don't know of anybody else that sells things
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:51.680]   without any margin.
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.160]   The reason they're able to do it is
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.680]   'cause there's a lot of other stuff you need
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:57.440]   to go with it that does have high margin.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:00.200]   But even at that, you hardly ever hear of anything
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:02.280]   being sold without margin.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:05.160]   So I mean, I think they've just done a fantastic job,
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.560]   all credit to them.
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:10.080]   And if you haven't tried one out, go pick one up
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:11.120]   'cause they're awfully fun to use.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:12.680]   - I agree.
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:14.640]   And there's so many projects you can do,
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:17.880]   so many great things we talked on security now yesterday,
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:20.680]   how you could do a VPN with a Raspberry Pi.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:24.880]   It's just incredible, highly recommended.
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:30.160]   And congratulations to the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:31.840]   Remember in the early days,
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:34.120]   they could barely make enough to keep up.
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.200]   I mean, they really didn't have the supply down.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.760]   Now they can crank them out.
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:38.600]   That's great.
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.960]   - Yes, especially the normal size pirates.
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.120]   It's now version three.
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:44.040]   - You figured it out.
[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:44.880]   - Yeah.
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:45.800]   - They're able to crank those out pretty well.
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:48.800]   And the zeros for a long time, you couldn't get 'em,
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:49.920]   you couldn't get 'em, you couldn't get 'em.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:52.280]   And now you're able to at least get one at a time
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.640]   from several different places.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:57.520]   So they're catching up on the threes.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.560]   I think that at $5 there's probably more skin in the game
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:04.440]   for them to get the $35 one out there
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.200]   and in people's hands than the $5 one.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:09.280]   But boy, it sure is a powerful little platform.
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:10.120]   - Hmm.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.760]   Another number from our own Patrick Delahanty.
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:13.680]   He did some research.
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:17.840]   There are 15,400 shows publicly available
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:20.160]   in the Twit database.
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:23.600]   And if the average show length is two hours,
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:24.840]   well, let's even make it one hour.
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:27.040]   There's plenty of Leo.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.240]   - If you build a bot.
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:31.680]   - To build a bot and Google, if you wanna be my guest,
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:32.880]   I could retire early.
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.440]   It wouldn't be that hard.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.360]   Just ran about Twitter every week, right?
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.200]   That's all you have to do.
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:39.040]   Matthew Ingram.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:39.880]   - That's a different bot.
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:41.800]   They'd have to do, you should do makeup
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:43.320]   or clothes media around.
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:44.840]   - Leo Rhett bot.
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:48.440]   Matthew Picker, a tip or anything you'd like to share
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.840]   with us, a story at least?
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:52.480]   - There was something interesting actually
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:54.320]   was in the lineup.
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:58.360]   YouTube launching a community tab, I thought was interesting.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:00.240]   - Yeah, and that's just started now, right?
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:04.920]   - Yeah, so it doesn't sound that fancy really.
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:08.120]   I mean, so you get a tab where you can kind of connect
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:12.040]   with your viewers and you can share more content
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:13.160]   and interact and so on.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.720]   But I think that could be a really,
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:19.520]   just a great tool for lots of people
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:22.200]   who spend a lot of time on YouTube comments
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:25.280]   as we know on YouTube or Flaw.ps.
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:27.480]   I mean, they make Twitter look fantastic.
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:30.160]   - So I'm looking at my channel.
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:32.320]   Is this the discussion tab or is there actually
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:34.200]   a new community tab?
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.560]   - I think there's a new community tab.
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.920]   - Okay, so not everybody will have it yet.
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:41.080]   - Yeah, I don't know that it's gotten rolled out yet.
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:46.160]   But it got, if you know the Vlog brothers, the Greens,
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:47.840]   it was developed with them.
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.680]   They've done a really amazing job
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.520]   of connecting with their community and building all sorts
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.840]   of things on top of that.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.680]   Yeah, I think it's something that YouTube
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:59.600]   has kind of not really devoted a lot of time to
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:00.440]   in the past.
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:02.880]   And so it's interesting to see that happen.
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:05.160]   - So there it is on the Vlog brothers site, I guess.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:07.560]   That says community, yeah.
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:09.160]   And anybody can participate.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:11.880]   - Yeah, and so instead of having to have your own site
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:15.000]   or your own blog or push people to your Facebook page,
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.840]   you can do it all inside YouTube.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:19.200]   - So is it Google+ shaped?
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:20.680]   It looks a little bit plus even.
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.680]   - It does look a little bit like that.
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.520]   - There's, let's see, you got comments.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.920]   So you can make a post and then there's threaded comments
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:29.840]   after it.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.240]   You can vote it up or down.
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:35.480]   Yeah, it does kind of have that feel to it.
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:36.920]   This is the addition though, right?
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:39.200]   Google+ didn't have the thumbs up, thumbs down thing.
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:40.040]   - Right.
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:40.880]   - That's great.
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:41.800]   That's kind of Reddit style commenting.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:43.320]   It's really more like Reddit, isn't it?
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.160]   - It is, yeah.
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.160]   - Yeah.
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:46.200]   It's gonna be interesting.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.560]   - Yeah, and they're getting great engagement here.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:51.800]   Hundreds, in some cases, thousands of comments on a single.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:53.080]   - Well, those guys are legendary.
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:54.440]   - Well, yeah, of course.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:55.840]   - They're the kings of community.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:59.920]   And that's, you know, if you, we've learned anything,
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:01.360]   that's the key to success.
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:03.000]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.840]   - Not build an audience, build a community.
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:07.400]   - I remember one of the brothers,
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:09.200]   which one writes the books?
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.640]   - It's a hanker job.
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.040]   Anyway, he read, I think it was a chapter
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.800]   of his upcoming book.
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:19.800]   This was a couple of years ago.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.560]   And just did a YouTube,
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:23.680]   here's me reading part of the chapter.
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:26.360]   And the book hit number one on Amazon.
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:27.800]   It hadn't even been released yet.
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:28.640]   (laughs)
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:31.160]   - And by the way, before anybody kind of,
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:33.120]   and I would be tempted to do this,
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:36.560]   dismisses this as UI YouTube, so what's.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.720]   There's a whole generation.
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:40.160]   This is how they get their news effect.
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:42.440]   If you look at the blog brothers,
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:45.960]   understanding the tax plans of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz,
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:49.280]   668,000 views, understanding the primaries,
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:51.120]   465,000 views,
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.280]   Benghazi explained 800,000 views.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:57.280]   These guys have bigger constituencies and audiences
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:00.040]   among young people than the networks.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:01.380]   - Yeah.
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:05.960]   And my daughters who are 20 something and 18,
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:07.960]   that is one of their go-to,
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:09.960]   they've got certain specific YouTubers,
[01:57:09.960 --> 01:57:12.160]   they go to for different types of news,
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:15.920]   some of it is political, some of it's cultural or pop culture,
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:20.920]   but that is, it's a huge, huge part of their media consumption.
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.640]   - Yeah, boy, that's pretty impressive.
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:24.440]   They've made a series of videos
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.000]   how to vote in every state.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.400]   So they take seriously their responsibility,
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:30.480]   which I think is great.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:34.640]   Wow, wow, that's kind of an eye opener.
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:37.400]   - Thank you, Matthew.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:39.000]   How about you, Kevin Marks?
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:39.840]   Let me guess.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:42.040]   - Theweb.org.
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:45.400]   - Theweb.org, there's a home group website
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:47.760]   club tonight in Sunnyvale,
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:51.080]   next week in San Francisco, Brighton and places.
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:54.680]   And the weekend after that,
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.160]   not this weekend, the weekend after,
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.880]   there's actually a camp in Brighton,
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:00.560]   which is the full weekend.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:01.880]   - Oh, fun.
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:02.720]   - I can do a great bright.
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:03.560]   So there's that coming up.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:04.960]   But I wanted to show you a little thing
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.040]   that I had to get an indie web thing
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.600]   I wanted to get a this week.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:11.440]   So if you go to, are you running Chrome?
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:12.480]   - Yes.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:14.560]   - Okay, but install the plugin.
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.120]   - Okay.
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:17.360]   - So that is to Chrome.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.600]   - All right, actually Carson's doing it.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.760]   Let me do it Carson at this side.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:26.400]   So I have to go to get that link.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:30.600]   It's in the, I'm sure it's in the notes here.
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:31.520]   So let me just.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:34.160]   - This j.mp/indyme.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:35.160]   - Oh, that's easy.
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:40.160]   - J.mp/indyme.
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:42.760]   - M-E-I-N-D-I-E-M-E.
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:43.600]   There you go.
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:45.680]   And then I'm gonna add that to Chrome.
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:47.560]   Okay, verify me.
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:48.760]   It's been added to Chrome.
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:50.000]   Now what?
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.600]   - So now go to kevinmarks.com.
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.720]   - Okay.
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:55.320]   Oh, 'cause you've been verified.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:58.400]   - So what this is is distributed verification.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.240]   - Yeah.
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.360]   - So you see my little links on the right there.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:02.360]   - Oh.
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:04.040]   - These little green things that are appearing
[01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:07.760]   is it checking that those places link back with the Realm-E.
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:10.000]   So-
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.520]   - So it's looking like this is Realm-E.
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:13.520]   - It's looking for Realm-E.
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:15.120]   - You see if a link's with Realm-E on them,
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.360]   then it's going and loading that site
[01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:18.920]   and see if they link back with the Realm-E.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:20.960]   And then because it's a browser plugin,
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:22.480]   if you click through to Twitter,
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:25.400]   you will see the verification,
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:26.240]   the other way.
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:27.240]   So you've clicked through to my Twitter.
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:28.800]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:30.400]   - And it's scroll down so you can see the link
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:31.960]   on the side.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:32.800]   - Oh!
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:33.640]   - Check.
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:35.400]   - And the really modifying existing pages
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:38.640]   is not something, I mean, that you have to do.
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:41.200]   - So, but the Realm-E's are already there
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.680]   on lots of sites there on Twitter and WordPress
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:48.080]   and GitHub and, you know, known.
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:49.480]   And lots of other spaces use Realm-E
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:52.920]   'cause it's a standard we put together 13 years of,
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:53.760]   something like that,
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:55.760]   for saying these sites are both me.
[01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:59.360]   So what I realized was that we can actually do
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:02.520]   verification this way in a very distributed way.
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:04.400]   'Cause if my site's linking to that site
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:05.760]   and the other site's looking back,
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:07.640]   then that's clear it is the same person
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.160]   or at least the person who controls both the sites.
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:10.200]   Maybe they've hacked all your sites,
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:12.000]   but, you know, at least it's,
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.040]   it's not someone saying I'm Leo, look,
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:16.160]   I'm linking to your site
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:17.680]   'cause when the link back doesn't show that.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:18.720]   It doesn't show that.
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:21.240]   So yeah, if you go to twitter.com at Leo Laport,
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:23.600]   it links to Leo, the link that links back.
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:25.440]   You get a green tick on it.
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:27.480]   - Yeah, I just went to my key base page.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.440]   Unfortunately, I'm getting red X's on everything.
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:32.360]   I guess I have to add some Realm-E tags.
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.040]   You have to add Realm-E links back.
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:36.600]   And part of the problem is that some sites
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:38.680]   really late have one link.
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:42.160]   So it works better if you've got,
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:43.200]   you know, if you've got a central hub
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:44.560]   that you link everything to.
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:47.960]   So like Twitter and GitHub will only have one Realm-E link.
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:52.080]   Whereas Google+ will let you have an arbitrary number
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:55.520]   and other sites will let you have more.
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:56.360]   - Okay.
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.200]   - So, but the point is--
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.920]   - It did do it on Twitter though,
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:01.100]   'cause I guess I must, Leo, Leo, Leo,
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:01.940]   and he's like, "Well, that's, you know why?
[02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:03.600]   "'Cause that's with known."
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:06.060]   - Yeah, so no one has done properly.
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:06.900]   - Yeah.
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:07.740]   - Yeah.
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:11.200]   - But, you know, I made this,
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.260]   'cause I suddenly realized, hang on,
[02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:14.680]   when Twitter was talking about the verification thing,
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.440]   I thought, "Well, we've had this verification thing
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.700]   "for a while, we just don't show the check marks."
[02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.620]   So I made the browser show the check marks.
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:22.740]   So now you can see, it's the season is weird.
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:25.980]   If I had it works on, well, it should work on
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:27.680]   new social and things as well,
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.180]   assuming they've actually marked up the pages,
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:31.100]   not then, or generate the JavaScript.
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:34.780]   - Yeah, I have to get twit.tv to rel me and tech.live.
[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:39.780]   So that is a meta tag that doesn't appear in the page,
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:43.340]   but it appears in the HTML code.
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:45.540]   What should that rel me be?
[02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:48.300]   - Yeah, so if you view source on one of the links,
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:50.700]   well, what if you saw one of mine?
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:54.180]   It just, A-H-ref equals the place you're linking to,
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:56.700]   rel equals me and put it there.
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:57.700]   And it's put in by default,
[02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:00.380]   as I say, by Twitter and GitHub and Google+
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:01.940]   and a lot of sites already.
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:04.620]   - Good, I'm glad to hear that.
[02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:05.460]   They're more--
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:08.020]   - But this is basically distributed verification.
[02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:11.180]   So you get little check marks next to places
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:12.180]   that have actually verified.
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:13.860]   But I may turn off the red ones eventually
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:15.980]   'cause they're kind of obnoxious.
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:17.500]   - That's fine, rel.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:20.220]   So you see all of these.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:22.220]   - They're mostly at the bottom.
[02:02:22.220 --> 02:02:23.060]   I think they're at the bottom.
[02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:23.900]   - Should the bottom set?
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:24.740]   - Here's a rel me.
[02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:27.020]   All right, let's keep looking.
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:28.220]   There's gotta be some more.
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:30.580]   There's 21 of them, so there's a bunch of them.
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:33.020]   There we go.
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:33.860]   - There we go.
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:37.540]   - So this is your kind of your link list.
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:41.100]   And you see the rel equals, quote me, quote,
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:42.620]   next to that link.
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:44.740]   Just to say, that's my site, that's my site,
[02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:46.140]   that's my site, that's my site.
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:47.340]   - And then each of those sites,
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:49.540]   I've done the same thing and done a link back.
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:54.140]   So if you went through to my blog or Flickr or whatever,
[02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:55.500]   the link back is there as well.
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:58.100]   And it'll show the check mark the other way as well.
[02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:01.540]   So the point is it's mutual linking,
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:03.100]   but it's a way of doing verification
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:07.060]   that doesn't require one central site to hold the key
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:08.300]   because it's distributed.
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.340]   - Yeah, so that's kind of why I use Keybase.
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:13.500]   Keybase of course also keeps my PGP key,
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:18.500]   but Keybase has a kind of a much stricter verification thing.
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:21.180]   You have to be able to modify the DNS of the site
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:22.940]   in order to verify it.
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:24.300]   - Which is more work.
[02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:25.980]   - The point about this is,
[02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:27.340]   just to modify the HTML.
[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:30.020]   And actually, many sites would do this by default
[02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:31.540]   because it's a sense willing to do.
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:33.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:34.340]   Awesome.
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:35.180]   Hey, thank you guys.
[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:36.020]   What a great show.
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:36.860]   What a lot of fun.

[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:47.300]   Thank you Matthew.

[02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:15.700]   or wherever else.
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:16.820]   - Wherever else you want.
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:19.300]   - And I'll also be filling in for Father Robert.
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:20.180]   Well, he's away.
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:21.340]   - Oh good. - On KnowHow.
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:22.160]   - So, - So, - You're our new
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:23.000]   - KnowHow guy.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000]   - I'll be on KnowHow.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.380]   And so, if you're interested in some of the projects
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:27.820]   that I've done in the past or talked about,
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:31.140]   like my Raspberry Pi sprinkler project,
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.180]   I've also done a res,
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:35.780]   I've done a Android, homemade Android security camera.
[02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:37.180]   We're gonna be talking about those on KnowHow.
[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:39.300]   So, check those episodes out when they come out.
[02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:40.360]   - Nice.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:41.860]   And Kevin Mark's always a pleasure.
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:45.940]   Thank you for bringing us your garden once again.
[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:47.940]   Indieweb.org. - It's pretty quiet, stay here.
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:50.500]   - Yeah, except for that one plane.
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:52.100]   We'll see you real soon.
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:53.880]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday,
[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:56.800]   130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 20, 30 UTC.
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:59.320]   Jeff and Stacy should be back next week,
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:00.760]   but I won't be.
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:01.840]   I'm going on vacation. - No.
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:04.040]   - Who's gonna host the show while I'm gone, Carson,
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:05.360]   do we know?
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.880]   Is it Jason?
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:08.400]   Probably Jason.
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:09.960]   Yeah, Jason, how I'll be here.
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:11.400]   And so, we'll Stacy and Jeff.
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:13.000]   And I'll be back a few weeks,
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.400]   hence I think October 11th,
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:16.880]   which is my return day, about a month from now.
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.360]   (whistling)
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:19.200]   How does he do it?
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.600]   I don't know.
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:23.060]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:23.900]   Bye-bye.
[02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:26.480]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:29.060]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:31.640]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:36.340]   [dramatic music]
