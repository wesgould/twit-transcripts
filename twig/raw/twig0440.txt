[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   It's time for Twig. This week at Google Jeff Jarvis is here. Stacey Higginbotham is here.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.300]   Lots to talk about, including new pricing plans for Google Fi, the Google Culture Gallery.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.200]   It's all the rage you won't believe who Stacey looks like.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.100]   And why you can't search for gorillas in your Google Photos.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.200]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.200]   Netcasts you love.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.200]   From people you trust.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.700]   This is Twig.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.200]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   This is Twig. This week in Google.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.700]   Episode 440 recorded Wednesday, January 17, 2018.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700]   Shugu Guru Lyman Van Vliet.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.700]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, the show where we cover the latest news
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.700]   from the Google verse.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700]   Well versed in Google Jeffree Jarvis.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700]   Professor of Journalism at CUNY.
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.700]   He's even written a book about Google called.
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700]   What would Google do? What would they do?
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700]   Buzzmachine.com. Is it out of date?
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700]   I mean, is Google app operating the same way they did when you wrote the book?
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.700]   I actually think they are pretty much.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700]   They become a mobile company. It's the main difference.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700]   Yeah.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.700]   Yeah. I mean, and every company has to change, but there's also the DNA, the heritage, the way the company was founded.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700]   It doesn't change much.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700]   And also joining us, I don't know who the hell this is.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.700]   It looks, well, Stacy's been kidnapped.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.700]   The lower third says Stacy Higginbotham of Stacy and IOT.com.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.700]   But you're telling me that's not permanent, the blonde hair.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.700]   It is a wig.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700]   If you want to wear my purple one next week.
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700]   She says so too. I really like it.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.700]   I really like it.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.700]   What do we think about Stacy as a blonde?
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700]   I think I like you as a brunette, but I'm just used to you as a brunette.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700]   I'm both.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.700]   Yeah, you say blue.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.700]   She's a blue net.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.700]   Yes. I'm a blue net normally.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.700]   I kind of have two colors in my hair.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:17.700]   You know, this actually ties into the first story of the day because the viral hit of the week is this Google Arts and Letters app that everybody's going.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.700]   All the kids are going crazy about.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   That takes a picture of you. It's been out for months. We've known about this for months, but all of a sudden it was discovered.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.700]   Thank you, Instagram, for making it a hit.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700]   Didn't they add a new feature?
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.700]   It wasn't the matching was a new feature for this app.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.700]   Okay.
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:42.700]   So what you do, and you've not done it, but I'll just give you an example and maybe a cautionary word of warning.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.700]   This is what I did.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700]   I did this.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.700]   I can't remember which shade I was doing.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.700]   So that I'm just warning you.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.700]   The results are not always flattering.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.700]   So what happens is it takes a picture of you and in the app, it's a little hard to find.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   I'll help you do it in a second.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.700]   And then it goes through its vast arts and culture collection of artworks and comes up with what it is using face matching technology.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.700]   What do you think, Jeff? Is that a pretty good likeness, you think?
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.700]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.700]   I saw it on the mystery.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   I got one.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.700]   Did you get one?
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.700]   Yeah, I got one.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700]   You don't look like the beard.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.700]   That looks like Abe Lincoln's secretary.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.700]   No, it's a nose and I got another guy with the beard.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.700]   Of course.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.700]   Google can't see my face because I'm actually a ghost.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.700]   I feel like there's a side view of this guy.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:41.700]   In a way, this one of me was good because it reminded me that even though I don't feel like an old man, apparently I am.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.700]   I did it earlier.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.700]   I was just thinking that this guy is probably my age, right?
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.700]   It's Charles Wellington first.
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.700]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.700]   Sir George Grove, the painter is Charles Wellington first from the Royal College of Art and Music.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.700]   And he looks a little like Ben Franklin.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.700]   He does.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.700]   He just identified my guy as an older gentleman.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.700]   Older gentleman.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.700]   This is beyond.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   So are you ready, Stacey?
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.700]   I can't because Texas is the other state.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.700]   Oh, that is so says the chat room.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.700]   So you can try it.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.700]   This is in Illinois and Texas.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.700]   Illinois has a state law.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.700]   What the what that says you can't do biometric facial recognition.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.700]   Can she say permission for it?
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.700]   I mean, she seems odd because obviously a lot of what like if you have an iPhone 10, you're doing it.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.700]   If you post a picture to Facebook, you're doing it.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.700]   Does it is Facebook for it in Texas?
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.700]   No, but so this is a privacy aspect.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.700]   So the iPhone does not share your face with Google's or Apple's AI efforts.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.700]   So that's what this is about.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.700]   Facebook has been sued by Illinois attorney general.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.700]   Okay, because this is exactly what Facebook does.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   So, yeah.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.700]   Oh, they've sued a lot of people.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.700]   Illinois has argued with Snapchat, Shutterfly, United Airlines.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.700]   This is like a strange law.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:23.700]   Maybe it wasn't written correctly, but I mean, if you choose to do it, yeah, you should be able to do it.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.700]   Yeah, but Google isn't exactly upfront about like when your friends like check out this cool app.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.700]   It's not like Google saying the app could stop and say, you know, you're doing now.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.700]   Well, how stupid do you have to be not to understand it's uploading your picture to Google?
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.700]   So it can search.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.700]   I mean, it's kind of...
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.700]   Okay, that is a very high bar.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.700]   There's a lot of people who don't understand what's happening.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.700]   Okay, just say it.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.700]   So there is a article in the Houston Chronicle, if you're really interested by a good friend named Dwight Silverman,
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.700]   how to get around the block in Texas and Illinois.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.700]   It just turned off location, basically.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.700]   iOS settings, privacy, location services, and just turn it off.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.700]   Or you could use a VPN.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.700]   I was going to say I could do a VPN, but I'm not really that excited about that.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.700]   Not that worthwhile.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.700]   Next time I'm in California, I'll see.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.700]   To prove that it's possible, Dwight did it.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.700]   He's in Houston.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.700]   And he looks exactly like in a portrait of Baron Samuel von somebody or other.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.700]   I'm just, you know what, I'll be honest with you.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.700]   None of them are that spot on.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.700]   No, there was this thing.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.700]   You're just listening to it.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.700]   All people standing in museums.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.700]   Stop it.
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.700]   You're doing that just to get me annoyed.
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.700]   What you doing?
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.700]   Especially since I can't do it and get some sort of...
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.700]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.700]   You're safe.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.700]   You're safe.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.700]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.700]   Stay safe.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.700]   Go ahead.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.700]   What were you saying?
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.700]   Mom, Dad.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:03.700]   There was a meme of people standing next to paintings that looks like them.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.700]   That was actually good.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.700]   Oh, let me see if I can find it.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.700]   You have to...
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.700]   That's a lot of work.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.700]   You have to go find it.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.700]   There we go, yeah.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.700]   You can leave your house.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.700]   Images for people standing next to paintings.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.700]   Go ahead and look.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:23.700]   I searched for people standing next to paintings that look like them.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.700]   I just understand what I want, Google.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.700]   Oh, that would probably be illegal in Illinois.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.700]   It would be a violation.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.700]   It would be a violation.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.700]   There's a few of them here.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.700]   There's like one or two of them here.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.700]   There's a guy with the guy on the top there.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.700]   That's a pretty good one, except for the...
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.700]   That's a pretty good one.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.700]   It teaks shirt.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.700]   That's a good one.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.700]   That's pretty good.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.700]   The bald guy.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.700]   The balding guy is good.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.700]   Those are actually the people in American Gothic, just so you know.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:56.700]   But Ken Tucker, who used to be the TV critic at "Empa Weekly," gave him American Gothic,
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.700]   and he does look like it.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.700]   It's hilarious.
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.700]   So...
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.700]   I don't know exactly why I'm getting these.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.700]   Well, I think it's Google search.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.700]   It's mixed in with the meme.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.700]   Here's...
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.700]   Jesus, I'm sorry.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.700]   It's a male man Johnny.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.700]   Did it?
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.700]   Oh no.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.700]   Should I not scroll any farther?
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.700]   Oh, I'm sure it's fine.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.700]   It's cool.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.700]   I'm sure.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.700]   What could possibly go wrong?
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.700]   I think it'd go wrong.
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.700]   Did you receive search on?
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.700]   I think the top...
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.700]   I should turn it on.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.700]   There's no others.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.700]   Monet does not look like his water lilies.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.700]   I just want to say...
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:36.700]   Oh, there's a guy in a night thing in a night's armor with a white beard.
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.700]   That's funny.
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.700]   He's posing...
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.700]   He's in night's armor, posing next to night's armor.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.700]   No, no, there's night's armor, and he's in a sweater.
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.700]   Oh, I don't see that one.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.700]   Okay.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.700]   I got a different one.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.700]   That's the filter bubble we all live in.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.700]   It is.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.700]   Mr. Barack Obama mentioned in his interview with David Lanterman on Netflix.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.700]   I watched it.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.700]   How was it?
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.700]   I don't watch it yet.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.700]   He talks about the filter bubble.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:03.420]   In fact, the only controversial thing that they said at all was that we live in two different
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.420]   worlds.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.420]   Many of us, people who watch Fox News aren't in the same world, the people who watch CNN
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.420]   or MSNBC.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.420]   He said it.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.420]   He said that, and that was fairly controversial, but then he talked about the filter bubble,
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.560]   and he said, "If you and I search for the same word on Google, we'll get different results
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.260]   because Google tailors are results to you."
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.600]   And so he talked about that filter bubble issue.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.340]   You have, this is from Eli Parriser's book, and you have...
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.340]   I've debated here.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.340]   I've debated here.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.700]   You had debated this and said, "I've come around to your sense."
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.820]   Although it is true that we tend to hear what we want to hear and surround ourselves with
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.380]   people who say what we want, especially politically, but in every respect who think the same way
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.380]   we do.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.720]   The beauty of the internet is you stuff still leaks in.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.080]   Yeah, but I'll come around a little bit too.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.680]   I've been arguing, they have said this on the show, that I think the Facebook's greatest
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.880]   opportunity is to introduce us to people we don't know, make strangers less strange.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.280]   And the filter bubble is not an information filter bubble, so much as a human filter bubble,
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.280]   where we just don't...
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.280]   There's not enough diversity.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   Right.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.280]   Simply put.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.720]   And Facebook's an opportunity to encourage greater diversity.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.440]   I wrote a...so after the Facebook changes, which I'm sure we'll discuss, I wrote a post
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   about the changes themselves.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.580]   And then today I put a post about rethinking the definition of community, because I realized
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:31.700]   that I think Facebook and media define it far too shallow and temporally, where if you
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.440]   get into a conversation with somebody, somehow you're in a community.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   No, you're not.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.520]   A community is where you're joined together with people in membership around something
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.360]   in common, a need, a concern, something.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.880]   And that's not what Facebook enables the world to make.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.880]   It could be.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   And I think it's a place they could go.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.880]   And neither media.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.160]   So then when you have those communities, then you kind of identify with who you know and
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.840]   who you are, then you need to be able to meet people who aren't like you.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.760]   Then you need to find the value in that.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.480]   So is Facebook's coming change, which is to disconnect itself from publishing.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.360]   And really put stuff from your friends and family in the feed.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.800]   Not express that way.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   Okay.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.760]   Tell me what they're doing.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.440]   They're, they are emphasizing family.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.800]   They are de-emphasizing external content in general.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.640]   That doesn't mean that they will de-emphasize news, especially if your friends share it.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   I'll see that.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   If I share it.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   New York Times.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640]   You'll still see that.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.960]   And I, you know, and also if you follow a group that has news in it, you'll get a lot
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.960]   of news.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.760]   But this is, so this is a news story, but it's shared by a friend.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.880]   And in fact, what's nice about all of this is this is all friends now.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.160]   And that is very different.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.640]   It's not, Lisa did.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.280]   I've always said that Lisa reminded me of a strong, powerful black woman.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.280]   I think that's true.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.200]   And apparently so Google feels the same.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   So does Google.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.360]   Same way.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   I don't know.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   Do you think that looks like Lisa?
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   It's interesting.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.360]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.280]   See, this is why Facebook's new thing is good.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.680]   It's people we care about and friends and family instead of brands, right?
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.840]   You used to say that your feed was all me and I noticed I'm not in it once now.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.040]   So that's why you like it.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.120]   Oh, I did.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.040]   I unfollow you.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.480]   Oh, this show is full of truth.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.640]   I'm trying to remember.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.640]   No, I don't think I.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   I don't think I.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.640]   You're right.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   Where's Jeff in my feed?
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.640]   Have you not posted this week?
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.640]   Oh, of course.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.640]   Of course I posted.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.640]   That's interesting.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.840]   I usually get a lot of.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.840]   Yeah, because you don't.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.760]   Well, you know why I get a lot of you because you put your Twitter feed into this.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.160]   Oh, I wonder if we cut that out.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160]   Oh, there's your Jeff.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.040]   But yeah, this is Twitter.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.040]   This is Twitter.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   Let me make sure it's Twitter.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.040]   Okay.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   You're still.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.440]   I'm not snoozing you or anything like that.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.360]   Oh, they're twice in a row.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   That's good.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   See, this is why I think I get a lot of Jeff.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360]   I get Jeff.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360]   I get it.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.440]   It comes in spurts.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.440]   So these are tweets.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:20.720]   Yeah, that would be interesting if Facebook were to do that, deprecate auto posts from
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   Twitter.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.720]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.120]   Well, they did for a while a couple of years ago that they discouraged it.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.040]   And so I stopped cross posting and I would try to post them both.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.240]   It was pain in the butt and then it apparently changed.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.440]   And I will sometimes go into Facebook and kill something I did on Twitter so I can do
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   it appropriately to Facebook.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.120]   You know what I do?
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:49.760]   I use Dave Weiner's thing called Radio3.io.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.040]   And so it's a bookmarklet.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.200]   And when I see a story that I want to, really I'm bookmarking it for the shows.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   Shows.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.320]   So I use this.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:05.800]   I bookmark it and then it posts to Facebook and Twitter.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.040]   But this part, the top part is the text.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.560]   And then there's the link and underneath it, both on Facebook and Twitter, you know how
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.440]   they do that, that snippet from the actual page.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.640]   And this works, I think, quite well for me.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.440]   And then it also goes to Pinboard, which is what Karsten uses to build the run downs.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.000]   Kristin builds it.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Oh, Pinboard.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.040]   Well, and I have a further, and I'm like, what?
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.040]   Yeah, we use Pinterest for all of our editorial.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.960]   No, I have a further thing, which actually is Karsten's idea worked quite well.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:47.080]   I then use Zapier, which is like, if this than that, steroids, to put it in a Google
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.040]   spreadsheet called Leo's links.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.800]   And he can go to Leo's links and it's the same format as the rundown.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.200]   So he can just copy along.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.520]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.520]   That's plain stuff.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.520]   Nice.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.080]   Next time I'm there, I want to see that.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.760]   No, I just, I don't actually, Karsten brings order to your brain.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   Yes.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.800]   I, well, it's, the order it's in is chronological for me without reference to show.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.040]   I used to tag it with the show, but unfortunately Dave's tool doesn't allow me to do tagging.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.600]   So Karsten, you just go down from Leo's list and populate what you think is relevant to
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.840]   a lot of his own stuff too.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   I like this.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.280]   You actually, look at this, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.520]   You tweeted something.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.680]   I also bookmarked, which is Joel on software's.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   This is all related.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.320]   Joel Spolsky, who we would be doing.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   You pooed in.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   I would.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.320]   But I liked it.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:48.200]   He's, his New Year's resolution was to give up reading Twitter and Facebook.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.560]   I said it on the show last week.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   That's the new.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.360]   I don't have a TV.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.040]   Well, you know, the time I didn't have a TV, actually, I was also happier.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.800]   In fact, if I just would live underground with it.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.900]   And then when you got the TV, you only watched TVS.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.900]   I, I, I don't have a correction, by the way, Obama did not compare Fox to CNN or MSNBC.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.960]   He said, people who watch Fox News get a very different worldview within the people who
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   listen NPR.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.720]   And that is absolutely.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.480]   That's totally true.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:22.320]   My, my father watches Fox News all the time and he is, his vision of the world is terrifying.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.560]   Like he just, every other, yeah, it's American carnage.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.240]   It's the American carnage channel.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.880]   So, you know, I've, I've, one of the things, by the way, people say, Oh, don't talk politics.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.240]   This is not about politics anymore.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.800]   It's what media we may disagree about politics.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.920]   I'm probably more conservative than either of you.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.120]   That's not what we're talking about here.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.080]   We're talking about an aberration in the world, not about politics at all.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.280]   I mean, I, you know, well, anyway, but that's what I'm saying.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.280]   Let's talk about this.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.960]   Joel Spolsky, you think that I like his bird cage liners because that's what we used to
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.480]   call the newspaper, right?
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:07.560]   And he says, uh, and he's, you know, his point is Twitter and face, Twitter more so
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:14.640]   than Facebook, but both are kind of designed to foster outrage and flames.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.680]   And when you read them, he says, I feel bad.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.080]   So is media.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.600]   That's all the news media designs.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.200]   That's why I don't watch sensationalistic television programming.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.680]   Well, in the news media, that's, I mean, there's, there's the front page, right?
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.960]   But then there's also like the feature section and there's nothing puffier than the feature
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.960]   section.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.120]   I mean, that's all like, even there, even there, there's, there's kind of what, what
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.600]   bad things could happen to you.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.040]   It feels more like nightly news.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.360]   I've done it.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.920]   I was a tablet and I'm not a fan of that in any form.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.840]   So when I, when I feel bad, because I, you know, when I tell my mom, stop watching so
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.120]   much CNN because she, she won't even fly anymore because she's so scared.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.400]   And I don't like that.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.480]   So I kind of do kind of get those inputs out of my life.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.160]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.000]   Why is this case wrong with that?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Just needs to be clear.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.320]   I said, Oh, I'm in the business.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.320]   I wasn't doing that in a hardy way.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   I was, I was doing that actually.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.320]   I actually did it.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   He actually did it.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.760]   No, no, I, I was like.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.760]   I also was in the business, but.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.240]   Yeah, I was talking about that.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.040]   But you weren't in the sensationalism business.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.480]   I was not saying I was in the business.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.480]   You're in the business.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.400]   I was in the bad side of the business.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.960]   I worked for the New York Daily News doing page ones.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.960]   I was on magazine.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.400]   Oh my gosh, your headline brain must be awesome.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.800]   Did you write your own headlines?
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   I got there after.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.920]   I got there though after the brilliant days of the Daily News.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.440]   But I somewhere in my basement, I have a page one of Donald Trump on it that talks
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   about him being the leading up the years losers.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.840]   You got mad.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.280]   You know, it's funny though, what I realize is he gets mad, but he also loves it because
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.640]   the most important thing is the attention more than anything else.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:06.440]   Here are the, here are the iconic Daily News covers starting in 1919.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.800]   It was a tabloid, Germans block signing of treaty.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.760]   Uh, who lost and stopped.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.840]   It's not getting really well actually that's getting a little sensationalistic.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.520]   Look at the woman on the phone.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.560]   Uh, lost and stock collapsed 10 billion.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.840]   That's a Japan at war with US.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   Next photo.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   Oh, I have to, what is this?
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.840]   What is this?
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840]   An ad?
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   It's over in Europe.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   Oh, wow.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   Maryland dead.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   That's sad.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   We carry on.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.840]   That's a great cover.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   Uh, and a famous picture of John John saluting the president's casket, flagged up casket as
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.280]   it went by in the funeral courtege.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.280]   In 1963.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.080]   It was a, these are not their, their headlines that we remember.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.800]   Those are just big events and news.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.040]   Well, maybe we haven't gotten forward to city.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.080]   That's, now that's, now we're getting into the, this is now we're getting the 70s.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.280]   We're getting a little bit into the feisty.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   Uh, you're right though.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.720]   Oh, this is more straightforward.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   These are like hard news, hard news.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.680]   Say you got to go to New York, New York Post and I went, I just, I Google daily news,
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.440]   famous daily news covers, but I guess that was the wrong one.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.360]   That's, I didn't get the, this is from the daily news.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.800]   They don't want to really celebrate the, uh, yeah.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.120]   See, you can't go to the daily news for those.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.840]   Oh, you know what you go for?
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.160]   Google image search.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.200]   Now, now you get the good stuff.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.240]   Arrest weirdo in Tate murder is, is that was the news.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.960]   It said, uh, headless body found in town.

[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   That was the post.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   That was the post.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   Oh gosh.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:51.040]   Some of these, I don't want to look at, you know, they're too depressing.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:59.280]   Fidel Gastro dictator reportedly okay after stomach surgery.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280]   This was a famous one.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.480]   I never forget this one.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.240]   Got him.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.800]   So what was, what was your favorite headline that you wrote, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.320]   Oh, God, I can't remember.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:15.560]   I can tell you, I can tell you my people magazine headline that I like best.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.560]   Yes.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.560]   Shoo goo goo.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.560]   Rood.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.680]   Lyman Van Vite cures tattered tennis toes with sheer stick to it.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.080]   Oh my God.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.000]   I love that.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.800]   What does it even mean?
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   There was a product called shoe goo.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   Yes.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   To fix.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   Tenies.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   And they did a feature story on them and I wrote the headline.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   Shoo goo.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   Rood.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   Lyman Van Vite.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.840]   Cures tattered tennis toes with sheer stick to it.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   To this.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.720]   I use that for a announcer trial.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:54.520]   Now on when I, when I am practicing my microphone technique, I shall, I shall proclaim Shoo goo
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.120]   goo lime and van Vite.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   Clures cures tat.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   You can't even say it.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.200]   Shoo goo goo lime and van Vite cures tattered tennis toes with sheer stick to it.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:12.360]   This is nice.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.360]   Oh man.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.360]   There it is.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   Oh, you found it.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.720]   Shoo goo goo lime and van Vite cures tattered tennis toes with sheer stick to it.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   That is a great.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.640]   I thought it was tennis toes.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   How did.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.920]   I had Sally chorus the person who wrote that article feel about your headline.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.760]   I have no idea because if they want she was the reporter.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   Right.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.760]   So I was the writer.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.920]   That's important to people.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.880]   And I think it's even more important in this day and age when people don't read articles
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.880]   they just share them because of the headline.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.880]   The headline is often written by another person, right?
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.880]   Not anymore.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   No.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   Not in the magazine.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.880]   Yes.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   It was back in the day.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.960]   Not even the newspapers and magazines I think headline writers are still separate, right?
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.360]   In print digitally.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.000]   No.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.920]   So it fortunate if you're doing someone will do your headline.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:08.040]   You're every writer has to come up with three headlines and then many of them gets taken
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   out.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.440]   Yeah, because I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.200]   The headline is the most important part of the whole article from the point of view social
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   sharing.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.960]   Yeah, I did.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.960]   We also had a person who did our they would actually write the tweets.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.520]   They had like two social media people who would.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.200]   Oh, so strange.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.680]   The process was whack, but they would actually write the tweets and write Facebook stuff.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.440]   They, the reason it was whack is because they had like a timeline.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.720]   So like if you had breaking news, they would stick it in the timeline, but then it wouldn't
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.000]   get tweeted out for like hours.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   So that just.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.160]   They had a queue.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.520]   Yeah, they had a queue.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.800]   And they that we had rules about what got tweeted when and how fast it was ridiculous.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:04.160]   So Jeff, you wrote a medium article on what you think about the changes.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.320]   Let's let's let's let's break this down.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:15.560]   You say, yes, I'm worried Zuckerberg says he's going to prioritize posts that spark conversations
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.000]   and meaningful interactions between people.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.920]   That doesn't necessarily mean what the headline said, which is going to deprecate news articles.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.720]   No, it actually doesn't.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.320]   So what is he going to do?
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.920]   They believe they they've bought the research internal and external that's sitting and staring
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.560]   passively at content, including especially videos is where they hear they had all these
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.680]   publishers pivot to video watching passively watching video.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.960]   They think that's bad for you.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.440]   So they think that that interaction with your friends is good for you.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:55.480]   We read that we read that study from Facebook when it when it came out a few weeks ago,
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.880]   you know, it was a little self serving.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.360]   They said it's bad for you to just passively consume content.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.920]   It's good for you to share.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.080]   And this is the this is in effect, Mark, putting this into action.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.920]   But by the way, I also saw that Facebook's engagement numbers have been going down for
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.920]   two years.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.720]   So this is also there's an argument that this is this is a long play to try.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.480]   To try to fix the experience and have a happier experience.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.080]   I even read somebody said this is the beginning of the end for Facebook.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.040]   Oh, well, that's a wonderful headline.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   Everyone would click on that.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.400]   It's no matter what it says.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   Well, I think it was.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.840]   Let me see if it was in the Monday.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.840]   Let me see.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.600]   This is Frederick, a fool writing in the money.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.760]   That's Frederick.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.520]   I think he said this is the beginning of the end.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.680]   Maybe he was it him or somebody else somebody else said that.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:57.760]   It's a good it's a good article and it's clear it is not it is not a sensationalist piece
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.760]   by any means.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.960]   None of what I didn't write.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.480]   Here's here's the core problem I learned in conversations that I've had through my CUNY
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.080]   gig with Facebook people.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.480]   Facebook had two giant buckets of content.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.120]   One was social content, the stuff that they are now going to promote.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.960]   It was your friend talking to your friends and your families and your cats.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.320]   And the other was everything else so called public content.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.080]   And the problem was that quality New York Times, Washington Post, Twitter, whatever got
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.400]   thrown in with crap.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:32.280]   And in the view of Facebook, it was all just public content.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.920]   And I think that's what got them in trouble.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:39.800]   I think that's what enabled people to game it and for the crap to rise so much and for
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:46.920]   the quality not to and and because they didn't want to do something that neither Google nor
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.520]   Facebook wanted to do, which was to judge quality.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.120]   Google has now said, as we talked on the show many, many times, Ben Gomes, that of search
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.760]   engineering now says in search ranking, they will judge quality authority reliability.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.600]   Facebook's got to deal with that devil and figure it out.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.520]   So in a way, what I said in the piece is that I fear that they're going to throw out
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.480]   the journalistic baby with the trolly bathwater.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.360]   But by trying to get rid of the stuff that's getting them in trouble, they get rid of a
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.120]   lot of good stuff.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.960]   And my hope is, and I still have hope that they'll do this, is that they can bring back
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.840]   in some of the good stuff and still promote that and we'll see.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.200]   I kind of agree with you that this is the wrong thing to do is to react to what got
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.760]   them in trouble.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:32.240]   The right thing to do would be to react to falling engagement, a lack of interest among
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.040]   people under 25.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.560]   That's going to be a problem in the long run.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.480]   And how Facebook makes people feel.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.000]   I mean, if they have, apparently do research, it shows that certain kinds of content and
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.280]   passive consumption make people feel bad.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.200]   All of that's the right thing to react to saying, oh, we're in trouble because of fake
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.560]   news is the wrong thing to react to, I think.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.120]   Which is why I wrote the second post that I wrote today and I'm not trying to get myself
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.920]   more clicks.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:03.520]   But if you define community merely as conversation, that's too thin and shallow.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.680]   And that's what gets us in trouble.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   That's where the crap is.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.240]   You're Facebook might do instead.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   So Facebook said they want to spark conversations and meaningful interactions between people.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:19.040]   I say I'd prefer them to be meaningful, lasting and trusting interactions among people plural.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.800]   Imagine a Facebook where they enable you to start your own rotary club to improve your
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:29.600]   community or your own church or your own AA or your own classroom or your own.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.680]   Can't you do that with mutual support society?
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.880]   It's kind of can a little bit, but it's not designed for that, right?
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.640]   It's designed for I share this and we talk about it.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.200]   And media likes that and Facebook likes that, but that's not real community.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   What a people.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.000]   If Facebook means it, what do its customers want?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.440]   Well, I look at meetup as an example, right?
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:55.040]   And I think Scott Heiferman built very quietly built something that had great power in saying
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.720]   that people still want to get together around common interests and not yell at each other
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.960]   and do things together.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:08.840]   And there's a lot of gnashing of teeth that since our parents got old, the rotary clubs
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:15.000]   and the Kiwanis clubs and the bowling leagues and all that have gone away.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.360]   And I think there's an opportunity for Facebook to bring some of that back as meetup is done
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.360]   in person.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.600]   But meetup is about meet space.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   It is.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.400]   As is the rotary club.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:31.240]   Can you do that kind of meaningful engagement online with people or does it have to be in
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.240]   a real world environment?
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.920]   I don't think that has to go ahead.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:41.200]   So I think very successful online communities can emerge, but they're usually highly curated.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.120]   And they're usually built organically around some sort of either content that people are
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.160]   excited about.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.160]   Think about like IRC or the boards are used to frequent or now even comments on certain
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   blogs.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.880]   There a community actually does build up there.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.440]   Is Reddit an example of what you might imagine?
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.680]   The parts of Reddit can be.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.000]   So I mean, you can't just say all of Reddit, right?
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.120]   There are supportive, lovely parts of Reddit.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.320]   And you get to choose as a Reddit user, you get to choose where you go on Reddit.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.440]   Obviously there's bad places on Reddit, but.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.960]   But like, what was her name?
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.520]   Blog, Bloggis, was that her name?
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.800]   I can't remember your age.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.520]   I can't remember mine.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.520]   I don't know.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.520]   I think.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.520]   No.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   Hold on.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.600]   Sounds like how many syllables?
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.880]   I think it's the blog.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.880]   It is the blog.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   Okay.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   The blog.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   Yes.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   Yes.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   The blog.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.880]   Yes.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   Okay.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.880]   So that's a good example.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   Yes.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.680]   So she came online with a point of view and she manages to find a real community that supported
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.680]   her and that supported each other.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.040]   That's kind of old school blogging, isn't it?
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.120]   Well, that's just an example from the past.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.200]   So I just, that's what I look for.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:10.440]   And I think like to get there though, you do have to have a highly curated, motivated
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.080]   people even think about something like the toast.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.720]   That was an amazing community for three years.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   That was awesome.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.440]   Well, and that's part of the problem.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.520]   And we see that happen in Reddit.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:25.360]   We see it happen on Facebook is that there's something corrosive about being on the internet.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.120]   People try to game you.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.440]   We get trolls.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.880]   You have to constantly, massively curate it.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.040]   And even then, look what happened to dig the gaming practically kill it.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   I did kill it.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.120]   Did kill it.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.960]   So there's something corrosive about being on the internet, isn't there?
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:49.400]   Yes, because it's easier to, like the barrier to trolling is so much lower, right?
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.800]   I mean, there's always been people who think it's fun to send hate mail to people and
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.800]   all that stuff.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.000]   It's just much easier now.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.320]   When you have a meat space meeting, if somebody's acting like a jerk, yeah, they push them
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.160]   out and it doesn't happen that often, frankly.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.080]   Well, you have more signals to give.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.800]   You have more, you know, it's like a cocktail party, except without the booze, you know?
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.080]   It's hard to do an internet to accomplish things.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.520]   It's hard to do an internet community.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.160]   But I have been on many and watched them all decline bit by bit, like the well.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.000]   It started for me with the well.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.360]   Well, what I'm trying to say is this, Leo, the well was built around having a community
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.040]   as if community was kind of a generic as opposed to say, well, the well was like, well,
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.360]   it was built around community.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.040]   The well had groups.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:41.200]   And so like if you were a deadhead and you went to the deadhead group on the well, I
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.640]   think I had groups or maybe you would just, I can't remember how that worked, but it
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.320]   was a wonderful community, but it was like using it before it.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:56.200]   You'd follow these news groups, but in almost inevitably it would descend into flame wars.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.560]   Oh, what I'm saying is here's what I'm trying to say.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.040]   Those were built around interests or content.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.040]   Yes, that's correct.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:09.480]   As opposed to being built around an accomplishment or a cause, a rotary club existed to make
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.960]   the town better.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:17.040]   A union exists to get us our rights, a political movement to get exists to get something done.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.440]   AA exists to give support to people.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.800]   The problem is that I think that both media and Facebook have to highly of content of
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.000]   this notion that, oh, community is that which gathers around what we do.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.760]   No, community is gathered around people's needs and their lives and serving those needs
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.680]   and committed with the mechanisms to serve those needs.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.000]   I think we have to turn around our definition.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.720]   That's why I'm saying our entire definition of community.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.920]   I think it's too shallow.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:46.920]   Are we trying to take meat, space and shoehorn it into the internet?
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.480]   You could accuse me of doing exactly that, but I think that there, you know, I saw somebody's
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.560]   post today and I forget where it was somewhere on Facebook.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.440]   Somebody said, Hey, wherever you are, join your town's Facebook group because wow, you
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.600]   learn things about that.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.840]   That's great as people who care about the same as you care about.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.040]   No, I think it's possible.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.040]   I think it's hard.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.240]   Doesn't have to be physically.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.000]   That's one of the things I liked about the internet is that interest groups didn't have
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.160]   to be geographically proximate that you could have a chess club that's all over the world
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.080]   instead of a chess club that's in Petaluma.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.000]   But if you're trying to make the world a better place like some of Jeff's examples, it becomes
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.040]   very hard not to do that locally.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:33.720]   So that I don't think you can do a lot of things entirely online.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   I think to fulfill some basic human needs for most people getting you away from your computers
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   probably going to be better and having a meat space counterpart.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   I hate to speak.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:51.200]   So I spent a meeting this book called the Politics of Mass Society.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:59.080]   And at a higher level, by William Cornhouse, or 1959, all he got was a very used copy because
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.240]   I'm very interested right now in this notion of mass society.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.480]   And so Stacey, you're right.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.760]   I think that local is very powerful.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:11.120]   But when you're a transsexual teenager, local may be gathering a hundred people from around
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.560]   the world to feel you have enough to have a community.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.560]   So local can now gather new definitions.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:23.160]   But in either case, what Cornhouse says is that when you have a posity of independent
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:29.320]   groups, I'm quoting him, then people are more subject to manipulation and mobilization.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:35.040]   So in a pluralist, in a proper good pluralist and diverse society, he says, I'm quoting,
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:40.240]   the population is unavailable for such manipulation in that people possess multiple commitments
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:44.560]   to diverse and autonomous groups to communities.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.960]   When people are divorced from their communities and work, they feel free to reunite in new
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.200]   ways that is to be feed for trolls.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.520]   That's what really struck me in this discussion, that the more we have more connections to
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   people.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.480]   And the great thing here is that, because the problem is when you don't have a community
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.280]   you define yourself with, you're just part of an anonymous mass.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.320]   When you do define yourself with a community, you also define yourself as an individual.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:15.000]   That's the great, wonderful paradox about communities, that by joining a community, I
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   also establish my own identity as a person.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.880]   And that a community that is open to many communities and that allows and values, those
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.120]   stronger connections among those communities is going to be a more pluralist and diverse
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.120]   society.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.560]   The society where we are lumped together is vulnerable to the deleterians.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.680]   And I apologize for that faux academic moment there.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.520]   But that's what fascinated me about this whole discussion around Facebook was to rethink
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.120]   the value of these ties.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.080]   And David Weinberger would argue that weak ties do add up to something strong and I agree
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.080]   with that.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.400]   And I've agreed with that for a long time.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.560]   But that's not sufficient.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.560]   And of lecture.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.040]   So, that was very deep.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:01.160]   Is this going to be enough to say, is this going to be enough to save Facebook?
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.240]   And what do publishers do going forward?
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.120]   So there's two things going on.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:11.600]   Is this enough to say Facebook, but also publishers are freaking out because they live by the
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.320]   sword, die by this sword, live by Facebook.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.960]   Now they're afraid they're going to die by Facebook.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.720]   And as I say my piece, I fully can confess, I drove people to do more on Facebook as to
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.080]   Facebook themselves.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.120]   And people said to me all along, we're going to get the rug pull out of underneath us.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.920]   And I think I said that.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.920]   Where's the rug?
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.920]   You and others as well.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.920]   Yes.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.920]   But I noticed we didn't, you know, there was a lot of interest perhaps in going all along.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   I've seen this every time.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:42.760]   You know, we've been doing this now 12 years, more than that, 13 years.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.880]   And you know, there, there was a whole thing.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.160]   Oh, we should do more Facebook video.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.960]   Oh, we should do more YouTube video.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.960]   Why do you distribute anywhere but YouTube?
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.480]   Why don't you just put it all on YouTube?
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.080]   And I kind of held the line and I'm kind of glad I did.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.000]   You're right.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.880]   The problem, and I don't think it's malevolent on Facebook's part.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.960]   I think that they just come along and try something that doesn't work and they try the
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.480]   next thing and oops, the collateral damage is the collateral damage.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   No, I think you're right.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   I absolutely agree with you on that.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   But that is, that is a defendant.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.760]   I, as I do say in my, in my first piece, I think that Facebook, whether it wanted or
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.000]   not, became the key distributor of news and information society and it cannot abrogate
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   that responsibility.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Why not?
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   You have to figure out how to carry out that responsibility.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.160]   Your only interest at this point is, and there only interest ever has been to be a
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.160]   profitable corporation.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.520]   But then you've got Zuckerberg there saying he wants to build a better Facebook, saying
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.280]   he wants to build a better society, saying he wants to build a run community.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.440]   That's good for corporate public.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.760]   Well, that's good for a company.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.680]   Well, a company has to have some vision, I think Google still has a vision, organize
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.280]   the world's attention and make a people are happier when they connect, right?
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.680]   Yeah, his vision is just letting people in the world connect.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.040]   And I don't think there's anything to do with news with regard to that.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.720]   And I actually don't know if I want Facebook to be my arbiter of news and I.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.040]   Are you okay if Facebook just said no more news?
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.040]   Stop.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.440]   Except, was that mean even if I post a news article?
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.440]   No.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.440]   Okay.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   Yeah, then I'm fine with it.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   I don't give any more Facebook.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.440]   The New York Times has no role there.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.920]   Unless I explicitly make them my buddy.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   Wow.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.760]   Right?
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.400]   I think this is the funny thing, Jeff.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.880]   If you ask normal people, that's what they assume Facebook is.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.880]   Yes.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.880]   Yes.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.600]   They don't think it's how I file.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:40.840]   Although we also know almost half of America gets its news from Facebook solely.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.680]   So what is the social responsibility Facebook does has?
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   That's the question.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.880]   They should put a big banner that says, don't get your news here, kids.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.880]   Go to wake up.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:54.440]   Their big responsibility is probably transparency about the data they're collecting, transparency
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.280]   about how they're manipulating what they show you.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.240]   I mean, that's their ethical job.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.140]   It's not.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.140]   It's not to show us news.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.140]   I agree with you on that.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.140]   What do we ask you?
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.140]   We'll be asking you another question.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.140]   We'll be asking you another one.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.620]   Do television networks have a responsibility to help inform the public?
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   Was that is that a problem?
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.500]   Yeah, they do because they're using public airwaves.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.500]   What about cable?
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.500]   What about cable systems?
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.500]   Do they have a response?
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.500]   No, that's entertainment only.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.500]   People say, I'm going to get rid of it.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.500]   I'm going to get rid of it.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.500]   CNN and Fox.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.500]   It just causes too much trouble says Comcast.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.500]   I just screw it.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.500]   I'm going to get rid of it.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.500]   That's fine.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.500]   Would they be ever getting their public responsibility?
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.500]   No.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.500]   No.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.500]   Might be a good thing.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.500]   Actually, yeah.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.420]   I'm kind of like, hey, what would happen if that happened?
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.420]   Oh, geez.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.420]   Dark conversations that do.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.420]   I'm like, get better.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:42.900]   I think all news channels are, if you're going to point to one thing wrong with this country,
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.420]   it's the 24 hour news cycle created by these all news channels.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:52.300]   I would submit, no matter what Facebook does is diminumous.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:58.820]   What Facebook does is diminumous compared to what 24 hour news channels have done.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.620]   And I would also argue that if you eliminated those things, not that that's going to happen,
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.740]   you would also create a better environment for support for local news.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.740]   Yes.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.740]   For real news.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.740]   For your newspaper.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.740]   Oh my.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.860]   Or it could be delivered via the internet.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:13.860]   I don't care.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.300]   There'd be a market for news.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.300]   You want news?
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.860]   We have a really good system for delivering news called the internet.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.220]   TV is not a good system for delivering news.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.260]   It never, ever has been.
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.860]   Does the internet a good system for delivering news?
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.860]   Yes.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.380]   It's a great system.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:37.220]   It's a good system as long as you are able to critically read things and understand where
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.220]   they came from.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.220]   That's up to you.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.220]   You have to.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.220]   Yes.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.220]   But I'm sorry if you're not able to do that.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.220]   So then we need to educate people.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.220]   Right.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.220]   That's not.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.060]   Well, no, there's, there's an entire class of people who are not educated in this because
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.580]   they've never had to be educated in this.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.220]   And because our schools haven't trained people.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.380]   It's more than that.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.020]   And I actually this, I'm stealing this from Michael Scott in Fire and Fury.
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.660]   People don't care about politics at all.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.780]   This isn't just politics.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.420]   This is understanding things like vaccines are good.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.340]   That's seen as politics.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.820]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.820]   It's more than politics.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.900]   But that's seen, that's include that in the umbrella.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:15.100]   People don't care about the weighty issues of the day.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.180]   They care about what am I going to have for dinner?
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.460]   How am I going to be able to get sick?
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.100]   They care about that stuff.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.100]   That's fine.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.100]   And that's lovely.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:29.380]   But you still have to have a class of people who make arguments to set policies to get
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.180]   people to stuff they want to get.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.100]   That's what it's always been that way, right?
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   There's always been the only.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.100]   Yes.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.700]   I'll let the elite worry about it.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.180]   It's not even that elite.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.220]   I know, I know, but that's what they call them.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.900]   The East Coast elites and all of that.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.780]   Happy birthday, Betty White.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.580]   She was born on this day in 1922.
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.940]   She's 96 years old and I got that out of Reddit.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.140]   So there she's older than the queen.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.140]   She's older than the queen.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.140]   Her reign is.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.900]   Her reign is longer than the queen.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.380]   Queen Betty.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.380]   Queen Betty.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.500]   Big changes from Google Fi.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.540]   I'm curious what you think about this.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:16.100]   It's billed as Google Fi data is now free, but it's not exactly.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:24.420]   No one's fully unlimited or fully free, but you max out at 60 bucks, which is, well,
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.340]   60 bucks plus the 20 bucks for video.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.100]   You have to use.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.100]   So this is great.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.540]   I'm a Google Fi subscriber.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.100]   I think you are as well, right?
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.100]   Yes.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:40.500]   What this means is that we will not pay more than $80 a line, no matter how much data we
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:46.260]   use, they do say after 15 gigabytes in a month, they'll slow you down unless you want to pay.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.260]   Which is a lot.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:51.620]   Yeah, that's, this is really puts them in line with the other carriers, frankly, except
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.620]   that they're explicit.
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.900]   Whereas the other carriers say unlimited things.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.380]   Here's the other big change, Leo.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.540]   Used to be, and it was a minor point, but you used to pay in advance and they would basically
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.900]   kind of refund you.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:02.900]   Yes.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.340]   And what you didn't spend now, now they're going to other sensible ways.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.180]   You'll pay for what you use as you go.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.700]   Giga, they're done.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.700]   Nice.
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.060]   And you don't pay for anything you don't use.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:17.220]   So if you just used voice and zero zero gig, it would be $20 a month.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.140]   That's my phone for travel.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.620]   So there are months go by when all that pays for the line.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:29.700]   They call it bill protection, which is probably an accurate way to put it after bill protection
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:36.260]   kicks in at six gigabytes after that data is free for the rest of your billing cycle.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:41.500]   And after 15 gigabytes, you'll be slowed down a little bit unless, and you can apparently
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:45.260]   you can opt in to pay, continue to pay $10 a gigabyte and not be slow.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:50.260]   No, I guess what happens after 15, you could say, no, I'll pay for it now.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.260]   I don't know.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.260]   You can?
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.260]   Yeah.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.420]   There's a, yeah, if you don't want to be slowed down, use a way not to do that.
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.420]   Oh, there is.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.420]   I didn't know that.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.420]   I don't know if this makes sense.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:44:59.420]   No, that's a good deal.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.660]   That's what they've always charged.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.660]   Yeah, I know.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.980]   But that's that's ridiculous.
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.240]   I think it's a good deal.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.900]   Yeah, it is, frankly.
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.420]   I mean, this look at my plan.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.900]   I keep it debating going ahead and fully switching over to fine.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.260]   I'm on a Google phone anyway.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:21.300]   I'm stubborn about my AT&T, grandfather, unlimited account.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.300]   Just I want to stick it to him.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.300]   I keep it.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:30.940]   This will be rolling out.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:36.380]   This will be rolling out to buy customers nationwide over the next few days.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:37.380]   I got my email already.
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.380]   Did you?
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.380]   Nice.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.860]   Yeah, still Stacey, when I download a Audible book and it gets warning, warning, you could
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.260]   be using data, I think.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.260]   You know nothing.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.260]   I do not care.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.820]   I know I love those things.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:50.820]   Data.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:51.820]   I can ignore them.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:52.820]   Ten of them.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.100]   Ten eggs for a book.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.900]   Yes, I got my email too.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.940]   An important update to your project five plan introducing build protection data when you
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.940]   need it and savings when you don't.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.900]   Oh, they sound just like a carrier now.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:06.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.060]   I don't know.
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.060]   That's all right.
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.460]   That's all right, Google.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:11.460]   That's good.
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.460]   I think this is good.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:16.420]   Yeah, if you don't make money, you know.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.420]   Well, they don't do they.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.700]   I mean, is fire even a profit center for Google?
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.700]   I wonder.
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.700]   Oh, I don't think so.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.700]   I can imagine.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.740]   Why hasn't it come and cut it?
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.740]   They're reselling data.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.180]   I mean, that's why they're gigabyte costs are so high.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.380]   If Google had its druthers, I'm sure it could figure out how to drop that in a heartbeat.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:36.340]   By the way, if you have multiple members on your plan, it's different.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:41.420]   So they have a little spreadsheet for you showing for the number of people who use it
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.860]   and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.820]   This was always the like my nightmare days when carriers would change their plans because
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:50.020]   you had to like explain.
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.180]   You start here.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.660]   If you add more people, this happens.
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.420]   And if you go over, it's ridiculous.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:02.900]   I think Google Fi is still probably the simplest and you know, it is.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.260]   And I really like it.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.300]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.900]   Does it work internationally?
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.060]   Yeah, very well.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.300]   Oh, yeah, it does.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.060]   You know where it doesn't work?
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.540]   So they say we're working most countries.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.940]   I think it's 190 countries.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.940]   I found one that doesn't work in because I was there in Monaco.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:20.940]   Really?
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.020]   Yeah, but the good news is France is a mile away.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:28.260]   So take a walk, use the phone and then come back to Monaco.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.700]   Monaco actually is less than a mile away.
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.820]   There's nowhere you can go in Monaco that France is more than I think a kilometer away.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.780]   All right.
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.940]   So it's okay.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:43.180]   I guess they decided not to do the deal with Monaco Telecom or whatever.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.740]   Maybe they had.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:52.660]   If you have a Google Cast device, actually, I had them all over the house, right?
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:59.460]   Google Home, Google Chromecast, audio, Google Audiocast.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:05.220]   This was first discovered by a Chinese, very popular Chinese router manufacturer called
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.580]   TP Link.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.940]   But now others are saying, yeah, it happens to us too.
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.540]   It will, it couldn't actually cause your Wi-Fi to drop out periodically.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.180]   And this was happening to me.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:23.420]   So what happens is these devices, these Google devices, Google says they're fixing this tomorrow.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:29.220]   These Google devices, when they wake up from sleep, they have a stay awake thing.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:34.020]   They start, they dump data on the network or something and it overloads the Wi-Fi router
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:38.060]   and it goes and it dies for a while and then it comes back.
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.900]   So I thought, well, I wonder if this was happening to me.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.420]   So I disconnected everything.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.300]   I have many, many Google Assistant, Google Home.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.780]   It's supposed to take about an hour to find them.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.260]   Unplug them all.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.780]   The Chromecast are hard to find because they're little and they're stuck behind things.
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:56.500]   I think, I know I got them all because I then used a Wi-Fi manager to look and see if I
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.500]   could see any signals.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.500]   Couldn't.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:03.300]   The only thing I sat about is I had unplug my Nvidia Shield TV because it has a built-in
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.300]   Chromecast.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:09.540]   Lo and behold, my data hasn't dropped in 48 hours.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.540]   So they're going to fix this.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.540]   Do they have to?
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.540]   They're fixing it tomorrow.
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.540]   I hope they fix it.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:17.580]   Through every one of those devices or through the watch all their devices.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.220]   They patch all their devices.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:23.780]   I think they're using UDP, which is one of the issues.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.900]   It has no congestion protection.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.900]   Yeah, so not a TCP fan.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:34.220]   Well, you usually want UDP for streaming because UDP is more efficient on streaming
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.380]   because there's no ACK.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.780]   But the lack of congestion protection is, I think, what's going on here.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.260]   Anyway, I don't know what they'll do to fix it.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:46.740]   The first part, according to VentureBeat, the first part of the fix is a patch to Google
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:51.540]   Play services that run on Android phones.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.500]   And then it says it's unclear if an update for home devices and other cast-enabled hardware
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.740]   will be necessary.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:00.460]   Maybe the app, the Google Home app that you're running on your phone.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.460]   I don't know.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.460]   Control-to-do.
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.300]   It talks to the device and tells it to go to sleep.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:10.100]   This is your beat because this is a Stacy because this is an I/O.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.100]   It's Stacy.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.220]   But this is an I/O.T. device causing havoc in the home.
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.660]   We talked about it on the show.
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.820]   We explained what was happening.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:20.340]   We didn't have the data this morning when we recorded about when the patch was coming
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.340]   up.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.340]   But we did talk about why it was happening.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.780]   Yeah, in fact, I didn't know about this either.
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.020]   So that's good news.
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.420]   I hope it works.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:33.580]   I'm not going to plug my Google Homes in for a while.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:38.300]   I didn't have this problem with my Google Homes, but maybe it's also a function of the
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.300]   type of routers.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.260]   But you're using the Eros.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.260]   Are you using the Eros?
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:43.260]   Eros and plumes.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.380]   Both were, in fact, plume more so than anybody.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.700]   But the interesting thing is, some have said it also happens with Google Wi-Fi.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.580]   They're all router.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:58.300]   Yeah, Kevin said he didn't have an issue with the Google Wi-Fi.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:03.740]   It's one of those issues you might not notice because it's a brief dropout.
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:08.420]   Here's where you'll notice if you're streaming video, the video will stop.
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.900]   And then it'll pause.
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:10.900]   It won't rebuffer.
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.300]   It'll pause because it's not getting anything.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:13.860]   And then it'll come back.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:18.220]   Yeah, I mean, who knows?
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:21.060]   Let's see if you notice me go out during the middle of the show because then you'll
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.060]   be there.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.060]   Yeah, well, that's a good point.
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.060]   That's never happened.
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:27.740]   Although we do have people we talk to who do that does periodically happen.
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.900]   They just stop and then come back.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:30.900]   Huh?
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:31.900]   A certain situation.
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.900]   I'll go on the chat.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.380]   That was a good point here.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.380]   What's that?
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.780]   When you plug them all back in, they're all going to get patches.
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.380]   There's going to be a flood of day.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.820]   Yeah, plug them in at night.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.780]   Later night, like the middle of the night in certain situations to bug.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:50.140]   This is Google, a bug in the cast software on Android phones.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:55.060]   So they're saying it's the phones may incorrectly send a large amount of network traffic, which
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.220]   can slow down or temporarily impact Wi-Fi networks.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:01.580]   The specific impact the network will vary depending on the router.
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:07.100]   People with an Android phone and a Chromecast built in device, such as a Chromecast or Google
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:11.340]   home device on the same Wi-Fi network may experience this issue.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:12.340]   I feel bad.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.380]   I'm the only one in the family with an Android phone.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.380]   So you don't need to mess it up your network.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.140]   You know what I'm going to do?
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.940]   I'm going to turn off my phone.
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:26.220]   I have a note eight running all the time in a Net Pixel 2 XL.
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:31.500]   Maybe if I turn off your phone, your Facebook, your Twitter, your TV, and you're going to
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:32.500]   be just so happy.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.500]   So you see the new thing?
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.940]   It was an article in the New York Times.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:43.500]   If you really want to get over your phone addiction, make your phone black and white.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.660]   And you know what?
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.660]   It's true.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.700]   It's horrible.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.180]   It's a nightmare.
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.500]   So it's in display on the iPhone.
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:55.620]   It's a little hard to do on an Android in the iPhone.
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.900]   It's in display accommodations.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.820]   This is these are the bright and brilliant colors you would get normally on an iPhone.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:06.860]   If you turn on color filters, you can choose grayscale and then, oh my God.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.620]   It's a communist iPhone.
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.620]   It's a Stalinist iPhone.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:12.100]   It must be when they have a North Korea.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.780]   And I have to say it's true.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:20.860]   It really when you look at your photos ugly, when you look at Instagram or Facebook ugly,
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.960]   so depressing.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.100]   You can do it on an Android phone.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:30.580]   If you go to developer options, you have to tweak around with the developer options.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:36.540]   But what do you do realize is when you turn the black and white off, how compelling these
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.540]   are.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.660]   I said, it's pretty, pretty.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.140]   It's a glowing screen.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.540]   You could just put it in front of a baby and watch.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:44.540]   Yes.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:46.940]   I mean, it's like mobile.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.940]   They're like, whoa.
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.540]   And they're like, whoa.
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.420]   Did you have a mobile for your daughter when she was little?
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.420]   I think so.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:00.300]   I had whatever the baby's RS catalog told you to go get.
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.300]   I went.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.380]   All the rage when Abby and Henry were little.
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:04.500]   I don't think it helped.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.100]   Was black and white mobiles.
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.100]   Oh, yes.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:08.100]   That's right.
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.100]   I forgot.
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.100]   That's right.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:11.100]   Exactly.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:12.100]   Same.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.100]   We don't see them anymore.
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:14.660]   By contrast, because they weren't in the color.
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:15.660]   That's true.
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.700]   Babies can't see color at first, I think.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.700]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.700]   I don't know.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:23.780]   So a baby would like the Stalinist iPhone.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.780]   No, the baby.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.540]   Just likes the iPhone.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.540]   Babies love that.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:29.540]   Is that true?
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.540]   They like gravitate?
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:35.820]   If you stick a phone in front of a baby, they'll just, most of them after like six months,
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.940]   they know how to turn it on.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.940]   Wow.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:38.940]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:42.020]   You know what's terrible is candy, crush and black and white.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.180]   Because you can't.
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.180]   It's horrible.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.940]   You can't play it.
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:47.940]   Why?
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:51.260]   See, I think this is to make it so you don't waste time on your phone.
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:52.260]   It is.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.060]   Your phone still functions in every way.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:55.620]   You just don't enjoy it.
[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.100]   Just don't enjoy it.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:00.300]   I'm like, it's like fat free ice cream.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.260]   Halo top.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:09.820]   Google has created Google had so much is having so much trouble filling IT jobs that
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:15.580]   they've created a free certificate program on Coursera.
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:22.100]   So if you don't have any IT experience, but you want to get an entry level support job,
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.500]   it might take you eight to 12 months.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:28.220]   You can take a free course on Coursera, the big MOOC.
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.420]   The big MOOC.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:34.260]   And you can get an IT job.
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:39.100]   Natalie Van Cleef, Conley, former head of Google's tech support program, was having
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.260]   trouble finding IT support specialists.
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:44.260]   So she spearheaded this certificate program.
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:51.900]   It's also part of Google doing its bit to help Americans get skills in a changing economy.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.340]   So are these full time jobs?
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.340]   Are they going to be?
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.140]   Well, you doesn't carry to you a job.
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.300]   It's just you get the skills.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.300]   I guess you get a certificate.
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:06.340]   They do point out though, they don't require college degree.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.100]   But the problem getting job is you need experience.
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.580]   So this will substitute in some cases for experience.
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:17.260]   The median annual wage for a computer network supports specialist $62,670.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:19.740]   Computer user supports specialist $52,160.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:23.540]   So they're good jobs.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:26.340]   So do you think we'll ever get to the point where we would train too many people in computer
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.340]   science?
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:32.100]   No, because that's like saying you've trained too many people to read.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:36.620]   Eventually, you're going to have to know all of this stuff just a function in the world.
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:40.180]   Or you're going to have to have an understanding of this stuff to function in the world.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.380]   It certainly wouldn't hurt.
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:45.380]   Have there been gluts before in professions?
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.380]   Well, yeah.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:49.620]   Lawyers, MBAs.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:50.620]   Journalists.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.900]   There are too many journalists now.
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.940]   Sorry, Jeff.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.380]   Are still good jobs.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.580]   Are still good jobs.
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.340]   Yeah, there have been.
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:05.820]   Yeah, think about all the seamstresses out there.
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:08.540]   And what are they doing?
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:09.540]   Buggy Whitminton.
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:17.420]   This is why we commissioned a study at my center at CUNY in the job skills needed in the field
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:19.580]   so that we can be training people for the right skills.
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:23.740]   There's whole new job titles in journalism, like product development.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.740]   Never existed.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.740]   Right.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:27.740]   Audience development never existed.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:31.020]   Commerce is now a growing skill.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:35.460]   So these are new things that we need to train people for.
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:36.620]   Well, wait, commerce?
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:39.940]   As a revenue sales people.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.860]   Well, no, it's not actually the monetization.
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:44.340]   And it's a monetization.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:48.780]   Well, it's a form of native content is what it is.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:57.500]   I know, I know, I know, but wire cutter.
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:58.660]   That's a good example.
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:00.060]   They monetize in a night.
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.060]   They do affiliates, don't they?
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.060]   Do they do something fancy?
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.500]   Yeah, they do, but that's the that's the commerce.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.740]   That's how you make the money.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.380]   So is there like a.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:12.980]   Is there a business that needs to happen or a relationship that happens with affiliate
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.540]   links or do you just?
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.060]   I don't know how this works.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:19.740]   Well, both Stacy, I've been learning this because we have the best people we have in
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.100]   to the room to figure this out.
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.700]   And fascinating, a few interesting things about this.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.980]   Well, you got me started.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.100]   Is that it is another revenue stream.
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:34.940]   And the people who are doing this, like New York magazine, Gizmodo Media, Perch, there's
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:38.860]   a bunch of companies that are doing this and doing this well, they actually find it
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.500]   kind of freeing because they have to maintain the trust of the audience.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:46.100]   If because Moto tells you this is the best deal and it's not, you're going to say screw
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:47.260]   you the next time.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.260]   So trust matters.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:53.380]   They also find themselves freed from having to go after every damned advertising RFP.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:56.740]   But you do have to create content that becomes a home for this.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.500]   One of the best selling things on business insider.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:03.340]   I love this at least in the beginning when they started this was wallets, place for your
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.340]   money.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:08.100]   And what they would do is do, you know, 10 best wallets.
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:09.100]   What's the best wallet?
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.860]   Look at wallets and they put links on there to sell the wallets.
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.340]   And I bought a whole bunch of wall.
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.260]   And then after that, you would, because you're a susceptible man.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.340]   I was suckered in by that.
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:21.780]   And then when they find ones really selling, Leo's bought 10 of them, then they call them
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.460]   manufacturer and say, let's, let's do a deal directly and not do this through Amazon.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.460]   And we'll do it.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.460]   It's funny.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:28.460]   You don't see wallet ads anymore.
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.460]   All the time.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:35.260]   It's like, it's like the, that, that suitcase has advertised all the time on TV now.
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:38.100]   Um, oh, you know, you've seen it.
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.100]   No, I don't.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.100]   I don't.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.100]   I don't have a TV away back.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.100]   The way back.
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.740]   Oh, yeah, there used to be a sponsor here.
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:47.900]   And then they decided, Oh, this is what happened by the way, every one of our sponsors
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.740]   get great success here.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:54.140]   And then they say, now we can advertise in real media.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.140]   Volume.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.140]   Volume.
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:59.620]   But I think we do a better job for them.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:00.620]   You do.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.860]   And we're more efficient for them.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.820]   But everybody wants to be big time.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.820]   It's funny.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.700]   Cause I always used to complain about that among new media people's like, they're all
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.380]   trying to get on TV.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.700]   Like you made it.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.180]   If you could take that podcast and get on TV.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.180]   That's true.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.620]   That's on TV now.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.340]   And that's true for advertisers.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:19.340]   It turns out who knew.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:24.700]   Let's say, see the other lesson from this is that you'd like to get away from Amazon
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.940]   because there's a cap on what the affiliate fees are and so on and so forth.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.900]   But the consumers love buying through Amazon.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:39.860]   So just as we were stuck with Google for advertising and with Facebook for audience, we're going
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.700]   to be stuck with Amazon for commerce.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.700]   Okay.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.380]   But there's a revenue stream there.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:50.420]   So why don't you wait since this is business?
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.420]   Why don't.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.660]   Way back when there was a trio blog.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:55.860]   Remember the old trio?
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.340]   My favorite phone in the old days?
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:58.340]   Yes.
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.220]   There was a guy who did a trio blog and he started to say, well, here are all sold cases
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.220]   and stuff.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:07.420]   He became a major business for a good amount of time where he sold both trios and accessories.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:13.380]   So Stacy, for you, is there a business in actually becoming an affiliate e-commerce recommended
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.540]   site for a wire cutter for IoT?
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:23.420]   So there is, but I'm lazy.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.420]   Okay.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.420]   So here's the child.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:32.500]   Very in a nutshell, my business runs on 90% of my audience are not that interested in
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:37.700]   my ads, but the 10% of my audience that are highly valuable to my advertisers.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.820]   So that works out really well for me.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:47.780]   So that's where I'm trying to stay and affiliate ads takes up a lot of it.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.260]   It takes time to get going.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:55.980]   And what if you did a separate sub brand that was Stacy's IoT picks?
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:58.820]   Because I just buy them just like wire cutter.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:01:59.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.100]   But I trust you on IoT.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.380]   I know you've tested the hell out of them.
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:05.260]   I know you're, I know what your husband's complained about.
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.740]   I know, right?
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:12.580]   So I would, if I wanted to buy IoT stuff, I would come straight to you, buy it through
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.580]   you.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.540]   Yeah, there's a conflict of interest, but you're going to be very clear about that.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:20.340]   You're going to maintain your trust in your brand and I trust you for that.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.180]   I'm telling you, there is an opportunity for you.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.500]   No, there is an opportunity.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.540]   It just means that I have to write right now.
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:28.420]   We don't do a lot of written reviews.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:32.180]   So and I think it's a huge ethical considerations.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.900]   It was out of affiliate links.
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.660]   Well, you'll promote this.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.660]   You'll tell people.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.660]   You'll tell people.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.660]   Right.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.140]   You'll, and I instead of doing esoteric things, you know, that nobody really cares about.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.100]   Because you're going to make more money on something that a hundred people will buy than
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.100]   something five people will buy.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.100]   But.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:56.060]   So there's pressures, but you know, all advertising has, it's always potentially some pressures.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:59.140]   You just have to resist them and say, no, I'm going to continue to do the editorial that
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:00.660]   I do.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.940]   And you do have to disclose, don't you?
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.580]   I mean, they're, they're, they're been covered.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:07.020]   Pinterest gotten a lot of trouble when people realized that they were putting associate
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:08.660]   links on Pinterest links.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:13.340]   Of course, it was other people's telling us, they see I'm telling you, no, I want to
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.340]   put it.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.140]   I actually think it's a really nice kind of monetization.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:20.020]   We've done a little bit of this too, because it doesn't.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.100]   You Leo for God's sake.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.100]   What am I doing?
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.100]   Well, get right.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.100]   You should be selling.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.860]   So we did a couple of things.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:30.020]   One, we, we suggested that people use our link when they buy stuff on Amazon.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:34.460]   We just said, Hey, if you just go start doing Amazon shopping through this link, then we'll
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.980]   get a percentage of everything you buy.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.180]   It's a painless way for you to donate.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.540]   No matter what they buy.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.540]   Right.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:41.540]   And I don't know if we still do that.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:48.380]   And then I think for, I can't remember, but I think sometimes I have personally on my blog,
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:49.780]   I don't know if we twits done it.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.740]   We've had affiliate links.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.340]   I don't, well, maybe not on products that we, you know, in an article about a product.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:59.780]   The problem is most of our content is, is audio and video, which has no links at all.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.580]   Well, but again, I'll say to say, maybe you, I just said, Stacy, if there were a Twitch
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.020]   shop brand, we're not selling t-shirts.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.020]   That's fine.
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.020]   That's, that's, that's the minimalist.
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.020]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:14.780]   But that, you know, I see what you and Padre and so on and so forth.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:15.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:16.780]   I thought about that.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:18.780]   We'd sell like Leo's computer.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.820]   I put, you know, Kim Commando does this.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:26.220]   I put together the best computer with everything I like and you can buy.
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.220]   Nothing I don't.
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.700]   Kevin and I have talked about it.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:35.660]   I feel like that's a little skeezy or at least appears to be, it's not skeezy, but it appears
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.660]   to be skeezy.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.620]   Because you want to excuse me.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:39.620]   Because gizmo.
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:48.580]   Like, for example, they show you all the like 300,000 people have clicked on this link,
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:53.660]   which I actually think is really cool when they have their affiliate links.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:57.260]   But I'm also worried that like, if I did it, there'd be like four people have clicked
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.060]   on this link and I'd be like, whoa.
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:02.820]   And my audience would be like, why are we here?
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:09.780]   But I could sell Stacy's house or Kevin's house, but everything's so use case specific, it
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.220]   doesn't seem like a good idea.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.220]   I like our model.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.220]   I like your model.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:19.500]   I like clearly identified interstitial ads that people know this is an ad.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:24.220]   You know, there's some hand curation, you know, of the content and the people and, you
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.020]   know, so that we don't advertise stuff that you junk.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:32.780]   I mean, really, there is that impression when you, you know, that when you, you, if Stacy's
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:36.780]   advertising and early on advertising is stuff they approve of, they like, and it better
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.220]   be because I tell you what people blame me if they, if they, if they get by a product
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.580]   we advertise and they don't like it, they don't blame the company.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.580]   They blame me.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.860]   It's like a friend said, hey, you really ought to try this barber and you got a terrible
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.860]   haircut.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.660]   Who are you going to blame the barber or the friend?
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:55.020]   Well, you got a boy, you do buy everything.
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.100]   I found the best sprinkly eyelashes to leave.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.100]   I bought those.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.100]   I can't wait.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:05.060]   I got the indie go go email that my led eyelashes that you told me to get.
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.340]   I'm very excited to see them on you.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.980]   And when you were tired of them, I will take them.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.940]   You, you don't want used eyelashes.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.940]   Yeah, I don't.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.940]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.940]   Okay.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.340]   You could just send them to me and I'll try them.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.340]   I might.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.340]   I know.
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:22.620]   And I'll wear my lavender wig and then you can be like rave with Stacy.
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:23.620]   Wow.
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.660]   You're going to have glow sticks and stuff.
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:27.660]   I could.
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.540]   I want my toots the unicorn.
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.580]   Where's my toots the unicorn?
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.180]   What was toots the unicorn?
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.180]   I can't remember.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.980]   I can't remember all the things you bought.
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:37.380]   I am such a sucker.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:38.380]   Oh my God.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.540]   I hate myself.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:44.820]   I am such a sucker for like kick, you know, crowdsourced stuff.
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.540]   This guy's this guy raised $8,299.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.220]   Oh, now his video is even gone.
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.580]   Oh, I don't think I'm going to get my toots.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:55.580]   He took his video off YouTube.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.580]   Oh, why?
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:01.260]   So the idea was it was a unicorn that farted in rainbows.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.260]   And what?
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.260]   What was Leo?
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.060]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.060]   Let me actually.
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.060]   You have too much money.
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.300]   That's what this says.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.300]   No, you know what happened?
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:14.380]   The guy came to the studio and I went, oh, that's really great.
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.740]   He even brought a toots.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.300]   I said, Oh, Jamie, that's so great.
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.300]   He's from Austin.
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.620]   You ought to go knock on his door.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:22.620]   What did I get?
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.620]   Those toots.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.620]   Where's my toots?
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.060]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:32.580]   I feel like when you when you buy these things, you know what you're getting unless you bought
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.340]   it in the first six months of indigo kick.
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:40.420]   I confess that there is a little bit of comedy in it.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:44.580]   I admit that I do this.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:45.580]   I do this.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.300]   I do it for the clicks.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.300]   Let's see.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.300]   There's so I've received some of these things.
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:59.100]   The fuse card I got, but it only works with swipe machines, even though the picture shows
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.900]   a chip.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.860]   So I didn't set that up.
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:05.660]   I'm waiting for this scooter that was supposed to come six months ago waiting for toots.
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.540]   I don't know how long ago I ordered toots.
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:13.140]   You remember Gebo came by the way, D.O.A. the only time it ever worked was when I showed
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:16.820]   it to you and it wouldn't stop talking.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.820]   And then now it's.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:19.500]   Does it go and you say it burbles?
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.260]   Yeah, it's snores.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:24.260]   It's really burbling.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.580]   When you're not using it, it makes little sounds.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:27.580]   So so annoying.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:32.100]   And so I wasn't really unhappy when it died.
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.580]   That's really fast.
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:34.860]   Yeah, no, it died in a day.
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.940]   Can you get your money back from an indigo go?
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.260]   I can't remember.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:41.020]   I mean, like, is there a guarantee?
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.020]   I don't think so.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:45.900]   I'll send a no to Cynthia saying hey, Cynthia, not see what I'm afraid of is she'll send
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.860]   me when it works.
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:50.820]   Check it out.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.100]   Oh, I guess Siri decided to get involved.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.460]   No, no, no, I was like, what's happening here?
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:56.820]   Siri says, is there a guarantee?
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.180]   I don't know why she heard me.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.620]   Anyway, enough of this.
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:01.620]   This is dumb.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:07.140]   Google is giving away machine learning.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.980]   You don't even have to know anything about it.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:11.740]   So this is why I wonder how many programmers we need.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:18.380]   Yeah, this is Google wants businesses to use its AI to see photos better.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:21.700]   It's a new service they unveiled today for businesses to build apps that can automatically
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:25.420]   recognize images, the new cloud auto ML.
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.260]   So this is basically to sell their cloud, isn't it?
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:32.260]   Is to add more value added to their cloud versus Amazon's?
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.020]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:38.660]   Except they're giving it away.
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.540]   Is it they're asking you to put pictures in?
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.700]   Oh, it's a profit deal.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.500]   Well, companies, companies, pictures.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:51.180]   No, it could just be a training deal just to get there and get what they need.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.180]   That's what I call profit.
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.180]   Sorry, I don't like that.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:55.540]   For Google, that's profit.
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:58.740]   Google, to their credit, has a long-term view of profit.
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.740]   They do.
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:02.700]   Cloud, let me see if we can find out more about the...
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.580]   I remember seeing that it doesn't require programming.
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:10.540]   I have a Google Cloud cloud.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:15.100]   I have.google.com/automl, a-u-t-l.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.060]   A suite of machine learning products that enables developers with limited...
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.100]   Oh, you still need to be a programmer, but you don't have to have any experience.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:26.620]   You could be a bad programmer.
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:29.900]   And then you easily train custom vision models.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.500]   That's a good question, Stacey.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.500]   Where does it work?
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.500]   Yeah, state-of-the-art performance.
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:35.500]   Get up running.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.500]   I wonder...
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:41.020]   This is solving a really big problem, but it also raises a really interesting question
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.980]   about machine learning platforms.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.700]   So there's always this idea.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.340]   There's this holy grail.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:50.700]   Facebook built one internally of creating a more generic machine learning platform that
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.500]   anyone can use, right?
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:57.180]   Because right now you have to be very well trained to understand, like, "Oh, it's spitting
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.740]   this back with this probability.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.940]   That means I need to tweak this particular...
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.940]   Let's say...
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:02.940]   Let's say...
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:07.940]   I came up with an idea for an app that tells you whether something's a hot dog or not a
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:12.380]   hot dog.
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.180]   Not no machine language programmer.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:15.980]   In fact, well, see, and this is...
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.300]   Part of this is because people have domains, right?
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:22.380]   So I may be a great UI programmer or app programmer, but I don't think about machine language
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:23.660]   training.
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:27.500]   I would then use this to help me develop the model.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:32.900]   Yes, because you're going to have to upload and label your images according to this.
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.900]   And it does all the training.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.500]   It does in photographic samples in class.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.180]   Yes, so it's doing the hard thing, which is training the neural net.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.900]   That's actually what you have data scientists do.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.460]   This is a data scientist in the cloud.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.340]   Can we expect more hot dog or not apps?
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.340]   Because of this.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:54.060]   So this is basically like using Google's cloud to do natural language processing.
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.540]   Now this is just natural image processing.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.540]   So here's the example that you...
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:11:59.940]   Here you have to label it.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:00.940]   Yes.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:01.940]   So you're going to...
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:03.940]   You have to label it what you're...
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:08.660]   No, so the hard job is actually when you're trying to build an algorithm.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.140]   Oh, I see, right.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.340]   Knowing how much to wait, how to wait certain characteristics.
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:19.900]   So like when I look at a human's face, is it eyes that matter to determine that someone's
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:24.180]   a human or is it like the distance between eyes and the mouth?
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.100]   So like you have to...
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.580]   That's the hard part is tweaking those algorithms.
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.580]   And that's done by people.
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.580]   Does that make sense?
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.220]   You have to kind of know a lot about how this works.
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:42.500]   So but that's the point is that a lot of companies have expertise in various domains.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.020]   And their programmers may be quite expert, but they wouldn't know how to do this.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.020]   They're not statisticians.
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.020]   Yeah, statisticians.
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:50.100]   So yes, it's basically free.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:54.140]   But I see there's right next to the try a free button, a contact sales button.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:59.100]   So I'm guessing it's free-ish or freemium.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:03.460]   And yeah, a lot of companies have like really cool data.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.780]   Like imagine actually a good IOT example.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:09.260]   Imagine your house, right?
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:13.100]   So I've got, I've trained my, was it my canary?
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:16.100]   I trained it on recognizing the people in my house, right?
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:23.620]   Now they can, canary can take that, run that through Google's ML to give better image recognition,
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:27.740]   like true biometric quality image recognition, for example.
[01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:30.060]   That would be an interesting use case.
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:34.980]   Another could be, you know, photos of machines or failures in a plant.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.620]   If you offer those failures up, you don't actually have to know how to figure out how
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.620]   to make a model.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.620]   You just say, this failure is because of bad soldering.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.780]   This failure is because of, I don't know.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.380]   You know what this won't work for?
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.540]   Gorilla's chimpanzees and apes.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:54.820]   Yeah, that's still, I can't believe they haven't gotten back to that.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:57.700]   So they have, but they've cut it off because they just.
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:58.820]   They didn't in a weird way.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:05.980]   So a few years ago, a Google employee pointed out that when you search for, do an image search,
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:11.340]   or no, I'm sorry, the Google, Google photos have labeled his photos with a black friend
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:13.820]   as Gorillas.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:17.940]   Google said we're appalled, we're genuinely sorry.
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:28.180]   And the fix was not to fix the recognition, but to eliminate the word gorilla ape, chimp,
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:32.900]   chimpanzee and monkey from Google lens searches.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:37.940]   Wired tested Google photos using a collection of 40,000 images well stocked with animals
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:42.060]   that performed impressively at finding many creatures, including pandas and poodles.
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:46.300]   But according to Wired, no results for gorilla, chimp chimpanzee or something.
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.300]   This is not a technical matter.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:50.580]   This is somebody in PR who said never let this happen again.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.900]   This is embarrassing.
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:52.900]   This is bad.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.900]   It's not a good fix.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.380]   It is happening again.
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:56.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:02.220]   I wish I had some, I do have one picture of a gorilla in my, actually in my photos, but
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.340]   I can't find it.
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.180]   I do have a picture of an actual gorilla.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.260]   Well, you wouldn't be able to find it.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.340]   I know it says no results.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:15.980]   The president would be very disappointed not being able to find the gorilla channel.
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.780]   That was a ruse, but I love it.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:18.780]   That was hilarious.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.780]   It was a great room.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.780]   It was a very well done.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.780]   Was it the onion?
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:22.780]   I forget who.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:23.780]   No, no, no.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:28.300]   It was just some guy who had to change his name on his Twitter account to the gorilla
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:31.860]   thing is a, is a joke.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.140]   He tweeted an excerpt.
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:34.140]   That's what it was.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:37.620]   He tweeted an excerpt from a fire and fury that was fake.
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:43.820]   Oh, that said that Donald Trump kept looking for a channel featuring gorillas.
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.460]   Like he had it home.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:52.580]   And, and, and AIDS were so, so here's the, here's the excerpt on his first night in the White
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:53.580]   House.
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:57.060]   President Trump complained the TV in his bedroom was broken because it didn't have the gorilla
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:58.060]   channel.
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.460]   Trump seemed to be the under the impression that a TV channel existed that screened nothing
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:06.940]   but gorilla based content 24 hours a day to appease Trump White House staff compiled a
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.460]   number of gorilla documentaries into a makeshift gorilla channel.
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.260]   I was okay to this point, right?
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:15.300]   Up to this point, the next thing is what made you say, okay.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.300]   Broadcast.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:20.700]   This is the part where it's a April Fool's broadcast into Trump's bedroom from a hastily
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:23.940]   constructed transmission tower on a soft lawn.
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:27.100]   I think there are better ways to do that in the White House.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.100]   Yeah.
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.060]   However, the president was unhappy with the channel they had created moaning.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:34.900]   It was boring because the gorillas are fighting.
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.180]   So, so anyway, it's like, it's a ruse.
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:40.300]   It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a beautiful, not rude.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.300]   And he got people.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.300]   It did.
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.300]   And it gets worse, by the way.
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.300]   I don't read on it.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.300]   Just, you can Google it.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:51.420]   So, by the way, Stacy, I, you see on Twitter an account called bleak, put your photos into
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:56.100]   the Google arts and culture anyway.
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.900]   So if you, if you look for gigastacy, you'll find.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.100]   What's this?
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:06.820]   A search Twitter, Twitter, Stacy and you Leo are tagged.
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.420]   Look at your, look at your mentions on Twitter.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:09.420]   You'll find it.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.420]   Okay.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:13.820]   Oh, somebody, somebody, somebody put Stacy's photos in.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:17.420]   Oh, somebody did that as a, as a service.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.420]   Yes.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.420]   Exactly.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:20.420]   I get it.
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.860]   Photos as a service.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:22.860]   Here we go, Stacy.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:26.740]   Oh, these actually do look kind of like you.
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:27.900]   That's not too bad.
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.740]   That's not too bad.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.700]   And the current blonde.
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.300]   Actually, I think that's better.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:40.300]   Dancer, Lea, Nia, Nia, Koko from the Museo National de Teatro et Adenza.
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.300]   Dansa.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.500]   What do you think, Stace?
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500]   You're muted, Stacy.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:51.220]   Oh, we missed all of your reactions because you muted your microphone or did we do it?
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.220]   Okay.
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.900]   No, I muted because I was eating a cookie.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.620]   Oh, did you spit the cookie come out through your nose when you saw this?
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.660]   No, it did not.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:01.660]   It was not so such a great, it was not, not as awesome.
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.500]   However, you weren't that one.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.900]   I'm like, this is okay.
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:05.900]   This is accurate.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.580]   Although you're much more attractive than that.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.500]   I'm like, it's not the most flattering.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:13.340]   Yeah, it's not the most flattering, but it, but it is actually accurate.
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:14.740]   It's 59% accurate.
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:17.100]   I do have a long nose.
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.940]   This chick is probably a cuter than I am.
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.580]   So I'll take it.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:27.940]   This problem with this is I think it does make people like notice something, you know,
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:31.340]   like, like made me feel old, made you feel like you had a long nose and you don't have
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.340]   a long nose.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.340]   I do have a long nose.
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:34.340]   I'm okay with it.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.300]   No, you know what?
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.300]   Okay.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.300]   This is okay.
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.300]   This is what teenagers do.
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.300]   Teenagers, folks.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:46.620]   If you look at your nose, if you just start looking at your nose, everybody's nose is
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:47.620]   terrible.
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.060]   Nose is are terrible.
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:51.460]   I'm okay with my nose.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:54.460]   But you shouldn't look at it out of context and every teenager does this.
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:56.300]   It says, I want a nose job.
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.300]   Oh, I've got a.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.300]   All noses are hideous.
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.300]   They're hideous.
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.180]   They have my DNA.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.140]   They do not want to have the Jarvis nose.
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:05.860]   No, noses are bad.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:08.220]   There's no good noses.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.220]   Look bad.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:10.540]   You got to tell every teenager this.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.540]   This is important.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.540]   We don't want nose shaming.
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.180]   I wasn't shaming my nose.
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.180]   Although my first day.
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:17.180]   Yes, you were.
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.180]   You've internalized this.
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:19.180]   I've internalized this.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:23.220]   When I came back from college for my first trip home, my mom looked at me and she goes,
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:26.220]   Oh, I'm so glad you finally grew into your nose.
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.220]   And I was like, Oh my God.
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.220]   I had a big nose.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:30.220]   I had no idea.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.220]   She's like, No, it's perfect.
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:38.380]   Oh, oh, trust or hurt for not saying that to me right away.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.220]   Have you seen Lady Bird?
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.700]   No, no, not yet.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.700]   Can't wait.
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:43.700]   Oh, you got to go see Lady Bird.
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:46.820]   The clips I've seen ring so true.
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:48.660]   They are for the mother daughter thing.
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:49.660]   We're like the daughter of the young.
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:53.060]   That's why I think this looks good on you.
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:54.060]   Oh, really?
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.060]   You think this is good?
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.060]   I mean, it's hysterical.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.060]   I can't wait to see it.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.260]   I do want to see it.
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.900]   So I found somebody who has a nice nose, Amman Ra and our chat room says, I have no problems
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.900]   with my nose.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:08.340]   I actually get compliments on it.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.180]   I think you're in denial, Amman Ra.
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:12.180]   Look a little closer.
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.420]   Wait, I don't have a problem with my nose.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:17.700]   No, you're not just fabulous.
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:21.900]   I actually had a girlfriend who really actually had a hideous nose.
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.420]   Well, I'm really.
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.180]   It does have.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.140]   It was like a shark's fin.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.860]   It was a thin and it was a blade.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:36.900]   It was like scary looking and it had a big hook in it.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.980]   But it was just it's a nose all look it.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   It's a proboscis.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.980]   Like you've seen the gorillas with the ugly proboscis is that's all it is.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.580]   Isn't it isn't a proboscis?
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:46.140]   I'm sorry, proboscis.
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.020]   Proboscis is something else.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:50.020]   Yes, it's a proboscis.
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.020]   Thank you for correcting me.
[01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.020]   My whole life.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.020]   I've been saying proboscis.
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.140]   No, no, you're right.
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.820]   It's proboscis.
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:00.460]   And there is a proboscis butterfly.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:02.620]   You want to see the dog?
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.420]   No, that's a different kind of proboscis.
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.380]   How about the proboscis gorilla?
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:09.340]   Will Gil will Google give me the.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.580]   You'll go up by that.
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:16.300]   No, this is what everybody thinks their nose looks like.
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.660]   Everybody thinks their nose looks like that.
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:20.660]   And they're not far wrong.
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.940]   The president's hair looks like that.
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:23.940]   Stop it.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:24.940]   Sorry.
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:25.940]   Stop it.
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:26.940]   Just completely wrong.
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.740]   No ad hominem comments.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:36.740]   Google, according to Corey Doctorow and people who have tested it, has started to ignore old
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:37.740]   pages.
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:42.500]   Tim Bray, who's a great pioneer of XML and early blogger and I've followed him since
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:50.860]   the beginning, was searching for posts he had posted in 2006 and 2008.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:56.260]   He knew exactly what the articles were and he couldn't find them.
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.260]   He is disturbing.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:59.460]   Yeah, direct quotes.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:01.980]   But it makes sense, right?
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:06.900]   This is Tim's, I should actually refer to instead of Corey's article on Boing Boing.
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.420]   Tim's actual article.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:13.340]   Back in 2006, I published a review of Lou Reed's rock and roll animal album.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:20.700]   Brent Simmons in 2008 published a review of the Clash's London Calling.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.700]   He said, "Here's a challenge.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.500]   Can you find either of these with Google?"
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:26.180]   2006 and 2008 is not that long ago.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:27.180]   Yeah.
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.180]   That's forever ago.
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:29.780]   Like our shows are that old.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:30.780]   Oh, geez.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.780]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.780]   Here's the interesting thing.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:34.220]   Bing can find it.
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.220]   Duck, duck, go.
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:38.620]   Can find it.
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.500]   But they all know in Google can't.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.660]   Does stuff fall off the edge?
[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:46.860]   Well, it's possible.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:48.620]   And why not?
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.540]   Does anybody really want to read?
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:53.860]   Brent Simmons's review of the Clash's London Calling from 2008.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.060]   Well, maybe.
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:58.580]   I was trying to find my old TV guide reviews of Opra.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.580]   I couldn't.
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.580]   Just me off.
[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:01.580]   Really?
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:02.580]   There's.
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:03.580]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:06.020]   So I'm going to, so here's what we do, you see.
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:08.140]   Here's the article from Inessential.com.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.740]   It is still on the internet, very publicly.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.700]   I'm going to copy and put in quotes the first sentence.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.660]   And it's a fairly long sentence.
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:18.260]   So that should really narrow it down.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.260]   Let's see.
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.260]   Can we find it?
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.260]   Yes.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:28.100]   Maybe, maybe if I go in incognito mode, maybe, maybe because I visited that site.
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.260]   I was going to say once they linked to it in the site, I think that was probably.
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.060]   Maybe that brought it back to life.
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:37.700]   I'm trying to remember some old stories that I wrote that hit the web and.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.420]   And even incognito.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.820]   So yeah, so maybe.
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:45.020]   So what that does is so I'm doing it in incognito mode and I'm still finding it.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.700]   So do you have that's what you need?
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.260]   Jeff, do you remember?
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.260]   I'm trying to go back.
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:54.940]   I found I found the chugluru right away.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:59.180]   That's a different archive made that wasn't the original.
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.660]   Ah, okay.
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:02.140]   Let's see.
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:06.180]   Yeah, if you search for chugluru.
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:12.820]   All right, let me get out of this incognito tab because it's no good to me.
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.460]   I want to be in the filter bubble.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.860]   I want to.
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:26.460]   So my giga ohm stuff is still archived and that's all the way back to 2008.
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.860]   So now do me a line.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.860]   I'll put it in quotes.
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:33.860]   You know, eight or nine words would be enough.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:39.300]   From one of your articles from 2008 or do you want me to go as far back as you can go?
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:40.740]   Well, that's what I'm trying.
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:48.180]   The problem is my 2005 through 2008, I feel like that publication is dead.
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.180]   You're right.
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.180]   It might not be on the web.
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.180]   No, you're right.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.180]   It might not be on the web.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:53.180]   Yeah.
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:55.180]   So oh, this one's still on the web.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.180]   Okay.
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:57.180]   So then I just need to find just give me a quote.
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.340]   Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.340]   That's that's hard.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.340]   Leo.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.220]   Give me a quote, man.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:07.420]   Um, let me let me look for something and then see if I can find it.
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:08.420]   Here's an article.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:17.660]   Patrick Delahanty has an article from 2005 from the Twit website and, and, uh, Kevin
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:25.580]   Rose wrote it system release party and it's, and he Googled it and he found it.
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:32.300]   So yeah, now we've dragged this along from, from website to website because of course,
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:35.660]   where website's been redesigned at least twice since this article is written.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:38.380]   Well, Google may not think it's old, but ah.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.380]   Mm.
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.340]   Because it got re.
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:42.340]   Mm.
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:43.340]   Okay.
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.740]   Well, something to be aware of.
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:45.900]   So here's, here's one.
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:48.300]   It's always hard to test Google.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.940]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:52.300]   So I have a 2002 post for my blog.
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.300]   Okay.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:54.300]   Okay.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.300]   Hold on.
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:57.860]   Let me, and it's still online, but I have never searched for it and I'm going to an incognito
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:59.180]   window.
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:00.180]   Go ahead.
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.260]   Give me five words, 10, six words from it.
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.260]   Okay.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.260]   Hold on.
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:13.980]   The web lowercase T, the web uppercase W comma, like an old girlfriend is just no fun anymore.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:18.020]   You thought that in 2000 when?
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:19.020]   Two.
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:20.020]   Wow.
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:23.940]   So I found it on my blog.
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:24.940]   Google ain't fine.
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:25.940]   Nope.
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:26.940]   There it is.
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:27.940]   There it is.
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:28.940]   Cool as dead.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.340]   Oh, I found it right away with just five six words.
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:32.420]   Not a bad line.
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:33.420]   The web like an old girlfriend.
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:36.180]   I mean, no, that is a really crappy line.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.380]   Well, it was an old line.
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:38.380]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:39.380]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:40.380]   You're right.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.380]   You're right.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:45.100]   Jeff, I think you want to be on that media that that media man was you're going to get
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.100]   on that spreadsheet.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.100]   You'd be careful.
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.100]   That was them.
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.100]   Okay.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.100]   I never right.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.100]   We raised the spark.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.540]   I actually know I was quoting the New York Times.
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:56.100]   I was quoting the New York Times.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.180]   Like an old boyfriend is no fun anymore.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.100]   I'm like, yeah, you can write that.
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:02.780]   The New York Times is saying that.
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:04.780]   The New York Times is saying.
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:05.780]   Oh, what is he?
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.860]   He's quoting the New York Times.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:15.060]   And you welcome it apparently because the web became too cool too cute too soon.
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:16.060]   Do you go back?
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:18.980]   I mean, here we have a 15 year old are you go back and you haven't read this in ages
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.060]   and look at it and go, yeah, I was pretty good.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.260]   Oh, I also look at things and say, that can't be me.
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.500]   It can't be.
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:28.260]   I think I would say I'm, you know, damn, I'm a good writer, except what's this?
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.260]   How does that come?
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:30.980]   It begins with a colon.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:31.980]   I did that.
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.540]   It was a weird thing that I just did at the time.
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:35.180]   That was my kind of that's how you began.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:37.580]   Rose and get rage because it made no sense.
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:41.700]   But I use colons to break up sections just for the hell of it, just to be different,
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:42.700]   just to be obnoxious.
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:45.220]   Yeah, I used to use weird typography too.
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:51.500]   Remember when we made the last name capital letters on the Twit Lower Thirds?
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.620]   Is just lowercase?
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:56.620]   Nope.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:28:02.500]   On some shows we've reverted to normal capitalization for some reason.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:05.940]   I don't even know why I did that, but it's the same reason you put colons in there.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:08.340]   It's just like jazz it up.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.380]   440 episodes.
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:12.380]   That's what we're.
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:15.580]   Yeah, that's a perfect a.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:22.380]   Oh, giga-ohm took dates off of all of our stuff.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.380]   Now I'm not sure.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:25.060]   That way.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.060]   It's never ages.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:28.580]   Oh, this is aged.
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:29.580]   Let me tell you.
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:32.300]   Oh, but they'll charge you $300 for it.
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:33.300]   Wow.
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:34.300]   Unbelievable.
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.660]   Who owns it?
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:37.660]   Brian.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:38.660]   Some guy.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:39.660]   Reese.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:40.660]   Some guy.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:41.660]   He said, you know what?
[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:43.500]   This is called long tail monetization.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.500]   It's a whole new thing.
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:45.500]   That's what this is.
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.500]   He took a seminar.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.620]   How to monetize the old web.
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:49.620]   Google is.
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.620]   Actually, I think.
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:51.620]   Yeah.
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:52.620]   Go ahead.
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:53.620]   Sorry.
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:54.620]   Go ahead.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:57.900]   For $151 million.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:01.660]   Never liked what Google did with it, which is basically bury it.
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:04.060]   I loved Zagat guides.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.660]   People live in New York and know about Zagat early on, right?
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:07.660]   Right, Jeff?
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:08.660]   Because that was where they started.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:09.660]   Can I say it?
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:10.660]   Zagat.
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:11.660]   How do you say it, Jeff?
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:12.660]   It is Zagat or Zagat.
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:13.660]   Zagat, I think.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.660]   Zagat?
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:15.660]   Okay.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:16.660]   That was a problem.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:17.660]   Nobody could pronounce it.
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:18.660]   I was like, oh, man.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:20.460]   Now I've been pronouncing that wrong my whole life too.
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:22.860]   Because one of Marissa Meyer's last Google acts.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.860]   Oh.
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:25.740]   Or a huge amount of money.
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:26.900]   $151 million.
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:31.380]   I'm glad that Zagat or the Zagat's they're people, right?
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:32.380]   Yeah.
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:34.660]   I'm glad the Zagat's or the Zagat's.
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:37.340]   I think it's Zagat.
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:40.140]   You know, you're asking here.
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:41.140]   Hold up.
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:44.700]   How do you pronounce Zagat?
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:52.580]   Never mind.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:53.580]   Let's ask YouTube.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.580]   Oh, good.
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.580]   How do you pronounce Zagat?
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:58.580]   Oh, Zagat.
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:29:59.580]   Zagat.
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:00.580]   Zagat.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:05.580]   So if you trust Google, I do.
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.580]   They bought it.
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:08.580]   They should know.
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:11.820]   Well, but this was from 2010, a year before they bought it.
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.100]   Anyway, they want to sell it now.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:17.780]   I'm sad because they basically killed it, right?
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:19.220]   Kind of.
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:22.780]   These were those red books, they were red guides.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:28.260]   And the thing that was great, this was pre-internet really, is that it was all the reviews came
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:29.700]   from people.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:33.100]   So if you went to a restaurant, you'd write a Zagat, how do they even get these Zagat
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.100]   reviews?
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.100]   I don't know.
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:36.100]   You'd mail it to them.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.100]   I don't know.
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:39.820]   You'd write a review and then the Zagat would, you'd go to a restaurant page and they would
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:44.380]   have little snippets and would give it a rating.
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:45.380]   What was it from?
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:46.300]   Because Lisa and I used to do this.
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:47.940]   I think from one to 20.
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:48.940]   What is 30?
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:49.940]   One to 30.
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:53.980]   Because like a really good restaurant, it's like a 27 to 28, 29.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:56.780]   And Lisa and I, we would do this all the time, we'd go to restaurants and she'd go,
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:57.780]   I think it's a 23.
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:58.780]   And I'd say, what?
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:30:59.940]   This is easily a 25.
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:01.580]   We'd actually do that.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:02.740]   Which I loved.
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:03.740]   And I trusted Zagat.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:07.940]   One of the things you learned about Zagat is that it was very much conditioned by the
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:09.820]   people in the city.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:14.740]   So Indianapolis's best restaurant wasn't comparable to San Francisco's best restaurant, even
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:18.820]   though they both get a 28 because people in ND liked that restaurant.
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:21.860]   So you just would say, well, I'm getting the locals take on it.
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:23.820]   It was like a great Calvin Trillan piece.
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:26.220]   He said that when they tried to impress him and it's Calvin Trillan, right?
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:28.980]   And the New Yorker loved things like hot dogs and, right.
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:32.340]   But if you'd chill, you'd go to Cleveland, people would have to try to impress him with
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:33.740]   the fanciest restaurant in Cleveland.
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:37.540]   And he said they always served, and this is a quote, stuffed heavy with heavy.
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:38.540]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:43.020]   Yeah, I'll never forget going to the best restaurant in Greenville, South Carolina.
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.740]   It included hush puppies with every course.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:46.740]   I hate you.
[01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:47.740]   Hush puppies are delicious.
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:49.620]   They're delicious, but they're not good for you.
[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:51.700]   And it had with every course.
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.700]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:55.460]   In fact, that's I've had a lot of fun with that.
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:32:01.700]   We went to Detroit actually, Dearborn to visit the Ford folks and they took us to the best
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:04.620]   hamburger restaurant in Dearborn.
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:08.220]   No, and was it good?
[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:10.420]   No, it says a 12.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.860]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:22.260]   But anyway, this is an example of how I feel like the internet bros ruins a gap.
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:27.340]   And they did because they had stuff like Yelp and Google reviews that they thought were
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:31.060]   better and they are patently worse.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.300]   I hate Yelp.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:33.300]   One worse.
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:38.620]   You have to use the app to everybody on it are so freaking spoiled.
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:39.620]   Woof.
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:40.620]   So we, yes.
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:41.620]   That's a really good point.
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:45.700]   So we had this perfect system.
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:50.340]   Dead trees admittedly, but you would go to a city, you'd get this a gat guide and you
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:51.620]   would and you could trust it.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:56.180]   I literally went through the top 10 restaurants in San Francisco, according to the GATT.
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:58.220]   It was great.
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:32:59.220]   And it's true.
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:01.740]   Restaurant nine was a little bit worse than restaurant one.
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:05.340]   I mean, it was accurate.
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:09.740]   So now you pronounce the GATT Yelp.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:10.740]   Thank you, Cobra.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:14.100]   I stole this joke.
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:16.580]   So Google is going to sell the GATT.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.260]   I don't know for how much I guarantee you.
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:20.660]   It's not a hundred fifty one hundred fifty one million dollars.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:24.860]   The GATT was founded in 1979, but Tim and Nina's a GATT.
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:29.420]   Wait, so are those the reviews as part of Google?
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.420]   Aren't they part of the place?
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:36.140]   Yeah, but they didn't, they didn't adopt the system.
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:37.140]   They didn't.
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:38.980]   So you don't get the numbering system.
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:39.980]   They did.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:41.980]   They've mushed it in without an undifferentiated.
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:44.940]   Because we, people like us told them don't go on the content business.
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.300]   And then they owned this content thing.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.900]   They didn't know what to do with it because they weren't in the content business.
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:49.900]   Really is frustrating.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:54.260]   I hate it when companies ruin something that's perfectly good.
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:59.260]   And that's kind of the internet's brand, isn't it?
[01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:00.260]   You know what?
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.260]   It's like an old girlfriend.
[01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:03.260]   Thanks, though.
[01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:04.260]   Thanks a lot, Leo.
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.260]   Thanks a lot.
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:06.260]   I was quoting the new York Times.
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:13.260]   Google's changing how you make money.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:18.500]   Where do we get that thing with the fist in your head?
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:19.500]   What is that happening?
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500]   You don't get one, Jeff.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.500]   Only she gets one.
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:23.980]   My hydrate was supposed to do this.
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:25.580]   But it hasn't happened.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:28.580]   It's not a dual punching thing.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:31.420]   I don't get punches from both sides.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.980]   You could give me a concussion.
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:39.980]   Although that would be pretty funny if you both at the same time hit the button.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:40.980]   Boom.
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:42.980]   Stunned the grip.
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:45.740]   There'll be a slight lag.
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:47.820]   So I'll get stunned for no apparent reason.
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:48.820]   Yeah.
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:49.820]   YouTube is...
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:50.820]   It would be like bad dog training.
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:52.100]   I got my email from YouTube.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:58.020]   Did you, the YouTube partner program, they are changing the requirements for monetization.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.620]   I won't be able to monetize my Leo Laport channel.
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:03.860]   Not that I ever did or wanted to.
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:07.740]   But I imagine a lot of smaller people are going to be upset.
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:11.260]   I can't monetize my channel with all three subscribers.
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:13.060]   If you want to monetize it, you have to.
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:14.060]   These are the requirements.
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:19.700]   You have to have 4,000 hours of viewing time in the last 12 months and 1,000 subscribers.
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:22.780]   That's not a high bar, but it's higher than a lot of calories.
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:28.380]   The entire reason why they're doing this is because they're now going to have a premium
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:32.420]   ad opportunity where they're going to review content better.
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:36.540]   And so I think it's not worth their while to review drags.
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:41.820]   But my daughter was saying on her YouTube VidCon world, there's some fear about this
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:43.220]   because some people may have a lot of views.
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:44.220]   They don't have subscribers.
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:47.820]   So they're going on Twitter begging people to subscribe.
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:49.300]   They're trying.
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.540]   This is Google's response to those weird child videos.
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:53.540]   Exactly.
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:54.460]   Exactly.
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:58.820]   So a subscriber is a good signal, they think.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:01.060]   A thousand is not a lot.
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:02.980]   No, it's not.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:07.420]   But my Twitter TV slash Leo, I mean, YouTube.com slash you look forward.
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:11.820]   But that was always just that was like a personal place where I stuck old videos and stuff.
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:12.820]   I never monetized.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:13.820]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.820]   I don't need to.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:15.820]   I don't need to.
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:16.820]   Let's see how close I am.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:17.820]   Wait a minute.
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:19.620]   I have 3,762 subscribers.
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:23.100]   Oh, but I just don't have very many views.
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:24.100]   I need more views.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:25.100]   Yeah, 4,000.
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:26.980]   You need 4,000 hours.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:30.300]   A, but see, I don't put anything on here.
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:36.620]   The last thing I put on here was six months ago, the Galapagos videos from, but this is
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:39.500]   where I would like put like the 360 degree videos I post.
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:43.060]   I made and stuff like that.
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.420]   I think there's a video of me in the hot tub on one.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.420]   Here's a video.
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:48.020]   You don't remember this Stacy.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.460]   I was bald at one time.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:52.660]   Why would happens?
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:53.660]   I don't know.
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:56.100]   Nobody ever understood what happened.
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:57.940]   No, I shave my head for charity.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:58.940]   Oh, I see that.
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.580]   The worst look ever.
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.860]   It's not an attractive look.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:03.940]   I'm not going to lie.
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:06.580]   I look like Curly in the three stooges.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.100]   That's okay.
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:09.100]   You know what?
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:13.540]   I have done some crazy stuff with my hair, so I'm not going to judge.
[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.980]   Don't ever shave your head.
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:17.940]   Actually, you look like you look like Shinaid O'Connor.
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:18.940]   You'd look fine.
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:19.940]   But if you look-
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:20.940]   Do you have any more tattoos?
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:21.940]   No, just the-
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:23.940]   Do you have tattoos?
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:24.940]   No.
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:29.460]   I used to have a tongue ring, but that's it.
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:30.460]   A tongue ring?
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.460]   How do you talk with that?
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:33.460]   How hard is it?
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:34.460]   A ring?
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:35.460]   A stud.
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:39.300]   No, it was just a stud.
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:40.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:46.300]   At that, my daughter got one when she was too young to know better.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:50.740]   I was kind of upset, but she didn't have any infection and she's removed it and her tongue
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:51.740]   has grown back.
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:52.740]   It grows back, right?
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:53.740]   It does.
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:54.740]   It's kind of cool.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:55.740]   No, it totally grows back.
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:56.740]   Totally grows back.
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:57.740]   There's the risk it'll split.
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:59.740]   There's one problem and you don't want to split.
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.740]   I know.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:03.140]   You do not want to force time.
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:06.740]   There goes my podcasting days right there.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.740]   Especially with your name.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:10.740]   That's the hidden button.
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:11.740]   That's the hidden button.
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:12.740]   That's the hidden button.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:13.740]   That's the hidden button.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:14.740]   You're telling me.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:15.740]   You're telling me.
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:16.740]   You're telling me.
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:17.740]   That's the hidden button.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:18.740]   A challenge.
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.860]   I could tell you the point.
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:25.380]   I could take Jeff Daventh, but I can't take days to hear the about them.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:26.380]   Okay.
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:27.380]   Wow.
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:29.380]   This is one of the highest moments of art.
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:30.380]   It's my 400th video show.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:31.380]   Oh, my God.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:32.380]   What about Google's parental consent?
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:35.700]   I'm like, "Liala for its tongue stud simulator."
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:38.620]   You don't know about that?
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.620]   Okay.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:40.620]   What is it?
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:41.620]   What is it you want to talk about?
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:43.620]   The update on Pro Supervius users.
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:44.620]   Yeah, like anything.
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:49.220]   Let's talk about old girlfriends again.
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:52.020]   Google updating parental control features.
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:57.100]   Just because I saw this as a parent who feels that Google is lacking in their parental
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:58.100]   control division.
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:00.420]   I'm like, "What are they doing?"
[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:02.420]   They're taking it out without replacing it.
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:04.420]   I read this.
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:05.420]   I'm like, "Oh."
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:06.420]   That's what they're doing.
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.420]   What?
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:09.340]   Why would they do that?
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:13.180]   Well, people were really upset when they initially, not when they initially, but they
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:18.180]   had updated some of their user stuff probably a couple of months ago.
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:23.820]   It basically, when your kid was 13, they were kicked off of it.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.900]   So there was nothing like, it was basically like following the DCM.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:29.940]   Yeah, DMCA, yeah.
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:30.940]   DMC.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:31.940]   Kappa, actually.
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:33.700]   The child loan protection of Black Sea Act.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.220]   You say, "Kopa?"
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:36.220]   I say, "Kopa."
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:41.260]   I go, "Kopa, Kopa, Kopa, K-bot, K-bot."
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:42.260]   I say, "Kopa."
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:43.260]   I go, "Kopa, K-bot.
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:44.260]   I'm back there."
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:50.180]   No, no, no, no, not going back there.
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:53.100]   So do you use this for your daughter?
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.340]   I've looked at using it.
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:58.340]   Right now, we don't because we just have safe search on everything and that seems to be
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:39:59.340]   fine.
[01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:02.140]   She's not adventurously browsing for things.
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:08.020]   We've had lots of conversations about how there are things that you can't unsee.
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:10.500]   And so far, that's what...
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.900]   They burn themselves into your brain.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:13.900]   Right.
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:17.940]   Trust me, you do not want them there.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:23.620]   She's pretty both conflict and she does not want to see things.
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:24.980]   She knows she doesn't want to see things.
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:28.100]   So she's like, "Ah, I don't want to see that."
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:30.220]   One thing you'd ever want to see is a bald Leo.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:32.620]   For instance, that's true.
[01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:33.620]   And having seen that now...
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:35.180]   That's a cautionary tale.
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:37.620]   You will never get that out of your brain.
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:40.060]   Oh, no, this is the family link.
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:45.100]   So the email sends people to the Family Link Parent Control Solution, which is the sucky
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:46.100]   one.
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:48.940]   Oh, so they're not getting rid of...
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:50.780]   They have another solution.
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:56.260]   Yeah, so this is the Family Link, which I looked at and I thought it was kind of lame.
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:03.300]   So this is for Android phones and it lets you manage your apps, your screen time limits,
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:04.780]   and stuff like that.
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:09.900]   And it's designed for kids, but once the kid turns 13, it's done.
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:14.180]   Yeah, that's kind of an abrupt evacuation.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:15.180]   That's kind of...
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:16.180]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.180]   I mean, that's kind of how...
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:21.540]   The kid does a search for, I don't know, bald Leo and gets this and then is scarred
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.540]   for life.
[01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:23.540]   Exactly.
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:24.900]   They might turn into a serial killer.
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:26.980]   You never know.
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:29.460]   So yeah, I'm not...
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:32.980]   Karsten, did you censor that?
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.420]   Did you not show that picture?
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:40.980]   No, don't look at your eye.
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:48.180]   If that nose looks normal to you, see, one of the reasons we have here is to distract
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:49.180]   people from the nose.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.180]   I'm saying that.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:52.780]   This, by the way, was when they cleaned up the situation.
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.780]   Yeah, because...
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:55.780]   Yeah, you were there for the initial shaving.
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:57.500]   Was that your shaving of me?
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:58.500]   Was that your shaving of me?
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:41:59.500]   New Year's Eve.
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:00.500]   New Year's Eve.
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:01.500]   We had a big party.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:02.500]   I never wanted to do a New Year's Eve show with you.
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:03.500]   Don't ever...
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:04.500]   That's the world of this lesson.
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:09.420]   I shaved Jeff's beard poorly and shaved my dome poorly and then I went to a barber thank
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:11.620]   God and she cleaned it up.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.900]   Look at that with a straight razor.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:15.900]   It was actually...
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.980]   Yeah, well, no, it was awesome.
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:24.380]   She wrapped my head in hot towels and it was very old fashioned and she did a bowl with
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:28.100]   a brush and lather it up and it was fun.
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:31.940]   And then when they shave your head with a straight razor, there's a...
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:34.940]   No, it's just eating.
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:38.540]   All right, you can pull that down.
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:39.540]   No, nobody...
[01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:42.340]   You're singing the Sweeney Todd song the whole time?
[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:47.100]   Here's a blurry but effective image of me shaving Jeff.
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:50.740]   He did not enjoy that.
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:53.300]   By the way, thank you Google.
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:56.220]   I searched for barber in my Google photos.
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.020]   Have you found that?
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:42:59.460]   And I found these.
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:01.540]   Poor Jeff.
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:04.140]   You were so understanding.
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:08.980]   Well, you were more weak because you got talked into more and more and more.
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:10.300]   The tattoo being the...
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.300]   Yeah, we raised...
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:12.300]   Lisa was not happy.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.140]   How many of you do we raise for Unicef?
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:15.620]   $80,000 or something like that.
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:16.620]   Thanks to all of you.
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:17.620]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.940]   And by the way, it's probably the first and last time you'll be shaved by a barber in a
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:21.940]   tuxedo.
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:22.940]   Yes.
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:23.940]   Just saying.
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:26.860]   Are you ever going to the show again or no?
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:28.300]   I really would like to.
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:32.540]   But I think it's just...I think I might die if I did.
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:33.540]   And I know my...
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.700]   Because Stacey Leo stayed up for 24 hours.
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:35.700]   It was 24 hours.
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.700]   So, with the idea...
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:37.700]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:38.700]   The horror.
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:39.700]   The horror.
[01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:46.940]   The idea was that...I had this brainstorm because one night, one New Year's Eve, we were watching,
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:51.940]   you know, the...to Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve, he was still alive.
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:55.900]   And we were watching it and it's in New York City, but we're on the West Coast.
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:58.460]   And at 9 p.m., the ball drops.
[01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:00.100]   And it's over.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.100]   And it's like...
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:04.060]   No, but we got three more hours till New Year's Eve.
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:05.060]   But no, it's over.
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:06.060]   New Year's Eve in New York, it's over.
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:07.060]   So, I thought...
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:08.060]   That's all the letters.
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:13.900]   What we should do, and as an international broadcaster, is start celebrating when it's
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:18.540]   the New Year in Samoa and go all the way through till the New Year in Hawaii.
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:19.540]   And we did...
[01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:20.900]   You did 24 hours on the air?
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:21.900]   You did really good.
[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:25.860]   We did every hour a ball drop and a champagne pop and balloon drop.
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:29.500]   We had a...we had...we did it twice.
[01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:34.860]   We had John rigged the ceiling so I could drop the balloons and then after the balloons
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:37.020]   dropped because we had to do another one an hour, we'd go...
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:41.500]   And then pull them back up to the ceiling.
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.700]   The first time they went in mass and it didn't really work.
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:45.500]   So the next year, we had...
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:53.780]   He made hundreds of individual fishing line suspended balloons.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:54.780]   We pulled back up to the roof.
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:55.780]   That's right.
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:56.780]   I forgot about that.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:57.780]   It was so much fun.
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:58.780]   I really enjoyed doing it.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:44:59.780]   It was great fun.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:01.500]   I still think it's a brilliant idea and maybe the way to do this...
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:02.780]   And we did it for charity, which is great.
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:03.780]   We raised a lot of money.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:05.900]   But I think the way to do this in future was to get...
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.780]   Would be to get all the podcasters together.
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:08.780]   You know what I mean?
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:11.180]   You should get hosts to do like a six hour shift.
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.540]   Yeah, we're an hour.
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:14.260]   Everybody does an hour in their region.
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:15.260]   We did get Skype calls.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:16.940]   We tried to get Skype calls from every region.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:18.540]   We got them from many regions.
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:20.700]   But there are some places that are uninhabited.
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:24.300]   Who's watching the ball drop there?
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.300]   Right.
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:29.300]   But the fun was like Sydney, which is way before we have it in the US.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.300]   Oh yeah.
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.300]   That fireworks is wonderful.
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:32.300]   It's really wonderful.
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.300]   All right.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:34.300]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:35.300]   We had that strange dinner.
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:36.300]   Oh, was that that year?
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:37.300]   Yeah, that was that year.
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:38.300]   Yeah, I think it was.
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.500]   Yeah, that was our Christmas.
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:40.500]   That was terrible.
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:41.500]   That was your Christmas.
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:42.500]   That's right.
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:43.500]   That was your Christmas.
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:44.500]   Yes.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:45.500]   Don't...
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:46.500]   Oh, I'm pleased.
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:47.500]   Don't remind.
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.500]   I feel so bad about that, Jeff.
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.700]   It was funny.
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:52.060]   We flew out all the hosts.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.900]   This will never happen again.
[01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:56.180]   We thought, well, they came to Petaluma.
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:59.020]   We should go to a classic Petaluma place.
[01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:03.660]   In Austin, if you were going to take them to the quintessential Austin place, would it
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:05.260]   be the Salt Lake or somewhere?
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:07.780]   Probably the Salt Lake.
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:13.220]   So I didn't know this, but we took them to the Washoe House, which was an old rolled
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:22.100]   house, a 150-year-old roadhouse that used to have good food.
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:23.100]   It was fried with fried.
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:25.100]   It was worse than that.
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:28.100]   They had vegetables, but they were just gone awful.
[01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:29.900]   Oh, it was just terrible.
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:30.900]   So fun.
[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:31.900]   It became a shtick.
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:32.900]   Of course.
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:33.900]   It was a big shtick.
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:35.340]   I still feel very guilty about it.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:36.340]   No, you should not.
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.340]   That was great.
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:38.340]   It's great.
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:44.060]   Facebook has created something called Watch Party to watch videos with your friends.
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:45.820]   Is this what you're talking about?
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:46.820]   Yeah.
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:47.820]   Well, that's part of it.
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:48.820]   No, no, that's just part of it.
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:52.980]   That's part of them trying to make video less a solitary...
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:54.740]   I think that's kind of a fun idea.
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:55.740]   Situation.
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:56.740]   I think it is too.
[01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:57.740]   So...
[01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:01.540]   I don't know how it works.
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:03.500]   Oh, well, I don't know how this works.
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.500]   I think watching videos with your friends remotely is a good idea.
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:07.500]   Really?
[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:12.420]   I used to call friends up and we would queue up a movie together and we would just sit
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:14.820]   on the phone and watch a movie together.
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:16.580]   And how did that feel good?
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.580]   That was that like...
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:18.580]   Yeah, because like...
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:21.220]   It's true science theater of 3,000.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:22.220]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:23.820]   Or you could just be...
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:26.500]   I mean, it's like the idea of being in a theater.
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:30.780]   When something scary happens, you can hear the person go...
[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:31.780]   Yes.
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:33.900]   You know what you do?
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:36.940]   You watch Get Out with people who haven't seen it before.
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:39.980]   Dad, have you seen it?
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:40.980]   I have.
[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:41.980]   Oh, shoot.
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:44.660]   I was gonna suggest we do this on the air.
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:45.660]   No.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:47.180]   Let's all start watching Get Out.
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:49.460]   Because that's one of those movies where you go...
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:50.460]   What?
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:51.460]   What?
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:52.460]   What?
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:56.460]   Twitter stock at two-year high.
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:57.460]   Yay.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:01.460]   Don't know what that even...
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:03.460]   That's the right reaction.
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:05.860]   What is the impact?
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.460]   High fly in Twitter stock.
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:09.460]   What's it doing differently?
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:12.100]   What did I hit on my skin?
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:13.700]   One word.
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:14.700]   Trump.
[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:15.700]   Yeah.
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:16.700]   That's all.
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.700]   Seriously.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:18.700]   Yeah.
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:26.180]   When you have the leader of the free world, free associating on your service at all hours
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:31.580]   of the day and night, why wouldn't your stock go through the roof?
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:40.300]   I mean, that's like having to be to fly on the wall in the Oval Office.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:46.140]   Bitcoin having a little bit of a trouble.
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:47.140]   A little tummy.
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:50.220]   I think I'm finally in the negative.
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:54.260]   A suicide prevention hotline according to Motherboard was the top post in the cryptocurrency
[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:55.260]   subreddit yesterday.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.260]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:57.260]   It's that bad.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:58.260]   What about...
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:48:59.260]   I suggest being...
[01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:00.260]   That's a...
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:01.260]   Funny.
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:02.260]   Coinmarketcap.com.
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:03.260]   Bitcoin's in $1,000.
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:14.180]   Well, for those of us that can't get into our Bitcoin wallet, it's kind of like...
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:15.940]   Like not bad news.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:16.940]   It's less important.
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:17.940]   Watch in the world.
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:18.940]   Go buy.
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:19.940]   Go up in that.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:20.940]   Will it go...
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:22.220]   So, okay, you smarty pants.
[01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:23.940]   Will it go up again?
[01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:24.940]   Yeah.
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:25.940]   Stacy.
[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:26.940]   My son.
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:31.540]   I'm like human... human shruggy right here.
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:33.940]   I'm like, I don't even know this device.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:37.100]   Did you read the New York Times article on the...
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:38.100]   What was it?
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:41.260]   Everyone's getting hilariously rich except you.
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:42.740]   Yes.
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:45.500]   Nelly strikes again.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:47.300]   Is her real name Nelly Bowles?
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.300]   Yeah.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:49.780]   Or is that a pseudonym?
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:50.780]   It...
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:53.620]   Because there's a very famous Nelly Bowles.
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:55.380]   There is a very famous one, yes.
[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:57.660]   Everyone is getting hilarious, really rich and you're not.
[01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:00.460]   It's the story of the Bitcoin bros.
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:05.860]   Guys who are making fortunes because they had the intelligence or good luck to buy Bitcoin
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:13.540]   really cheaply and a lot of it a few years ago, the wealth she writes is intoxicating
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:17.660]   news feverish because it seems so random.
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:18.660]   And she visits the...
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:20.540]   What is it called?
[01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:23.540]   The Crypto Castle?
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:26.700]   Where these Bitcoin bros live?
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:31.620]   The Crypto Castle's King is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:36.820]   has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:38.500]   Early one afternoon he opened a bottle of...
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:39.500]   This could have been on Twitter.
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:43.380]   He opened a bottle of rosé while he charged half a dozen external batteries.
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:47.460]   So he wouldn't have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza the next week.
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:49.020]   "Hi, do I see yous?
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:50.940]   It's my thing," he said.
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:53.740]   He wore a pink button front and pink pants.
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:54.740]   It's me...
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:56.580]   He wore a pink button front and pink pants.
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:51:00.860]   It's me, a couple VCs and a lot of charlatans.
[01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:01.860]   This...
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:03.460]   Look at the refrigerator with all the stickers.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:05.460]   Where's the twit sticker on here?
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:06.460]   The guy...
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:07.860]   Yeah, you may not be popular with Bitcoin bros.
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:10.060]   I might not be.
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:13.860]   About eight people live in the Crypto Castle on any given night.
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:17.540]   Some of Mr. Gardner's tenants brought out snacks, Cheez-Its and a jar of Nutella.
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:18.540]   Ooh, ooh.
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:19.540]   Gross!
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.620]   They're into the Cheez-It Nutella thing.
[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:22.620]   Ooh.
[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:24.780]   One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:27.220]   But I bet there's no women in there.
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:30.060]   Mr. Gardner leaned back into the sofa and rested his feet on the table.
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:33.460]   He recently did an ICO for a startup after party.
[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.340]   You can an ICO anything, he said.
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:36.780]   I see he probably talks like this.
[01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:39.100]   You can an ICO anything.
[01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:40.300]   He runs a distributed...
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:44.820]   He runs distributed at 180 page magazine about cryptocurrency that comes out once a year.
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:46.540]   That's not a magazine.
[01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:53.460]   He's now raising $75 million for his hedge fund.
[01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:58.380]   Awesome ventures spelled A-U-S-U-M.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:01.380]   Awesome ventures.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:05.220]   He said his closest friends are moving to Puerto Rico to get around paying taxes.
[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:08.780]   "They're going to build a modern day at Linus out there," he said.
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:11.340]   For me, it's too early in my career to check out.
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:13.660]   Remember, he's 25.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:14.780]   I hate this guy.
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:16.580]   This is why people hate Silicon Valley.
[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:17.580]   Yeah.
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:25.180]   But look, this is another place, the crypto crack house, where they've named the hallways
[01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:33.340]   things like "Coin-Yi West" and "Bitcoin Boulevard" and "Ethereum Alley."
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:37.780]   Oh, I can't wait for this bubble to pop.
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:40.860]   I cannot wait for this bubble to pop.
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:45.300]   This is by the way, do you know Nelly because she deserves a Pulitzer for this?
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:47.100]   She does good work.
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:52.980]   She also wrote, though, that New York Times article on sexism in the Valley that normalized
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:53.980]   sexism.
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:54.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:58.020]   It's okay because everybody's doing it.
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:03.220]   It was more like it was the MRA people at different...
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:07.660]   She interviewed Ben's rights activists at different companies.
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:11.860]   It was the quotes about, "You don't see women as the CEO of car companies.
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:14.780]   Why would they expect them to be at CEO tech companies?"
[01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:17.540]   Well, she's just quoting these doofuses, I hope it was...
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:18.540]   I know.
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:24.020]   But the controversy was, why would you put an article like that without any alternative?
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:29.420]   It's not as bad as talking about Neo-Nazi's favorite food.
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:35.100]   And I think Nelly also did the raw water thing.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.100]   Last week, the top culture.
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:37.620]   You know, we've got to get her in here.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.620]   She's in San Francisco.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:40.980]   She's got to be a pseudonym.
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:45.380]   Or else her parents have a real good sense of humor.
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:53.860]   Nelly Bowles was the woman who tried to beat Phineas Fog's record for going around the
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.180]   world, right?
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:56.940]   Or am I...?
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:57.940]   Am I...
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:58.940]   Am I actually British?
[01:53:58.940 --> 01:53:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:04.220]   Unfortunately, the new Nelly is so famous that...
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:06.220]   There's no...
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:08.220]   Yeah, there's no...
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.660]   Nothing of the old Nelly.
[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:12.980]   But she was a famous...
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:15.900]   Maybe I'm mistaken?
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:17.980]   Am I getting the name wrong?
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:19.540]   No, no, you're right.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:21.140]   I don't know any of this.
[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:28.100]   Yeah, because you're too young to remember the Nelly Bowles who went around the world.
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:33.580]   Meanwhile, my favorite headline of the week, she worked at Recode.
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:35.580]   Yeah, she worked at Recode.
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:36.580]   And the Guardian.
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:37.580]   And the Guardian.
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:38.580]   All right.
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:39.580]   And I think...
[01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:43.580]   Well, I'm not going to say Fulbright fellow Tusswaziland.
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:45.580]   She's the real thing.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:47.580]   Tusswaziland.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.580]   Tusswaziland.
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:51.580]   That's probably where she learned her trenchant prose.
[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:52.580]   No.
[01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:55.580]   Sally Bowles was in Cabaret.
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:56.580]   That's a different Bowles.
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:57.580]   That's right.
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:58.580]   Sally Bowles.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:54:59.580]   Maybe it's one thing enough.
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:00.580]   No, no, no.
[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:01.580]   There was...
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:02.580]   I know, I know.
[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:03.580]   It's not Nelly Bowles.
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:07.580]   Maybe it's something Nelly, something else.
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:08.580]   Nelly Bligh.
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:11.100]   That's who I'm confusing it with.
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:12.100]   Thank you, Google.
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:13.100]   Sally Bowles and Nelly Bligh.
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:14.100]   Okay.
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:15.820]   Sally Bowles and Nelly Bligh makes Nelly Bowles.
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:16.820]   All right.
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:19.580]   Let's wrap it up with our picks of the week.
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:22.940]   And then I hope you Stacey have prepared something fabulous.
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:25.460]   Fabulous for us.
[01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:27.700]   And for dinner.
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:34.980]   So I have a question.
[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:35.940]   I can take you on the road with me to show it to you in person or I posted it on Instagram.
[01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:36.940]   Take us on the road.
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:37.940]   Take us on the road.
[01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:38.940]   Okay.
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:45.100]   So Karsten, that means I'm going to switch from the nice camera and the nice mic to my
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:46.700]   headphone mic and other things.
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:49.700]   We have no idea how this is going to work.
[01:55:49.700 --> 01:55:50.700]   Okay.
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:51.700]   But let's see it.
[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:54.700]   Can we see your wig collection while you're there?
[01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:55.700]   Nope.
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:56.700]   Okay.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:57.700]   Okay.
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:00.980]   Why don't you guys go first and that way I can tell my family members to get out of
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:02.460]   the way if they don't want to be on camera?
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.460]   Wow.
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:04.460]   Aren't you thoughtful?
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:06.460]   I just forced my family members to be on camera.
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:08.940]   I didn't ever tell them to get out of the way.
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:12.460]   Said you're on.
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:13.460]   Let's start.
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:15.100]   I don't know if I have anything this week.
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:17.140]   I'm thinking now.
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:19.300]   Thinking about I had things.
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:22.460]   I could show you how to make an Android phone black and white.
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:24.100]   Oh, you did show us that.
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:25.300]   And you showed us about.
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:26.300]   I've used.
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:27.300]   Okay.
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:28.300]   I just I just warned them.
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:29.300]   They're fine.
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:30.300]   Okay.
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:31.300]   All right.
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:36.300]   You turn off your mic and go, Hey, I'm coming down the hall out of the way.
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:38.540]   No, I just I am.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:40.300]   We can now see the rest of Stacy's room.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:42.300]   We've never seen this before.
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:43.540]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:44.900]   This looks really nice.
[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:46.820]   It's not the sterile room.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:48.700]   We see the we see the boring half.
[01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:50.700]   Right.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:51.700]   You guys.
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:52.900]   That's that's the part that I look at.
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:53.900]   That's so nice.
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:58.500]   Oh, we're also tested my Wi-Fi.
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:01.900]   Oh, I like that.
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:05.380]   So it's pretty painting a sunny sunny flower painting.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:07.100]   I need my phone.
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:08.100]   Sorry, you guys.
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:09.100]   How are you?
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.900]   How are you even doing this?
[01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:13.100]   I'm walking down the hall with my laptop.
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:14.100]   This is magical.
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:16.100]   Oh, it's amazing.
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:17.100]   What has God wrought?
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:18.100]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:19.100]   You're back in the office.
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.100]   I have to get my phone to control the device.
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:22.100]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:24.020]   I'm so confused.
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:25.380]   I was getting lost.
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:26.900]   I mean, breadcrubs.
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:28.900]   We're getting lost in Stacy's house.
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:29.900]   OK.
[01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:32.700]   He loves that because he has two of those sunflowers.
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:33.700]   Yeah.
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:34.700]   Yeah, I love those.
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:35.700]   Yeah.
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.700]   Yeah, you probably have a whole field somewhere.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:38.700]   All right.
[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:41.700]   I feel like we should be playing the Texas theme right now.
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:42.700]   She's processing.
[01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:43.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:44.700]   I can do that.
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:45.700]   I'm really.
[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:46.700]   I'm really.
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:47.700]   Okay.
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:49.500]   Oh, you can't see the colors.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.500]   Yes, we can.
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:51.500]   Did you get those?
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:52.500]   You got them.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:53.500]   I'm so jealous.
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.500]   So this is the nanolights.
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:58.100]   This is all the rage.
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:57:59.100]   These nanolights.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:00.100]   Yes.
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:05.500]   And I'm sorry that the color isn't really coming through well, but it looks amazing
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:07.500]   in person and let's.
[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:08.500]   So cool.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:13.700]   So the idea is these can be put together in a variety of ways.
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:15.900]   Oh, thanks.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:18.900]   So this is.
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:19.900]   This is.
[01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:20.900]   This is.
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:21.900]   Green.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:22.900]   This is my favorite.
[01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:25.300]   This is orange that will come up, but you may not see it.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:26.300]   I'll see it as orange.
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:27.900]   I want to know more about these nanolights.
[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:31.620]   We had a caller on the new screensabers who had them, but they I thought this was this
[01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:33.540]   is like the latest thing.
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:34.540]   There you go.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:36.700]   They were the hottest gift for Christmas.
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:37.900]   Oh, okay.
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:39.900]   Or a hot gift at Christmas.
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:42.220]   There's a is it nano leaf?
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:43.500]   It's the nano leaf light.
[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:46.100]   So each of these triangles is an LED.
[01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:49.060]   Yeah, one controller controls 30 triangles.
[01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:50.500]   These are 15 right here.
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:51.500]   Okay.
[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:53.300]   The main pack has.
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:54.300]   Let's see.
[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:55.500]   What does the main pack have?
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:57.900]   So it's the pattern you chose to put up.
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:58:58.900]   Yes.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:58:59.900]   Mm hmm.
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:00.900]   Okay.
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:05.100]   So this is firework in it'll firework every time I'm saying something and that's it.
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:07.780]   It comes with something called the rhythm module.
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:09.700]   So you could play music.
[01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:13.300]   Alexa play Hamilton.
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:14.300]   Let's see.
[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:15.300]   The music.
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:16.300]   The music.
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.300]   I'm going to go.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.300]   Wow.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.100]   Your Lexus smart in the mind.
[01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:24.700]   I have to actually say Hamilton original gas soundtrack 2017.
[01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:26.700]   She's still telling me who's on this.
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:28.900]   I've gone a long time.
[01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:30.500]   It's easy to spot the five.
[01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:32.500]   Oh my God.
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:38.300]   Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:42.500]   That's one of the better light music lights for the things I've ever seen.
[01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:43.700]   There's a different pattern.
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:47.340]   So I'm kind of I'm I know I'm going to get depressed.
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:49.900]   How much do these cost?
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:51.700]   How much do they cost?
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:52.700]   Alexa step.
[01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:54.220]   $229.29.
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:55.220]   For nine panels.
[01:59:55.220 --> 02:00:03.700]   And then it's the dance module.
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:05.900]   The dancing model now comes with the main one.
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:06.900]   Oh, good.
[02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:09.300]   Oh, it includes the rhythm upgrade model.
[02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:10.300]   Yeah.
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:12.700]   You could have up to 30 panels total.
[02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:14.900]   So you have to think about what you want to do.
[02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:16.220]   Well, now you can.
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:17.540]   It's just on a power strip.
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:19.140]   So or on a power.
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:20.140]   On the power cord.
[02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:21.620]   So you could actually put more together.
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:25.540]   You just need more power converter transformers.
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:27.660]   Oh, so the controller can handle more than 30.
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:28.660]   It's the power.
[02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:33.140]   Well, the controller is.
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:35.940]   No, you need a whole separate.
[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:38.540]   You need a controller for each 30.
[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:39.540]   Yes.
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:40.940]   I don't know why I'm asking.
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:41.940]   I'm asking.
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:43.740]   Does it what?
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:46.660]   Does it coordinate across the multiple controllers?
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:48.700]   I think so, actually.
[02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:50.860]   I think there's a way to hook that up.
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:57.340]   Because you see a lot of bar setups and at CES they had a massive setup that was coordinated.
[02:00:57.340 --> 02:00:58.660]   So how is it?
[02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:03.060]   How hard was this to install to hang on the wall?
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:04.740]   It's command tape.
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:06.700]   It's 3M command tape.
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:11.900]   So you just stick it on the wall.
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:13.900]   Oh, man.
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.740]   And then you can redo it.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:18.380]   So here I'll take you back up to the office.
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:22.300]   So my family can come out of wherever they're hiding.
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:23.300]   Hello family.
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:26.060]   They can't use family.
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:31.060]   So it looks like I found it on Amazon for less, 219.
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:32.060]   I don't know though.
[02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:34.020]   Does it have the rhythm module?
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:35.020]   Yeah.
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:36.500]   Oh, maybe not.
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:37.500]   Maybe that's the difference.
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:39.180]   Because I think that's like 30 bucks.
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:40.180]   Yeah.
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:44.020]   So if you want to see the sunset.
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:46.540]   On a no leaf or in the real world.
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:47.540]   Oh, can you see the sunset?
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:48.540]   What a view.
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:49.540]   Look at that great view you have.
[02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:51.540]   Oh, you can't see the sunset.
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:52.540]   My head's in the way.
[02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:54.180]   Yeah, I could sort of see it.
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:55.180]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:01:56.180]   It's really nice.
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:57.180]   It's beautiful.
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:02:00.340]   That's a nice, what a great view of the sunset.
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:03.220]   So do you like, are you giving a positive review to the nano leaf?
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:04.220]   Do you like them?
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:05.220]   I am.
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:06.220]   I like them.
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:07.220]   They're fancy.
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:08.220]   They're fun.
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:09.220]   Your kids will love them.
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:11.660]   They're not a practical.
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:14.340]   When you're spending this money, this is purely like the same kind of money you would
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:17.500]   spend on like, I don't know, pictures for your house.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:20.220]   As opposed to like, light.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:24.580]   It feels a little limited only because, you know, it's these triangles.
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:27.340]   You can only do things that you could do with the triangle.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:30.180]   So it's CES starting in fall.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:32.700]   They will have touch sensitive squares.
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:35.300]   And again, that is on my Instagram.
[02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:39.900]   I sat up, but I'm excited because I'm a goofus.
[02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:41.100]   So.
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:43.300]   Are you gigastacey on Instagram?
[02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:44.300]   I'm Higgenbob.
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:48.020]   Oh, no, I'm Stacy and IOT.
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:51.700]   I should know because we showed it the last week when you thank you, by the way, for joining
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:52.700]   us last.
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:53.700]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:54.700]   That was great.
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:55.700]   That was perfect.
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:57.300]   Perfect timing and you and you.
[02:02:57.300 --> 02:02:58.300]   Out of appearance.
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:02:59.300]   Yeah.
[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:00.300]   The one right under there it is.
[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:01.620]   Oh, no, no, no.
[02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:02.980]   The touch one is this one here.
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:03.980]   Yeah.
[02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:07.460]   Oh, that's kind of neat.
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:09.500]   Oh, isn't that fun?
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:13.900]   Oh, so she touches it and goes.
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:14.900]   Wow.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:19.300]   So somebody says, what's the application for this?
[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:20.300]   It's decorative.
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:21.620]   Like I said, it's like pictures.
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:26.420]   So if you would spend money on pictures and art in your house.
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:28.420]   Here's my nerdy idea.
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:29.460]   I'd have to get enough of them.
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:32.420]   I want to do the game of life, Conway's game of life on these.
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:37.020]   You'd have to write a program probably and you need a lot of them or there would be a
[02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:38.340]   very boring game of life.
[02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:40.780]   You know about the game of life?
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:44.980]   The one with the car that you drive around and little tiny people?
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:46.380]   It's an old, it comes from scientific.
[02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:47.380]   It's an old geek thing.
[02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:48.380]   I mean, really old.
[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:51.060]   Only old, old geeks would get it.
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:53.580]   Let me just show you an example.
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:55.980]   It's a cellular automation.
[02:03:55.980 --> 02:03:58.380]   But see, what is this is huge?
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:00.380]   How big would this have to be?
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:03.540]   I want to play this game.
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:08.420]   I can make a, you can make a pretty small grid, right?
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:09.420]   Let's make a glider.
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:10.900]   You see the glider moves?
[02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:13.780]   Be really fun to make this out of that.
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:18.660]   But this is a huge, this would cost thousands of dollars.
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:21.100]   But I bet you somebody with a lot of money is going to do something like that.
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.980]   That'd be fun to have on the wide, but on the wall here.
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:26.580]   You can tell them to.
[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:28.500]   You can tell the nanoleaf people too.
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:32.300]   If you got a bunch of skills living right there, they do stuff because they got them.
[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:33.300]   They got a lot of them.
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:34.300]   Right.
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.300]   They can do and that's their marketing.
[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:38.900]   It's kind of fun to do this.
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:43.180]   I want light up Legos doing that.
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:45.180]   Light up Legos.
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:46.420]   All right.
[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:48.260]   Very nice things, Stace.
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:50.220]   So there's your thing.
[02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:51.220]   Thank you.
[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:52.220]   Super fun.
[02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:54.180]   No practical purpose whatsoever.
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:58.380]   And you can also control them from Madam A.
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:00.700]   So I could, oh.
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:01.700]   Yeah.
[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:04.660]   But what commands does Madam A have?
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:06.580]   She turns them on and off.
[02:05:06.580 --> 02:05:09.740]   I think she also theoretically recognizes scenes.
[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:14.060]   However, when I ask her to do a scene, she does not respond well.
[02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:19.820]   So that is one of those things where I'm like, maybe I haven't trouble shot at that because
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:22.940]   I got back from CES on Friday and.
[02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:24.380]   Can you buy them in bulk?
[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:27.420]   Can you get like, can you get a wholesale?
[02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:32.100]   Like if I called them because they say I'd like 400 of them and get a deal.
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:34.060]   You could try.
[02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:39.340]   They did the show on one of their pages, a bar that the face of the bar is just these
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:40.340]   lights.
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:41.340]   Yeah.
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:44.540]   Because to do a game of life, you need 20 by 20, at least, I think, to bake it at all
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:46.220]   interesting.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:52.060]   I still don't know what the game of life is, but I'm going to look it up.
[02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:54.900]   Look up, well, you look up Conway's game of life.
[02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:57.020]   That's the, that's the real one.
[02:05:57.020 --> 02:06:03.540]   And now we give you our number of the week for Mr. Professor Jeffrey G. Jarvis.
[02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:06.980]   So I have two left.
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:12.700]   Apple's going to reprieve $38 billion in the tax.
[02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:13.700]   That's out of what?
[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:14.700]   220?
[02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:15.700]   200 plus, yeah.
[02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:17.500]   40 like that.
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:21.180]   But the more interesting than that, I thought was this, BlackRock, which is the largest investment
[02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:26.780]   firm out there with four all of our 401ks and such, sent a letter to, is sending a letter
[02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:31.300]   to the companies that invest in saying contribute to society or risk losing our support.
[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:34.140]   They have $6 trillion in investments.
[02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:35.140]   It's good.
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:38.660]   And 401ks exchange traded funds, mutual funds and such.
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:39.660]   Good.
[02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:43.500]   As such, they are the largest investor in the world and have outsized influence as the
[02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:44.500]   New York Times.
[02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:46.580]   You know, thus, this is great.
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:47.580]   Forget the Paris Accord.
[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:49.500]   Just get BlackRock to do it.
[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:52.660]   Society quote from their letter, "society is demanding the companies, both public and
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:55.780]   private, serve a social purpose to prosper over time.
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:58.740]   Every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:01.980]   positive contribution to society."
[02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:04.540]   So right on, that's nice.
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:06.060]   I hope there's serious about it.
[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:07.060]   I hope there are two.
[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:09.820]   And what's the definition of positive influence we shall see?
[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:13.540]   But what's the negative we shall see?
[02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:17.060]   I'm going to point you, this isn't a really a thing, but I am going to point you an article
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:19.140]   that everybody should read.
[02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:24.580]   This is from Atlantic Magazine, Alexis Madrigal with this great stuff.
[02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:27.020]   By the way, he was one of the people who went to Fusion, right?
[02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:28.020]   Is Fusion gone?
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:29.020]   Fusion?
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:34.940]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's now called Splinter and it's part of the Fusion Media
[02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:37.940]   Group at Univision.
[02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:43.820]   Yeah, Univision started it, but they hired the roots.
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:49.740]   They hired Kevin Ruse, they hired Alexis Madrigal, they hired great people who's, you
[02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:50.740]   know, I can't...
[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:52.300]   I feel like Sammon.
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:58.020]   Who's the woman who wrote the, about the toilet in Kansas?
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:01.420]   Anyway, so it's still a...
[02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:02.420]   Cashmere Hill.
[02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:03.420]   Cashmere Hill.
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:05.020]   Love all of these people.
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:09.620]   Some of the best tech journalists or journalists in general, but tech-focused journalists.
[02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:11.020]   And now they're writing for other things.
[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:12.660]   Sounds like they're not kept busy.
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:15.580]   I don't know.
[02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:21.380]   Anyway, Alexis writes about the strange brands in your Instagram feed.
[02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:27.540]   See, he bought this fine looking West Lewis jacket.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:32.020]   It all started with an Instagram ad for a coat, the West Lewis businessman windproof long
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:33.020]   coat.
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:35.220]   It looked like a decent camel coat, not fancy, but fine.
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:38.500]   And I've been looking for one just that color.
[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:42.380]   So when the ad touting the coat hopped up and the price was in the double digits, "Hey,
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:44.060]   don't question his taste."
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:46.340]   I figured, "Hey, a deal."
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:49.980]   The brand West Lewis seemed like another one of the small clothing companies that has
[02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:54.020]   me tagged in the vast Facebook advertising ecosystem as someone who wants...
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:55.420]   Ooh, did Amazon own it?
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:56.420]   Sorry.
[02:08:56.420 --> 02:08:58.420]   No, this is far worse.
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:08:59.420]   Okay.
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:01.020]   But that's what he thought.
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:05.340]   Like Faraday, Birdwell, Beach, Britches, Life After Denim.
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:09.100]   So perhaps the copy on the West Lewis site was a little much claiming West Lewis is the
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:13.660]   perfection of modern gentleman clothing, but in a world where an oil company can claim
[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:18.620]   to fuel connections, who was I a default a small entrepreneur for some purple prose.
[02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:23.060]   Four weeks later, the coat showed up in a black plastic bag emblazoned with the markings
[02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:25.340]   of China Post that nation's postal service.
[02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:27.820]   I tore it open and pulled out the coat.
[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:34.780]   The material has the softness of a Las Vegas carpet and the rich sheen of a velour jumpsuit.
[02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:39.340]   The fabric is so synthetic, it could probably be refried at the bunker fuel for a ship.
[02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:44.060]   It was technically the item I ordered only shabbier than I expected in every aspect.
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:49.980]   It turns out, and you can watch this video for a 17 year old from Scotland where again,
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:58.060]   that people are creating basically dropshipping companies advertising on Facebook and Instagram.
[02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:00.460]   And there are all the tools out there.
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:07.460]   This kid shows you how to use Shopify and a bunch of Shopify plugins to generate traffic.
[02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:09.980]   Madrigal calls them the Bob Ross of e-commerce.
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:18.140]   Yeah, we buy stuff and the weirdest stuff comes through these companies too.
[02:10:18.140 --> 02:10:22.140]   But be careful, because it's not all great stuff, right?
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:27.340]   Well, so they not only do they do this highly optimized advertising to catch the Kipster type
[02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:30.940]   people, they also just do arbitrage against pricing.
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:34.380]   So sometimes when you order something, so that's when we catch them.
[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:37.820]   We catch them when we've done lowest price for a good.
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:43.180]   And then we get like, I think we bought some canned air that came via.
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:47.340]   I think increasingly, and this happens on Amazon too, you're going to have to be very careful
[02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:51.180]   about what you're buying and who you're buying it from.
[02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:52.460]   There's all these Shopify plugins.
[02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:56.540]   There's one called Oberlo, which allows you to pull products directly from AliExpress.
[02:10:56.540 --> 02:11:01.260]   Click a button and something goes manufactured in the Chinese hinterlands, becomes an item
[02:11:01.260 --> 02:11:04.620]   for sale in an Irish kids website.
[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:11.180]   So you literally know work the one by hand thing that he would have to do, which is the actual
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:13.020]   drop shipping.
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:18.660]   He farms out order fulfillment by hiring digital workers on the platform upwork for $3, $4,
[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:21.260]   and $5 an hour.
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:25.460]   Madrigal says that when I searched the platform last week, there were 275 open jobs for drop
[02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:26.460]   shipping shipping.
[02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:31.700]   200 of Freli express specifically, 132 for Oberlo.
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:33.100]   And there's all sorts of other things.
[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:35.380]   There's little timers that will say, "Oh, we're almost running out.
[02:11:35.380 --> 02:11:38.900]   You better order right now," even though that's not true.
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:39.900]   I mean, just on and on.
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:43.500]   And the kid doesn't own any inventory, doesn't have to have any inventory, doesn't even
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:46.420]   have to have any money up front.
[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:49.100]   Basically this is, he just creates this entity.
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:54.220]   It's like Cafe Press only bigger and worse.
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:56.220]   Yeah.
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:57.580]   Really fascinating article.
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:00.580]   And I think a cautionary tale, that's why I want people to read it.
[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:06.340]   The strange brands in your Instagram feed, because, well, yeah, some of these are fine.
[02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:07.340]   I noticed this.
[02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:08.980]   Like all of a sudden, maybe it's me.
[02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:11.260]   I'm starting to see a lot of, remember it was like those ads for wallets.
[02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:14.540]   I'm starting to see a lot of ads for wall clocks.
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:20.900]   And I bet you they're cheaply made, they glue a Xerox of the face because it looks really
[02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:22.740]   cool and it's brightling and stuff.
[02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:24.060]   And I'm sure they're, I bet you.
[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:25.060]   I don't know.
[02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:26.060]   I'm just saying.
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:30.180]   So why don't you create the Toots, the unicorn fund?
[02:12:30.180 --> 02:12:34.260]   I could expose this sort of thing.
[02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:35.460]   I could.
[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:39.420]   Anyway, that's my thing of the week.
[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:40.820]   That's our show for the week.
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:42.380]   And I thank you all for joining us.
[02:12:42.380 --> 02:12:45.300]   And I apologize if you're a Trump photo.
[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:47.020]   I just apologize.
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:52.220]   And if you're still here, I don't, I'm, I don't know what to say.
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:53.220]   Thank you.
[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:55.700]   Blame Jeff Jarvis.
[02:12:55.700 --> 02:13:00.700]   Pinko that he is, he's a Pinko and pink professor.
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:03.700]   Well, now you know, he's an intellectual and he's coasting.
[02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:04.700]   That does that.
[02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:08.020]   At the city university of New York, he's probably Jewish.
[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:12.620]   He's at buzz machine.com, author of what would Google do?
[02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:15.380]   Public parts, all about privacy.
[02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:17.140]   Gutenberg, the geek and geek sparing gifts.
[02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:18.140]   All about news.
[02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:19.140]   He's great.
[02:13:19.140 --> 02:13:20.140]   We love Jeff.
[02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:22.380]   And I thank you so much for being here, Jeff.
[02:13:22.380 --> 02:13:25.380]   You're a cuck to the core.
[02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:32.700]   Stacey Higg and Batham, what more can I say, but you're like an old girlfriend.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:34.700]   You know, you just keep.
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:36.180]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:37.180]   I'm sorry.
[02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:38.180]   I'm sorry.
[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:40.180]   Stacey on IOT.
[02:13:40.180 --> 02:13:42.700]   Where is my punching bag?
[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:44.740]   We need one to come from both sides now.
[02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:47.540]   I'm just, I'm just trying to set that up.
[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:50.460]   Stacey on IOT is her IOT podcast with Kevin Tofol.
[02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:51.860]   Must listen.
[02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:53.780]   If you're interested in IOT, there's no better.
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:56.900]   And of course, her newsletter is also at Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:58.820]   She's gigastacey on the Twitter.
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:02.140]   Oh, I should have had us talk about a story.
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:03.140]   What story?
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:04.140]   What?
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:05.140]   What?
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:09.900]   No, I had this like cool moment at CES where I changed the way I thought about broadband
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:14.620]   access, which was like super amazing for me because I think a lot about broadband.
[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:17.140]   So that's why I was like, oh, I should have put that on the rundown.
[02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:18.140]   Next week.
[02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:19.580]   Can you do it next week?
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:20.900]   It is totally not timely.
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:21.900]   It's just really interesting.
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:27.780]   Tune in next week for Stacey's Epiphany on most of these same stations.
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:28.780]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:29.780]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:34.140]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, right after Windows week.
[02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:37.260]   It's about 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:39.920]   You could tune in live, in fact, watch it at Twit.
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:45.740]   But before we cut out all the anti-trub stuff, Twit.tv/live, it wasn't anti-trub.
[02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:47.340]   I'm just teasing you.
[02:14:47.340 --> 02:14:48.340]   You know I am.
[02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:50.340]   It was a joke story.
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:52.940]   It's just joking around.
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:53.940]   Yeah.
[02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:54.940]   Joking around.
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:55.940]   Your hair joke.
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:56.940]   You cuck you.
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:01.340]   It's the weirdest epithet, isn't it?
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:02.340]   It's just weird.
[02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:03.340]   Yeah.
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:07.020]   You zagat you.
[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:09.220]   You can watch it live, Twit.tv/live.
[02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:11.860]   You can be in the chatroom, check you should be in the chatroom if you're watching live,
[02:15:11.860 --> 02:15:13.420]   because that's a great community.
[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:15.540]   By the way, there you go.
[02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:20.540]   A community of people getting together from all over the world on the internet.
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:21.540]   True.
[02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:26.940]   Since 2000, I started doing that 2004, I think.
[02:15:26.940 --> 02:15:27.940]   That's when I...
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:29.140]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:33.900]   1994 on my radio show on KSOFO and then on KGO.
[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:34.900]   You know who was...
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:35.900]   I said this before.
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:38.140]   The first moderator was Robert Scobel.
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:40.140]   Where is he now?
[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:45.420]   Anyway, thanks to our great many, many, many great moderators who...
[02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:46.420]   You want to know?
[02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:47.420]   No.
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:51.060]   Who take good care of our chatroom and make it...
[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:54.260]   As you said, with curation comes greatness.
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.820]   A great place to be IRC, always a happy place to be.
[02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:59.660]   I come in in the middle of the night, they don't know it and I watch.
[02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:02.020]   Scooter X, your moderator for this show, will sleep?
[02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:03.180]   One of many moderators.
[02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:06.020]   There are probably half dozen in there right now.
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:07.220]   Scooter's very active.
[02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:08.220]   We love Scooter.
[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:09.220]   Thank you, moderator.
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:10.220]   It's a great guy.
[02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:11.220]   Thank you, mods.
[02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:12.220]   And Oz, Ned.
[02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:13.220]   I don't know if it's a gear sheet, but...
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:14.220]   We don't know.
[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:15.220]   That's part of it.
[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:16.780]   We don't know anything about them.
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:19.860]   We do know there are both men and women moderators.
[02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:22.660]   That's all we know.
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:24.620]   I know a little bit more.
[02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:25.620]   I don't...
[02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:28.100]   It's like, wow, that's a lot of mystery to those of around.
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:29.100]   I'll never tell.
[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:34.700]   Well, I want them to be anonymous because they sometimes are battling the trolls and
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:40.660]   I don't want them to anyway get in trouble.
[02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:41.660]   But they do a great job.
[02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:42.660]   IRC.
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:43.660]   We didn't even say where.
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:44.660]   IRC.tuit.tv.
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:50.140]   You can do that in a browser, but if you have an internet relay chat client, IRC chat client,
[02:16:50.140 --> 02:16:51.380]   it's the best way to do that.
[02:16:51.380 --> 02:16:54.420]   And I keep one open all the time on my desktop at home because it's just great.
[02:16:54.420 --> 02:16:56.820]   There's always somebody in there.
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:57.820]   Let's see what else.
[02:16:57.820 --> 02:16:59.260]   Oh, you don't have to watch live, by the way.
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:01.660]   You can get on to man versions of the show.
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:04.260]   The website is twit.tv/twig.
[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:06.660]   T-W-I-T.tv/twig.
[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:08.380]   You can also subscribe.
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:11.940]   Find your favorite podcast and subscribe to Twig.
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:14.820]   Now when you'll get it, the minute it's done, every week.
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:16.460]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:19.220]   And we will see you next time on This Week at Google.
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:19.460]   Bye bye.
