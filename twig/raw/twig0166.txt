[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Gita Tripani is back.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.000]   We've got baby pictures.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   We'll also talk about the maps,
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.000]   Snafu, more Google killings,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.500]   you know, of products, people.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.000]   And Mike Elgin joins us from Greece
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   to tell us how best to use Google Plus.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   It's all next on Twig.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   we're so glad to get her back
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   for mommy duties, Gina Trapani,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   smartaward.org.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Think up app, I'll talk quietly.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   (laughing)
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   - Baby's asleep. - Little eta is sleeping.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   - Eta is sleeping.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   - Hopefully I don't look too sleep-derived
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and that my baby brain won't affect the show too much.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   - You look great. - Can't apologize if I say something completely.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   (laughing)
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   - Jennifer always said that having children
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   reduces your IQ bit by bit.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   You transfer the brain brains over to the baby.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   - When she was in the hospital, I would park the car
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and I would go see her and then I'd go down
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and I would just wander through the working lot
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   because I couldn't remember where I parked the car.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's a sleep deprivation. - Yeah, for something.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   - It's a biological fact.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   (laughing)
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Anyway, we're so happy for you.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Congratulations.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   - Thank you so much.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   - And we were so glad you could join us.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   - Yeah, me too.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It's great to be kind of back at it a little bit,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   although I hope that no one's going to criticize
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   my maternity leave the way they've been talking
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   about Marissa Meyer's maternity leave.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   - Oh my.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Well, we'll get right on that one in a second,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   but first let me introduce our rest of our panel.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Of course, Jeff Jarvis is also here from buzzmachine.com,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   the author of what we Google do in public parts.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   - Silently. - You're right.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   - Oh, we had you muted.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   - What?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   - Are you ever-- - I'm just--
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   - Am I here?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   - Yeah, we're got you now.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   - I was--
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You're not the first to want to mute me in life,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I'll tell you that.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   (laughing)
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   - It'd be nice to have a mute button in general.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   - I'm just impressed that Gina took the towel
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   remember to take the towel off the roller.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   - Yes, the spit towel.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   (laughing)
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Spit up towel.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   - I'm still learning to get that towel off on there first.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   - Oh, I'll tell you.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's good to just get cloth diapers for a week
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   so that you have something,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   because they make the best-- never mind.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   We should really stop this now.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   (laughing)
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Gina, you're with three old dads.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   'Cause all three of us have grown kids.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   So anything you want to know, we vaguely remember.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   - I need a lot of help.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   (laughing)
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   - And here's a man who's changed his share of diapers,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   ladies and gentlemen, from Sparta, Greece.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Mike Elgin, hey, Mike?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   - Hey, thank you for having me on.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   - It looks like you're in the storage cupboard.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   - Yeah, I'm in a--
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   We have a little studio here.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   - Oh, nice.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   - And it's quite nice and tiny.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It has a balcony with grape vines all over the place.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It's very Mediterranean-viewed place.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   But yeah, it's really, really nice.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   We're right downtown.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   - So jealous.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   - Somebody said this--
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   - I'm even jealous of myself.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   - The show is now three and a half dads.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   (laughing)
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   - It's a good name for it.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   (laughing)
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   - I can't tell you on how many forms I crossed out the word
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   "Father" and put "Mother" on in the past week.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   - Yeah.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   - So I'm happy to identify.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   - Right on.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Right on, right on, right on.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So let's see what's going on in the world around us.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Why don't we start with Marissa Meyer, since that's a topic near
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and dear to all of our hearts, the CEO, a new CEO of Yahoo.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   - Well, the cover of Fortune.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   - On the cover of Fortune, the world's 50 most powerful women.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   She doesn't look pregnant there.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   - No.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   - No.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   - No.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   - When is she due?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   - She had her baby boy on Monday, I think.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   - Wow, so she went from zero to 60.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   (laughing)
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   - I heard she's crowdsourcing the name of the baby.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   - Well, that may have been my fault, actually.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I got an email, but it was obviously a gang email.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   - That's what I saw.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   - One imagines thousands of people
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and saying that we didn't have a name yet as suggestions.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Welcome.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So I tweeted, boy, she's crowdsourcing the name of the baby.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   That got picked up all over.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I hope I didn't offend her.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   - No, I love that.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   - That was kind of great.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   - I don't know if they've come up with a name.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   A baby boy, Meyer, was born Sunday night.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And of course, the controversy immediately, she intends to return
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   to the workplace as soon as possible, likely in one or two weeks.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   - Strong lady.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   - But you know what?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   She said she was going to do that all along, right?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   - And--
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   - Yeah, she'd be clear about that from the beginning.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   - Yep.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   - And certainly, I don't know if her husband's staying home or what.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I mean, I don't think it's anybody's business what their arrangement is.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But I think you as a new parent understand why it would be nice to stay home
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   for as long as possible.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   - Yeah, I mean, listen, her kit, she's going to have lots of care.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   She's going to have an army of folks taking care of helping her out.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And taking care of her and taking care of her kid.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And she's got her husband.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I just-- you know, obviously, this is a-- it's too close to my heart right now.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And it's just interesting to me.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I mean, there just aren't that many dads, you know, who-- new CEOs who were men
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   who would, you know, have full articles written about how she, you know,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   is doing a disservice to her baby boy by not staying home.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   - I think there is the issue, though, that she should probably be very clear.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   This is my choice, this is what I'm doing.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   This does not mean that this is recommended or expected behavior of other Yahoo employees.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I'm sure they have a much more generous paternity leave policy than that.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   - I mean, yeah, there's that question of the role model question, right?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's like a kind of example.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Is she setting?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I think that the reality is that she has a lot more money than most people in the world
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   and that she's going to be-- her son is not going to be neglected.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   - And for all we know, she has a playpen and a crib in her office.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I mean, we don't know what this is.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   - Well, that is one rumor that there's an office next door that will be devoted to the kid community,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   which I think could be a wonderful thing.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   - Let's do it that way.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   What's wrong with that?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   - I think it'd be a great thing to have big care.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I mean, this doesn't sound horrible and flip, but I don't mean it this way.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   But I was in the office as a boxy yesterday.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   There are two really cute dogs walking around, you know, you can have kids around the office, too.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   There's no harm in it.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   - Well, the thing is that they didn't hire her for her to use her hands.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   - Yes.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   - Or I think she's using her mind.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   - She's not assembling iPhones.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   - She's not assembling iPhones.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   - Good point.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   - As Bush used to say.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   She's still got her brains at her command.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   She's an executive.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   She's not, you know, she had like, for example, I don't think I could do it because I have
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   to type to do my job, but she doesn't.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   She has meetings and she issues edicts, presumably, and you can do that while you're holding a baby.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I think it's awesome.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   - She should have a baby be worn on and just go, "You do this.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Do that."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   - No.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   - That's all she...
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   - Anyway, I think it seems a little sexist to make a big deal out of this.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   The only concern would be that there's some sort of unstated expectation now.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Yeah, well, Marissa took two weeks, but what do you do in take?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   - No, I don't think they did that.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   - I don't think they did that.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   - I just appreciate it in California.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   - Not.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   - Yeah.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   - I'm ever amazed.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I talked to people, Tim Armstrong talked at an ad week event in New York yesterday and people
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   talking about Marissa, as her plan says, when I was visiting Google, I asked about Marissa,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   when other people asked for Marissa, the respect she has across our industry is really, really
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   impressive.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   We've talked about this on the show a lot about how just her going to Yahoo! gave Yahoo!
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Hope.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   That lives.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   People are saying that she's done all the right things so far in terms of internal culture.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   So much clearer what her strategy is, but I think that she keeps the goodwill of the industry
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   still.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Now she has a cute little big boy without a name.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   - Yeah.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   - Mark to the point.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Go ahead.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   - Command's respect because she works hard.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   - Yeah.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   - Right?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   - Yes.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   - And that's, I think that's part of this.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   When my girl was born, I was like, "Oh, where am I going to post pictures?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I don't want to be that parent that floods Facebook."
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   - Why the hell not?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Flood it, flood it, flood it.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Well, I really was like, "I want to use a photo sharing app and I don't really want to do
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Instagram."
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   - So what did you decide?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   - I went back to Flickr.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   - Interesting.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   - Yeah, I talked to my friends and they were like, "Flickers for kids."
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And, you know, Flickr's really great.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   They really had that kind of early Google circles concept.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   There's contacts, friends and family.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   So most of my baby pictures are marked as family only.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I have a couple of public ones up.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And, you know, there's not a lot of people there, but, you know, as a friend of mine said,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   you know, family will seek out cute pictures of the baby like truffle pigs.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   I was like, "Am I going to make my family set up Flickr accounts?"
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   It's like, they'll do it.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   - Did you set up an editor pan or whatever website.com?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   - Yeah, I did register her domain name.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   She has my wife's last name.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Yeah, so I have her domain name and I have a Twitter handle that I have not started tweeting
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   as her.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   - She has a Twitter handle.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   - She does.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   But I haven't started tweeting as her because I haven't decided whether or not I think that's
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   weird.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I'm kind of on the fence about it.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   - No, you should tweet.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Well, let me think.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   You know what I love?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   - I love the email ad where they created a Gmail account for the baby and then mailed,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   you know, Mom's and Dad wrote letters to the baby sent pictures.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   - Yeah, that is a really--
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   - When I saw that ad, it made me sad that we didn't have Gmail when Henry and Abby were
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   born.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I thought that would have been neat.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   - Yeah.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   - I think Eddish would be the youngest verified Twitter account ever.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   - Make it so, Dick Costolo.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   We're talking to you here.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   - I have to call it a favor because I had to get an underscore in her name.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I wasn't thrilled.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   I have to call it a favor for the username and then the verified checkbox.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   - How about Miss Edda?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   - Miss Edda.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   There's a lot of Eddas on Twitter.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I thought it was a unique name.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   It really is not.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   - It's a beautiful name.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I love that name.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   - Thank you.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   - Edda Rebecca.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   - Edda Rebecca Bailey.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   - Oh, oh.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   - Oh.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   - Oh.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   - Oh.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Oh.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   - Oh.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   - Oh.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.800]   - That's a great--for those who are listening.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   We are now observing pictures of Edderebago.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   - We're now looking at pictures of my daughter.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   I probably shouldn't do this to listeners for too long.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   - Oh, no.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   She is.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   Before she came home, she was in the hospital.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   Oh, she's the best.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   - That's my favorite one.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   - I know exactly what she's saying right there.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   I can read baby.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   - What she's saying?
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   - Feed me.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.800]   - She's saying Google dropped Google Maps from iOS.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   - What the?
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   - Wow, she's wired.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   Where are my Google Maps?
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   - Exactly.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   - I love it.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   Oh, is that a cute little munchkin?
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   So, okay, we're going to stop talking babies.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   I want to see Marissa's baby on Flickr.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   That's all.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   - I think if Marissa's committed, she would post pictures on Flickr of baby Marissa.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   We don't know the name yet.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.800]   She doesn't either, according to the last account.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   - Did you have Edda, but don't you usually have the name before the baby's born?
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   - Oh.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   - We had a working title.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   - Working title.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   - Working title.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   - Yeah.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   - I like that.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   Working title Jarvis.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   - My parents were frightened that we were actually going to name Jake Axel.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   - Axel Jarvis.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   I like it.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   - We had a top two.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   We had two finalists and decided we wanted to look at her before we decided.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   - I was kind of hoping you'd name her Betty after Betty and Mad Men, but okay.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   - Aww.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   - Betty Bailey.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   That's a good name.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   - You got to think for that Betty.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   - I do.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   - And you're January Jones.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   January is a kind of cool name.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   - I saw a picture of January Jones.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   She, I guess she lost a lot of that weight because she looked fantastic.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   She looked good.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   - I thought that was a fat suit.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   - I think it was a fat suit.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   But how did the fat face?
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   Was that a...
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   - No, that's a good question.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   - She was she had a baby.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   I mean, she had baby, you know.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   - Oh, that's right.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   She was pregnant.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   - Yeah.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   - Again with the babies.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   Okay, changing the subject is something much more...
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   - This is now this week in Googoo Dada.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   - Googoo Dada.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   (laughter)
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   - Well, maybe that's the name of the show.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   - Well, I did.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   - Mitt Romney preparing for the debates tonight went to Chipotle for lunch.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   (laughter)
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   And who is this guy on the left there, on his right?
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   His left.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   Some, some, some, some, in proper reporter went and talked to him and he says, "This is the face he does all the time."
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   - This is a new internet, "Meem in the making."
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   - Really?
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   - "Meem in the making."
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   (laughter)
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   - Oh, you're right.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   (laughter)
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   - Awesome profile picture.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   (laughter)
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   - Anyway...
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   (laughter)
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   - I actually, I've, I'm hesitant to mention the C word because the May 11th, 20, or something like that.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   - I think we were going to go, uh, episode of Twig was recently yesterday pulled from Google, from YouTube,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   because we played a Chipotle ad.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   - Oh, you're effing me.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   (laughter)
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   - A year ago?
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   - They, they just noticed.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   (laughter)
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.800]   - We got...
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   - The ad?
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   - Yeah.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   Remember when we played, I, you know, I actually had to get our staff.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   I think Tony Wang went through it to look at it to, I said, "Is there really a Chipotle copyright violation?"
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.800]   And he went through it, and sure enough...
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   - I'm tweeting this right now.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   Dear Chipotle tweets...
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   - Let me give you the, uh, the episode number.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   I have to launch my mail and get the company.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   - Do you know what it was?
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800]   Was it two...
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   What was it?
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   Was it?
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   - I love it when Jeff Trolls, Chipotle tweets, which is their...
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   - It was just full, or giving you free...
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   - We f***ing had back.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   Remember where they were going through the past, pastures and all that stuff?
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   - Oh yeah, though, that they were saying that the, that they humanely treat their own...
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   - Yeah, it was a good ad, and we, it was a, it was a news story, so it was fair use, you know, news coverage.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   B, it was a freaking ad for Chipotle, and they didn't, by the way, it wasn't just like a ding or anything.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   They yanked the video from YouTube, they had it taken down, and we got dinged on our, you know, copyright violation.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   - Uh, uh...
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   - All right, it's tweeted.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   - Retweet.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   - Tweet army.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   - Retweet that.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   - Yeah.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   - We're gonna start talking about Rubio's.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   - Did you hear that Mitt Romney went to Rubio's for lunch before the debate?
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   Or somewhere like it?
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.800]   - That health mix burritos really good.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   All right, so...
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   - Oh, we could really get him.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   I just, this is, you know, I only raise it as an example of the stupidity of the DMCA takedowns.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   - There was another stupid one, and then run out, run out wasn't there?
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   - Oh, they're constant.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   - There was another one on the run down today, but I had his own book.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   - Hey?
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   - No, it's his own, he got pulled from, what, Google?
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   - Because he had a bit torrent of his own book.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   - Oh yeah.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   Oh yeah, Google de-ranked him, and no, not de-ranked him, but they said you can't have AdSense on your page
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   because you have links on your page to the torrents at Pirate Bay and other places of your own book.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   And of course, it's an automatic thing, they see, you know, the Pirate Bay dot com,
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   and they pull you, the AdSense off, so he interacted with him, took down the links.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   I think maybe he says, he mentions you could find it on the Pirate Bay, still they won't pull it down.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   And it's part of the problem is this is this automated system.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   - Yeah, the thing is, he did everything right.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   - Right.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   - You know, he did what they had.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   - They still pulled it, they still pulled it, but you know what, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   it's a competitive marketplace for customers.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   He just needs to go to another Ad Networker.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   That's all there is to it.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   If they want to have people using their Ad Network, then they need to not do this kind of stuff.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   - Wouldn't that be the way to handle it?
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   That actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   And it's bad press for them because a lot of people are talking about it like us, for example, right now.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.800]   - Right.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   So I get, I mean, look at these YouTube information about your video all about Android.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   You may have content that is owned or licensed by TV, Rainru.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   Information about frame rate.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   You may have content that is owned or licensed by press association.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   But most of the times they say it's still available, this claim is not penalizing TNT334 content owned or licensed by Futura Networks.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   But then, so notice most of the time I just ignore it and go, "Okay, fine."
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   This week in Google, one, one, two, losers like us may have content that is owned or licensed by PCT.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   - Oh, that was a good episode. - Oh, that was a good episode, too.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   [laughter]
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   But I got three of them, PCTV.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.800]   All at once is like they all of a sudden looked at that video.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   Dow Jones, PCTV, neither of them pulled the site down or penalized us, but Chipotle did.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   My argument remains that, and I, you know, as Gina says, I'm sympathetic to the scale of the problem that Google and YouTube have here.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   And the other issues that come upon them, they got to set up, I think, juries of human peers.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   Well, there's also, and I think there's also fraud going on, because look at this.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   So here's the takedown.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   This contains content from Chipotle, Dow Jones, PCTV, and TV Bandarantes of Brazil.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   I guarantee you, I guarantee you, there's nothing owned by TV Bandarantes in Brazil.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   - They all, they all, your shirt. - They came from a part of the whole.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   So, what's happening? I believe, I would love to get some confirmation on this,
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   but I think that people are gaming this system because they don't want to take it down.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   See, TV Bandarantes, what they probably wanted was, fine, we'll run some ads on it and we'll share in the revenue from this.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   And I would suspect that that's what's going on, is that if I were a company,
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   I would, this would be an interesting way to try to make money.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.800]   Let's just assert copyright violation, not a ding.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   Just say, can we run some ads on there? Because that's one of the options.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   You get some options. You don't have to insist on a takedown.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   Chipotle took it down, which is probably pissing off TV Bandarantes,
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   because they don't get their ads now. Anyway, it's still down.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   We appealed it and it's still down, so I don't know what the status is.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   It just seems like this is Google's weak spot. This idea of like they're not being recourse
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:45.800]   or no human review or lack of customer service, we hear these stories about adsense accounts getting shut down
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   or somebody's Gmail account unreachable and Google just being unreachable and it's just being difficult to have a plead,
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   a case in any situation, either a copyright claim or just in general,
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   Google's customer service has not been, very purposefully it's not been something that they do.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   Right? I mean, they can.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   It's another story, Gina. Well, okay, go first, Leo.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   Is it practical? I mean, how many videos are uploaded every second to YouTube?
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   Right. I don't know. It's a good question. I don't know what it is,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   but Google deals in problems of scale. But from the very beginning, I think Stephen Levy wrote about this
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   and in the plaques, right? Like the founders of Google, you know, they would get email from people complaining about search results
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   and he said, don't write people back. Don't waste our time, you know, emailing users back.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   So, we're just fixing the problem algorithmically on our side. You know, let's just gather the data,
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   do our magic and fix it like that. But that leaves a lot of people think of the lurch
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   when you're, especially when you're publishing content or using services like an ad network.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   Well, that's the thing. It might be one thing for search. I can understand that for search.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   You know, people complain about search results. Hey, look, it's algorithmic.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   This is search results. We're reflecting the web. We don't have to respond to that.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   But pulling down a YouTube video because of inaccurate content takedowns.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   Accessations. It's almost, it's almost libelous to you that you would steal stuff. Right.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   And the, the, you know, you're right. There reflux is always the algorithmic solution.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   And I think what Leo said earlier is that this needs a human solution.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   Mm-hmm. Raises the question of scale. But I do think it's an opportunity that you have some, right?
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   If somebody goes to, like the story, the BitTorrent guy, he's gone through three layers now, clearly a human being.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   At some point, he deserves to have a human being to deal with.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   I can. And there needs to be a way to do that.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   And I still think this idea of juries appears that you take all of your advertisers
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   and the advertisers who don't want to find Google messed up.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   And, you know, you crowdsource with human beings this job of trying to verify that something just doesn't smell right,
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   which on its face it doesn't. We put up an ad. It's a commercial. You want it spread around.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   Well, the other thing is, the other thing is that I think they would save themselves a lot of trouble
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   if they would sort of have kind of verified sources. So, Twit is a known quantity.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   There's a lot of media that's discussed. And you could go over a history very quickly and determine that this sort of, you know,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   this sort of thing exists on coming from this new source, from this video source.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   And so sort of favor that source and assume that that source is doing something unless somebody makes a really strong case.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   You could go through and actually verify thousands of video sources and basically say, "Okay, these are okay.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   These are legitimate operations that are, you know, covering media that are likely to come up with false positives
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   that we treat them like everybody else." And then you can focus on the random videos coming from miscellaneous uploaders.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   I suspect they're doing that and we're just not big enough. I mean, I bet you ABC and NBC and CBS don't have this problem.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   Well, I'll bet you that there is a whitelist. Yeah.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   And you notice that they don't want to admit to a whitelist because the whitelist is anti-algorithmic.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   How's that for a new structure of philosophy? Oh, that's just not algorithmic. But they have to.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   They have huge clients and you're right, Leo. Then you're not big enough to be a huge client to just put on the way of the do not bother list.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   Right. Well, if Leo is not big enough, then it's problematic. The whitelist is just aint working.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   I mean, if they had the concept of verified accounts on Google+, it doesn't seem like, you know, adding a concept.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   Well, big enough, I think, Gina, in this case means big enough checks that go back and forth.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   That's exactly right. Big enough to want to do a business deal. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   Yeah. Well, it's frustrating for me. Fortunately, it's a year old show. If it had it been last week's show, it would be a costly care.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   Quit nation to add Chipotle tweets. Come on. Come on. You might as well go after TV, Bandarias in Brazil, while you're.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   That's true. No, no, I'm still bitter that Chipotle is not bought a friggin ad on twig for all the free publicity.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:01.800]   Well, that's the funny thing. Why did they pull it? Because we played a Chipotle ad on twit. That's why they pulled it.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   You were eating Chipotle on the air at one point. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   All right. Anyway, just it's just the welcome to welcome to the wild world of the web. The world wild web.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   This I'd be so upset. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a ticket. Moving along.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   Now that I've taken care of my personal issues. And mine. And genius.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   We've got to. Gee, I haven't had a haircut. I haven't skipped a haircut for this long since the 60s. What do you think?
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   I like it. Oh, it's interesting. Now, did you wash your hair last night or did you? Or not? Hey, did you condition it?
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   No. It looks a little tufty. It is. I just, it's just long, but I'm just trying to go through my personal issues.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:25:01.800]   Taking my Gerturn. I don't have any. I don't know. You're smart enough. I've smart a drinking olive oil by the gallon.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   Ooh, yum, yum, yum.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   Good life. I'll never forget Dean Ornish coming on my radio show, plopping down a bottle of olive oil.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   Say, "Would you drink that? Then why are you putting it in your food?"
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   I think he's backed off on that a little bit now. Let us move along and talk a little bit about maps, but not a lot, just briefly.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   Maps are not in iOS 6. They're not on the iPhone 5. And Apple had to apologize for that. And even, this must have really made some people at Google's day suggest.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   Maybe you should use Bing or Google Maps for the time being, "We're sorry, we screwed up." Wow.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   Yeah. Well, points to Mr. Cook and Apple for just being upfront and somewhat humble, but yeah, that whole, "Hey, like, visit their website and then add a link to it on your home screen." Yikes.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:10.800]   Farhad Manju makes a really interesting point in Pandut, Pando Daily. He says, "Actually, since Tim Cook's apology, this map's debacle has turned into a win for Apple."
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   I think that was the most fan boyish logic I have ever seen in my life. Try to justify absolutely everything that Apple does as a brilliant move.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   Brilliant move! Jesus.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   He says, "The headline is, "Mapgate is over. Apple won. Customers won. Google, not so much." His point with Google is true, though, that Google must have known, certainly we've all known since June, and really we had a pretty good idea even long before then that Apple was planning its own mapping app.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:53.800]   They were buying mapping companies. They even said a year ago when they had a privacy issue with data being stored on the iPhone, they said, "Well, we're collecting this data for a future app that will include traffic information."
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   They really have not made this a secret. Google certainly knew why didn't they have an app ready because every day that goes by without a Google Maps app is money down the tube.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:18.800]   Yes, and no. I honestly come to think that Google is better off for at least a little while, if it's not in there, because people are now saying Apple's not perfect, that they do prefer Google Apps.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   Where do you get Google Apps?
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   Android. Yeah, okay. But he says, and he quotes Horace Dediyu, who's pretty good on this stuff, "The company has admitted it makes more in ads on the iPhone than it does on Android devices. Horace estimated Google makes about six bucks a year on every iPhone compared to two bucks for every Android phone."
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   How do you approach that search? That's probably a lot of that is search. They don't charge the apps.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   And as somebody else said today, I think it might have been you, but I don't know who was, said that, "Oh, I don't, search engine watch."
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   Danny, who said that probably now, if there was any thought of pulling Google search off the iPhone, that's not true. They dare not now.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   Yeah, yeah, because it would hurt them.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   And I wonder why Apple didn't slam back up the Google app that existed.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:24.800]   Because it's an Apple app, and it's not. Now, the other side of the story, I think we talked about this last week, was according to some sources, Google was the one that killed the maps because Apple said, "Well, we don't have parity with Android. You need to give us turn."
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   That would have been a big turn.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   That would have been a big turn. It sure depends on Apple's, but there was still another year on the contract.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   Right.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   So Apple pulled it because they weren't getting what they wanted, which was turned by turn directions in the future.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   Well, I don't like it.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.800]   Well, I don't like it.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   I tell you.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   Why? But why wouldn't Google have a maps app ready? I understand the shot in Freud, but this is business. Let's just be good business people.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   There's a ton of data Google is no longer getting from Apple that is valuable. There's a real tangible value.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   I go back to what I said, which is that I was drawn to this device by the services, not the hardware.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   Right.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   And so the more addicted I am to Google services, the more I become addicted to the Google lifestyle.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   So the point that when I stopped and best buy today, I stopped by the guy. The poor very lonely guy who stands there a day in a day trying to pitch Chromebooks.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   And what a lonely job.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   The main topic.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   Wow.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   And a mis guy.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   Who did he piss off at Google?
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   Oh, geez.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   He's wearing a Google shirt and best buy. He's the coolest guy at Best Buy, but.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   And I started talking to him and I'm honest to God thinking about a Chromebook because I'm just so into the Google services now and I just use them all.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   So I don't know. I could sound like the Google version of Farhan if I go too far on this, arguing this with Google's brilliant move.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   But all I'm actually trying to say is that I think that there is a silver lining for this in Google more than for Apple.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   But the theory that Google is withholding and deliberately sort of foregoing revenue and visibility on iOS is inconsistent with what it's done historically with a gazillion other things.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   I mean, a lot of things have actually come out. A lot of Google things have come out on iOS before the Android version.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   And for the most part with the exception of this turn by turn directions thing on maps, which I don't really know the details about that.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   But for the most part, it's always been kind of shockingly and refreshingly conspicuous that Google has tried to get everything on both devices.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   I think it was even the Google Plus app came out first on iOS.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   Right. And then it came out on Android weeks later.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.800]   So it just doesn't feel right that they would do that. It's inconsistent with everything else they've done.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   I use the iPhone and an Android phone. And I've just come to accept that the maps experience on the iPhone is inferior because I was just used to turn by turn on Android.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   I mean, I think that that's Google sort of making it's like, you know, maps is better on Android.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   I think that they're really making that point with this.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   But it was interesting. I spent a lot of time in the hospital this past week taking care of my daughter.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   And I was overhearing the nurses talking about the new iPhone. And obviously people didn't work in technology.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   And it was fascinating because they're like, oh, Dr. So-and-so got the new iPhone 5.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   Did you see it? Oh, it's bigger and faster. And then one of them said, yeah, but I heard Google's not on it.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   What am I going to do without Google on my phone? I can't be without Google on my phone.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   This was like word for word. And I was really surprised that it was they were conflating maps and Google search.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   She was saying, how am I going to get anywhere? It's always interesting to hear normal people talk.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   Oh, fascinating. I could have put it. They were really excited about the iPhone 5. Like, really excited about it.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   You know, just like, oh, it's new. You see it. And, you know, so, you know, this apparently this doctor always has the new toys.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   So they was like, oh, has she been through yet? We want to see it. So excitement. But also just this, you know, I heard Google's not on it.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   What does that mean? So, you know, I think I don't think that Google has a universal policy about which platform they're released for first.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   I think Google's a huge company with lots of different teams. And I think that they just, you know, that those teams make decisions about which platform are launched first on kind of independently.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   Also, there's Apple's approval process, which we know can be really protracted, you know, for Google products.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   So they might work on the iOS app, you know, sooner in some cases and later in others.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   Though I have to say, I agree, they should have had a Google Maps app kind of in their back pocket, native app in their back pocket, Don already.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   And I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised if they do. And if that isn't, do they make a statement about this?
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   That it's not out for the next few months. Is that?
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   I haven't said anything. Eric Schmidt said some fairly opaque things. Like, well, it's Apple's decision. What can we do?
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   And we would like to be everywhere. And of course, Google has said you can always use the web page.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   It works. Just bookmark it under your homepage. In fact, that's what Tim Cook also said.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   I don't know. Google hasn't been pretty opaque about what its plans are.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   Yeah, it seems like in the meantime that the story is going to be, if you want a great Maps experience, you get an Android phone.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   And I wouldn't be surprised if that app showed up in the App Store in the next few weeks.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   Mike, why haven't they have the -- so what is our consensus? Are they writing one? Have they written one?
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   Are they writing one? Who knows what they're doing, but I think they've made a decision and they had some reason for that decision they haven't told us about.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   It could be that if they told us the decision, we'd go, that makes a lot of sense. It could be outraged. We don't know about that.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   But the larger issue that -- and actually these doctors and nurses you overheard actually kind of on to something because both Google and Apple and other companies are headed for this world where instead of having all these apps all over the place where you
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   individually go and search and browse and pan around on a map and get results on a search engine, you're going to talk to a Siri-like virtual assistant and all these cases, Google Now, Siri, other people are going to have these things.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   And they're just going to give you answers. So they're kind of all jockeying for position for this new world of having everything.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   They're still going to be using search and maps and all these other services. They're just going to be invisible behind the surface, just like they are on Siri.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   So, for example, Siri uses Google, but not the advertising for Google. And Siri uses all these other services that are actually replaceable.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   You can swap out -- if Apple wanted to, they could just toss out Google Search, throw in Bing, and you'd still be using Siri.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   And so, you know, there's a lot of this kind of jockeying for position for this new world of virtual assistant technology where all the answers are just handed to you.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:35:02.800]   And people want to own the part of it where they're harvesting personal information. They're harvesting the information about where you are and what you're buying and what you're doing and all this stuff because that's really where the money is in this new sort of context sensitive advertising.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   So, it's hard to parse out which part of this is jockeying for position and which part of it is the thermonuclear war against Google and which part of it is just how the chips are falling.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   According to Walt Mossberg today in allthingsd.com, Google will announce Thursday that it is adding Street View to the web version of Google Maps that you use on the iPhone and the iPad, which to me is Google saying, "Shoot, quick, fix the web app."
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   And then he says, "I tested this edition," which displays 360 degree photographic street views of select locations and interior photographic views of certain businesses, ours, using sample links, Google sent me.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   So, Google has gone to Walt Mossberg and said, "No, no, look, we're going to add this on Thursday." He says, "Cajalee, I also believe Google is working on a new Google Map app for the Apple platform that would be offered as an additional download."
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   My guess is somebody at Google said that, "By the way, the app is coming."
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   Yeah, that's what it sounds like.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   Yeah. He does this all in the context of his review of Google Maps on Android, in which he says is mature, powerful, he loved it.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   It's definitely the thing I miss the most with the iPhone, for sure.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   Yeah. Interesting. I don't use it that much. And even the Apple Maps where we are in the Bay Area are just fine.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   I mean, it's not, they're not inadequate, but in some areas I understand that they are.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   And I use other apps like Waze, which I love, which is on both Android and iPhone, and is a crowd sourced turn-by-turn direction system. That's great.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   So, I don't, I'm not sure I miss Google Maps that much.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   Yeah, I should really use Waze more. I never, I always want the turn-by-turn directions, and I just launch maps, and then I'm like, "Oh, I got to look at this map."
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   You know, I want to tell me the turn left.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   It's a good point because, of course, when you use Siri on the Google, on the iPhone, it immediately launches Apple's maps.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   Siri does not have a direct connect.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   So, it's occurring to me that it's kind of the duck duck go of maps, or perhaps duck duck go would be a good brand for the new Apple Maps.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   Did you see the New Yorker cover remake has done by Apple Maps?
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   Mad Magazine did it. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   Brilliant.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   I hope Mad puts that on the cover of their next issue. Let me see if I can find it.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   But you know, New Yorkers always done this. The New Yorkers always published, you know, the New Yorkers view of the country, and it's always New York, and then the rest of the countries were, you know, kind of over there.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   LA.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   LA.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   So,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   It's all the rundown.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.800]   Yeah, it's a slow, it's a, I'll try another link here.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   I'm frozen solid.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   I do think it's worth noting that the whole maps debacle did not go the way Apple planned it to go.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   Yes, that's weird.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   And it's been a horrible PR black eye and really a bad, it's really a bad thing now within, you know, just coming near the one year anniversary of Steve Jobs death that they seem to be stumbling and fumbling and making a lot of mistakes.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   They had some mistakes with some advertising that they did where they came out with these weird, you know, Apple genius ads that kind of hit with a thud.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   They pulled them and then denied that they pulled them because they were horrible.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   You know, there's a bunch of stuff like that. It just feels like, I mean, it doesn't feel like they're a disastrous company.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   They feel like an ordinary company lately, making these big blunders of the kind that maybe they did and maybe they didn't make before, but without the reality distortion field to make it all good.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   It's really, you know, they're looking like a normal company, but normal company that makes wonders.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   They make mistakes, but they always, you know, I could think of hundreds of Apple mistakes.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:56.800]   I don't anybody who thinks Apple doesn't make mistakes is not paying attention from the cube to ping.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   We have plenty of examples of Apple stumbling.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   So I...
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   The successes are so stellar though.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   Right.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   When they do it right, they do it right.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   And you know, those nurses aren't far wrong from a fashion point of view from, you know, that's...
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   And I think that's what sells the iPhone at this point.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   It's not technological excellence.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   It's beautiful.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   It's a...
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   Well, that isn't what Apple does. They do hardware.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   It's beautiful.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.800]   Whoops.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   Oh.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   Don't drop it.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   It was beautiful.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   [laughter]
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   Now it's scratch.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   It's too thin and light.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   It's way drop.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   Actually, the funny thing is, you know, everybody always raves about how good looking these are and then puts it in the kitchen.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   And then puts it in the case that makes it look like in 1950s appliance.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   I do...
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   My one iOS 6...
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   I haven't gotten the iPhone 5.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   I have the 4S and I just upgrade to iOS 6.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.800]   My one sort of gripe about it, and this is just because I've been taking tons of pictures of the baby,
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   so I keep getting this iCloud, you know, you're running out of storage, upgraded iCloud storage prompt.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   Like every single time I pick up my phone, like I'm trying to take a video of my newborn and I have like a manager set, you know,
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   manager storage settings prompt.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   So frustrating.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   That's why computers don't belong in TVs, toasters, or cameras.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   That's true.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   Because that's what computers do is they annoy you.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   They annoy you.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   I have a smart TV that kept asking me to log into Facebook.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   I'm watching TV.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   I don't want to log into Facebook.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   Right.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   It's just, I don't want to smart anything.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   No.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   Dom.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   My things to be dumb.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   I'm looking for a complete backlash and everybody's going to start using Western Electric.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   Here's the picture from The New Yorker.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   Now using Apple Maps and of course, it's all confused.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   They've got the Champs-Ely-Z going down the middle of Manhattan, then the Sea of Galilee, leading to the equator and Kuala Lumpur.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   And then the Mississippi River.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   In the middle right there.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   It's, yeah, this obviously is not this bad.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   But Turkey is next to Las Vegas and Brooklyn.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   I love it.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.800]   You know, as someone from Brooklyn, that's not too...
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.800]   That's good.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   And the Yukon territory is just between Brooklyn and Chad.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   I hope this doesn't affect the wonderful Mad Magazine iOS app for the iPad.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   Oh, fantastic.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   Oh.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   And by the way, here's an update from Gizmodo.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   Apparently, our engineering team just gave me this information.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   We recommend that you angle the camera away from... Oh, this is the purple...
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   This is the purple haze.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   Purple flare.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   You're holding it wrong.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   You're holding it wrong.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   Holy cow.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   Our engineering team just gave me this information.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   I recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source with taking pictures.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   As far as this...
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   We don't know how to fix that.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   We don't know how to fix that.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   I love it.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   Oh, Lord.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   Apple will never get over your holding it wrong.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   Never, ever, ever.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   All right, so enough of Farhad and the map... I think we've done enough of the mapping.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   Yep.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   We had to do it.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   Let's find a way out of this.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   I know, I can't.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   How about an ad?
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   An ad's always the best anchor for which to launch the next topic.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   And our ad today from squarespace.com, everything you need to make an exceptional website.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   The new Squarespace is here.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   Squarespace 6 was more than a year in the making because the folks at Squarespace decided to
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   do a total rewrite.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   Now, let me first say what Squarespace is.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   It's web hosting and the software on top of it.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   Tightly integrated.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   And that gives you a really much better experience.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   It's one of the reasons Squarespace sites never go down.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   They've got really great, fast, responsive, sophisticated algorithms to make sure the site
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   never goes down no matter how much traffic you get.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   But also, you don't have to worry about security because it's automatically patched.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   It's always up to date.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   It's Squarespace sites, to my knowledge, I don't know of any Squarespace site ever guiding
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.800]   one of those malware warnings.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.800]   We get that all the time, even on our site.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   It's really kind of amazing, exceptional stuff.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   When you use a new Squarespace 6, one of the features you're going to get is something that's
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   very hot right now in the web design world.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.800]   It's called responsive design.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   And it needs to be because it used to be you would have a mobile site distinct from your
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   regular site.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   This is for big screens.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.800]   This is for little screens.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   But now, so many people use your sites on mobile that really the best way is to adapt,
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   to have a site that looks great, same site on any size screen.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.800]   And that's what Squarespace is now doing.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   So when you upload an image, for instance, the Squarespace.com, you'll upload one image that
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   they make seven different versions out of, one a size for every different possible screen
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.800]   from the iPhone to a 27-inch monitor.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   When you design your site using the drag and drop, or even if you see CSS in JavaScript,
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   the design automatically reflows to fit the screen that you're on.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   It's just so elegant, so modern.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   By the way, they're templates, totally modern too.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   Take a look at those.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:29.800]   You can go to squarespace.com, take a tour, and if you'd like to try it free, you can.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   Just right on the front page there, the get started button.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.800]   That'll actually start you at the beginning with the templates.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.800]   You can select a template, you can change it.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   This is so cool.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   They've completely separated content from design, so that kind of like CSS Zen Garden does.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   So you create your design, start loading content.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:56.800]   And any time you just click a new design and boom, everything reflows into that design.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   I just think they've done such a good job.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.800]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   You don't need any personal information except your email address.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   And you're good to go if you decide to buy.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   There are two different plans.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   There's the basic plan and there's the unlimited plan.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   It starts at $8 a month when you buy a year.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:23.800]   But for $16 a month, you get unlimited pages, galleries and blogs, unlimited bandwidths, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:28.800]   They'll give you a custom domain name when you sign up for a year on any, on either plan.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   So if you want to have at a Rebecca Bailey dot com, they give it to you free and then they wire it up so that goes right to your Squarespace site.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   The form builder, Mailchipsink, complete integration of all the social networks, $16 a month.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   Now here's the deal.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   If you decide you want to do that, I would use the offer code TWIG10, TWIG10 for the 10th month because that'll give you 10% off whatever your first purchase is.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   So do the year long purchase so you get the most bang for your buck.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   I think Squarespace is fantastic and I know you're going to want to try it.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   And it's perfect if you have a newborn or some special event like a newlywed.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   You know, well, I'll give you an example.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   Ryan Block of Veronica Belmont just got married.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   And they initially, Ryan was telling me on Twitch, they went to like a site that does wedding, you know, provided as wedding sites.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   And it was terrible.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   So Veronica said, "What's this do it on Squarespace?"
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   So their Blockmont site was on Squarespace.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   And it's just the easiest thing in the world.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   And it's perfect for a one off occasion like that.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.800]   Squarespace.com.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.800]   You know, Leo, one of the things that is, I've become a Squarespace user recently.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   And it's amazing.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   It's like super amazing.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   One of the things that's least appreciated about it is the way support works.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   And all the web based stuff that I've used in the past, you click on support and it drops you off into this knowledge base.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   It kind of says, "Well, good luck.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   Maybe you can find it because you'll never find our phone number or email address."
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:06.800]   And they always try to make you go through this sort of crucible to get to the actual support.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   Even if you know that your question is not going to be in the knowledge base on Squarespace, you hit support and it says, "Just ask us a question."
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   And you just send them an email and they send you an answer.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   It's amazing.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   Great 24/7.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   Somebody, Squarespace, try it.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   Twig 10.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   Somebody just told me that Mitt Romney's doing a Google+ Hangout right now.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   Pre-debate or is that going to be later?
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.800]   Somebody mentioned that in the chat room.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   He's doing it from Chipotle, I think.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   That's actually one of the interesting things.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   I don't know if that's true or not, but one of the interesting things that's happening in this debate is while the debate is going on, other people are going to be, I don't want to say heckling, but making commentary live during the debate.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   One of them is Gary Johnson, who's the libertarian candidate, and sued the organization who's holding the debates for excluding him.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:07.800]   He feels that he should have been included in the debates and he was not.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   Instead of just being silent during the debates, he's actually going to be kind of like Mystery Science Theater.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.800]   He's going to be sitting there making comments throughout the entire debate.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   There's also a reason magazine, I think, is going to do that.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   There's kind of an interesting new world of debates where the whole point of a debate used to be that the candidates that were the anointed candidates of the two parties had monopoly on the nation's attention.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   But now that we have social media, and especially video social media like Google+ Hangouts, you're going to have other people throwing in their voices and having a critical eye at what's going on in real time.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   So it's going to be a really interesting election.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.800]   That turns the Democratic response upside down.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   Do it in real time.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:58.800]   So this is, in fact, if you follow Mitt Romney on Google+ right there at the top of his feed, debate night hangout.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   No, he's not in there right now.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   But Romney for American people are.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   And I wonder if he might stop by.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.800]   I mean, he's got some more important things to do.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   But this is-
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.800]   I also announced a bunch of Twitter handles.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   After the debates, you have the idiot structure of the spin room where you go and you listen to the two sides spin.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   What you've just heard is if you can't decide yourself, well, the spin room is now Twitter.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   So Romney's staff to also respond to what Michael's talking about will be putting out their spin on Twitter.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.800]   As obviously Obama's staff will, the same as we all- we citizens will be all saying the same.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   And we'll get drowned in spin.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   What Romney meant to say just there?
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.800]   It wasn't easy.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   [laughter]
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   There have been some great hashtags this week.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   Romney was supposedly off rehearsing zingers and trying to find zingers.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   So not Romney's zingers, but hashtag.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   A lot of speculative fingers.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:08.800]   Well, you know, on the one hand, I celebrate the fact that there are these unmediated channels for a candidate or a campaign to talk to voters.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   Because I think that's great.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   I mean, unmediated is fantastic.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   But on the other hand, there is an even better facility now for voters who don't want to hear the other side just to say,
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   "Well, I'm going to follow this hashtag." And then I'll only, you know, now I'm in my own spin room.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   Yeah, but the echo chamber argument, but I think what happens is you'll find people in that hashtag arguing with people in the opposing hashtag unless you have some sense of that opposing hashtag.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   Right.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   And, you know, I'm, of course, I'm following both candidates hoping to see germane tweets from them.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   Romney only has, I'm kind of surprised, 1.2 million followers on Twitter.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   What is President Obama has something like 10 million or something?
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   I think he's not worth it.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.800]   He is a lot.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   And a lot of them are fake.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   A lot of both candidates are fake.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   That's right.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.800]   I remember that.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   In fact, that's right.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   Wasn't that the case that they analyzed that Mitt had a huge jump on one day of something like 20,000?
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   And most of those people or a big percentage of those people had been using Twitter for something like four days.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   And didn't have a profile page.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.800]   President Obama's account is...
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   20 million.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   20 million.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   And then the White House account has 3.1 million.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   Right.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   It's interesting.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.800]   They are debating on Twitter or their proxies are debating on Twitter.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   That's very interesting.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   Although not as much stuff going, well, interesting.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   There's a whole list of things that I want to hear on the debate tonight, including, you know, well, Google it, Mitt.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   [laughter]
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   Do you think you will?
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   I don't know.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   I don't know.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   It wouldn't be great if we got some kind of techno-savvy moment.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   There is a debate drinking game at debatedrinking.com, but I don't see Google in here.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   But I wouldn't...
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.800]   Oh, I should just send a chair.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   I wouldn't be surprised if...
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   This will be a good measure.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   Look, this is clearly every, you know, every campaign, every four years.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   It's more and more influenced by the internet and digital and technology.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   I wouldn't be surprised at all to see some references to...
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   Certainly you'll see Twitter references, right?
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   Yep.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:35.800]   What an interesting idea, in a debate, to say what you have to say and say, "Hey, if you're interested in more, I've got a page with this."
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.800]   Right.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   Do you think the candidates might do that?
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   Oh, yeah, they've pushed what you are.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   Sure, but yeah.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   Well, remember...
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   Who was it?
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   Ralph Nader kept saying his 800 number and his...
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.800]   Exactly.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   Exactly.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   Or, you know, there's other phrases like, "Well, as I was saying on Twitter, Mr. President..."
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   Mmm.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:55.800]   I'll be listening for that.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.800]   I don't think we'll hear that.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.800]   Oh.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.800]   I think that this...
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   Or it could be...
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   Well, I was just reading what a citizen had to say on Twitter, Mr. President.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.800]   I think there's moments like they want to be cool.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   Right.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   We'll be watching for that with great interest.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   There's also an interesting thing that CNN is apparently doing, that they're going to allow people to spin out clips and then share it on social media in real time, replay things, and essentially give people the tools to spin out memes as they happen.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.800]   In other words, instead of people just talking about what... did he just say that?
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.800]   What did he just say?
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.800]   You'll be able to just attach a video on Africa, so link to that.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.800]   Wow.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:48.800]   I remember four years ago, there was a lot of controversy that the networks were not allowing clips of the debates to go up.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.800]   You had to go to their site and watch the whole thing back to us.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   Boy, that's terrible.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   That'd be good.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   It's our...
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   It's our future.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   So, I wonder what Facebook's going to do.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   I wonder what... is it going to be broadcast live on YouTube?
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   Yes.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   Wow.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   Nice.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.800]   Wow.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   Boy, I tell you, everything is now being brought... the Olympics are broadcast live on YouTube.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   The conventions are broadcast live on YouTube.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   Now, the debate that broadcast live on YouTube, YouTube really is...
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   It's Romney better not mention Chipotle.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.800]   They're going to pull the whole thing.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   Wow.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.800]   That's interesting.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   Very interesting.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:39.800]   I'll have to... I'll have to... I wonder how many people will watch it on YouTube versus watching it on TV.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800]   It'll be tiny.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.800]   Tiny.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.800]   But I think it makes a big statement.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   Hmm.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   The question... I think what Mike just said about the ability to go in and send clips around next to that stuff.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.800]   You need that added functionality to be the convenience of television as a reason to use the media.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:58.800]   Right.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:54:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   Let's see.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   Google passes Microsoft's market value.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   Last week, he said that it was the fifth largest company and the third largest tech company and now it's number two tech company.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:14.800]   Wow.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:28.800]   By merely by rising 1%, it's stock market value went to $761 a share at the close, giving it a market capitalization at the end of the day yesterday of $250 billion.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   I think it's interesting to look at the rise of Google's share price because I think it's the...
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   My gut feeling is that it's Wall Street acceptance of the new Larry version of Google.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:47.800]   He's cutting a lot of underperforming and perforal properties.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   He's doing all those things that he should do and he's running the company really well.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.800]   I think the comparison with Microsoft though is loopy.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.800]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   I mean, Microsoft has this...
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.800]   Or maybe because it's ranking Mike.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:00.800]   I think.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.800]   This is kind of like talking about the iPhone three weeks before the iPhone ships.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.800]   There's always this dip.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:17.800]   I mean, Microsoft is coming in toward the end of a period where it's got an old operating system, old versions of office, all that kind of stuff.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   And I think there's a reasonably good chance that after Windows 8 ships and after they sort of like sort of reconstitute themselves as they do occasionally, they could surpass Google again.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   And there's no connection really between Microsoft's business and Google's business.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   Being, for example, is not a significant part of Microsoft's revenue.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.800]   No, in fact, it's a drain on revenue.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.800]   They're a huge amount of money.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   They pour into online.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   Yeah, but to look at the...
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   You wear the two companies, yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:57.800]   Since 2000, Microsoft stock has held pretty much, between 20 and 40 bucks is very consistent.
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.800]   I'm going to hit the chart right now.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   That much has happened there.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.800]   Google has really...
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.800]   They are tech companies.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.800]   They are different models.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   Google really has seen a distributed model that Microsoft couldn't imagine.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:15.800]   And now we have Microsoft trying to copy Google and doing things like phones and other services.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:21.800]   And they're still, I think, struggling to find their place in this world.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:27.800]   And one of the stories in the rundown is that Microsoft is going to start a new news service
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   when it gave up MSNBC and the sale to NBC.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   I put that in just for you.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.800]   Yeah, now they're done.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   I only knew that.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:39.800]   One of my former editors, when I worked at Advanced Publications, Dean Betz is there.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.800]   And the way he put it to me was not that they were adding website for news.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.800]   He's there to edit news for Windows 8.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.800]   They're adding content into the OS.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.800]   Yeah, they have a great little news tile, actually.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.800]   It's actually really nicely done.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.800]   And it's by default on the front page of all Windows 8 devices.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   The tablets, the phones, as well as the desktops.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   And it's already beautiful.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   And when you use it full screen, it's actually a gorgeous looking newspaper.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.800]   That's it.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.800]   So that's what the news operation is designed for.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.800]   So they're hiring human editors, unlike Google News.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:20.800]   And there are licensing full-scale content winners in the P&Saj.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   And they're going to try to create a content business again.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:25.800]   They've tried again and again.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.800]   And in the past, and it might be great.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:34.800]   But it just kind of, I think it indicates, Mike, that Microsoft is, you could view it two ways.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   Flailing a bit or stagnant a bit.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:44.800]   I mean, it's so frustrating with Microsoft because they have so many cool things that they could
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.800]   really turn into monsters.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.800]   I mean, you look at Connect and all the potential there is in Connect.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   I'll give it to Rand.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.800]   Except that everybody raises.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.800]   Name two.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   Well, okay.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:55.800]   Here's another one.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:59.800]   Microsoft Pixel Sense, which is their gigantic iPad.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:07.800]   You know, this thing has been, you know, they acquired Perceptive Pixel, which was the other big screen, you know, gigantic thing.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   And they're kind of doing these, they're using this technology, which is breathtakingly good,
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   for vertical things, for casinos and nightclubs and retail and stuff like that.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   We really need big, big, big bold things out of Microsoft, like, for example, coming out with a big Pixel Sense table for consumers.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.800]   You know, charge is charged $4,000, or even $5,000 for.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.800]   But come out with something that runs Windows 8.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   That's a big gigantic touch table.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.800]   I mean, do something really bold like that.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.800]   Do something really bold with Connect.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:44.800]   I mean, they're going to have a Connect for Windows 8 for the desktop, which I think is fantastic,
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:50.800]   but they're not quite connecting this some really leading-edge technology with the broader consumer marketplace
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   and the way that Apple is so good at doing.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   So it's just frustrating that they have all these little things that are great.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.800]   I mean, Windows, the Windows phones are great.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.800]   The surface looks promising.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.800]   But let's, you know, start, you know, let's beat it up here, guys.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.800]   This is a new world and you can't just like drag your feet for years.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   I mean, Balmer was talking about a consumer version of what was then called the Surface, now called Pixel Sense.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   What was that, two years ago?
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.800]   He was saying, yeah, we're on the edge of coming out with a consumer version.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.800]   I haven't heard a word.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.800]   I guess maybe that turned into the Surface tablet.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   That's probably right, man.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.800]   I think that the new operation is probably considered kind of diminumous for Microsoft.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.800]   It's just that, well, we have the real estate on the screen.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.800]   Why not take advantage of it?
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.800]   And give some value back.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.800]   Give some value back.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   And I wouldn't be surprised if there's some bing-ness in there.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.800]   You know, this goes back to my thinking about the Chromebook today.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.800]   And I know you both laugh at me because it's, you know, meant for Rammas.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.800]   But would it be possible to live fully in Google?
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   What's left of my Microsoft Play?
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.800]   Just Word.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800]   That.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800]   That's a good point.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:04.800]   And the only reason I use Word is because my editors insist that I use Word in that.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.800]   It's a legacy.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   It's become a legacy.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.800]   It's a legacy.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.800]   Although I have to say in accounting, our staff needs Excel and uses Excel.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   So the spreadsheet may stay vital in business.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.800]   But of course, I don't add a journalist, so I need to do that.
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   And the other thing I'm about to call my broker and sell my Microsoft to buy Facebook.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.800]   Really?
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.800]   Is that because Facebook's so low?
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800]   Why not?
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800]   And Microsoft has been stagnant.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.800]   I've been living at $35 Microsoft for, and not that I have much folks.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800]   I don't.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.800]   But just as a way to kind of keep track on the industry.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.800]   It's a way to make me look it up every day.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.800]   And Microsoft's at $30.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:52.800]   By the way, in the same article, Microsoft also says that it hired a former CBS executive
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.800]   to run a studio generating content for the Xbox.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.800]   So Mike, you might have something there.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:05.800]   It might be that Microsoft is thinking, here's a way to use our platforms and get some more
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.800]   value out of them.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.300]   I think that what they all should be doing and what some of them are really trying to
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:18.300]   do, Apple's certainly trying to do it, is to have the soup to nuts thing through something
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.800]   iCloud or something like it.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.800]   And Apple doesn't do content.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   They sell other people's content.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.800]   I mean, they do a little, okay, there's the iTunes concerts they do in September, but
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.800]   that's about it.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.800]   Yeah, I mean, they don't do it yet.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   There's so many of these barriers that are being broken.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   You know, Google bought Motorola.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.800]   You know, there's all these strange things that these areas that you think, well, that
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.800]   company doesn't do that.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   Everybody's like trampling those barriers.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:54.800]   And so, you know, I think Apple will be happy to make content if it makes sense for them.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800]   Google is doing it.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.800]   Who's doing it?
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.800]   I don't think, no, Google does not doing content.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.680]   They're not owning and creating content.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.840]   They remain a platform for it.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.440]   They would be in channel conflict.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.440]   Apple would be a job.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.840]   Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're wrong.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:11.640]   They spend $150 million on YouTube channels creating content for YouTube and they're going
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.640]   to do another $200 million in the fall.
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   They don't own them.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.640]   They don't own them.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   They don't own them.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   They invest in them.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   They want to encourage it, which is just--
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   No, that's a very good point.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:23.120]   And in fact, I was surprised to hear those contract deals do not, in fact, own give them
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.120]   ownership of the content.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.760]   Just like NG, underwriting soap operas or northern exposure.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.800]   They want more stuff there.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   They need more stuff there.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.840]   And so the way they get it is to invest in it, but they do not want to find themselves
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:39.240]   in channel conflict with the likes of us.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.240]   And I think that's right.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.960]   So I think Apple's in the same boat, whereas content has been the strategy of Yahoo.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.840]   We'll see if it stays that under Marissa.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.680]   And it is the sole strategy of AOL.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.600]   And apparently Microsoft maybe.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.600]   Although it could just be--
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.480]   Microsoft has gotten it, tried to get into it before.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.480]   They started to be--
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.480]   Besides MSNBC, what else?
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.480]   MSN.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.480]   MSN.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.480]   Slate.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.480]   Slate.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.360]   So this is not new for Microsoft?
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.360]   It's not new.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.360]   It's always been kind of a little side business.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.080]   It's a side business, yeah.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.080]   It's a side show.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.080]   Side show.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.640]   It's basically somebody who says, "We have all these people who don't change their home
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:25.080]   pages and we have a potential of a quote-unquote "firehose" whose favorite phrase, AOL's 2.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.760]   And so when we point it, we got to have something to point it at once it will benefit us.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:33.400]   And so back in the day, I was one of many who did deals with Microsoft or was around
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.200]   them rather for content companies.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.440]   We said, "We'll point the firehose at you.
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.440]   What's it worth being?"
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.640]   And you want to get wet?
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.720]   Can I not have them pointed at me?
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.080]   How much is that worth?
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.640]   Google, you talked about Larry Page and Spring Cleaning Google is, we're still waiting to
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.440]   hear about Feedburner.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.200]   I don't know why there's, they haven't said anything, have they?
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.800]   But the strong impression people have that Feedburner is going to be going away.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.800]   Dead man walking.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800]   Dead man walking.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:10.040]   And one indicator is that they have killed AdSense for feeds, feeds, which is pretty much
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.720]   the way Feedburner monetizes.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.640]   So maybe they will stop Feedburner.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.680]   I don't know if there's a lot of people rely on Feedburner to create their feeds.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.880]   Remember we all wrote blogs and used Feedburner.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.560]   A lot of podcasts use Feedburner actually.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.560]   Oh, that's true.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560]   That's true.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.480]   I actually use Feedburner too, because what I do is I automatically publish my Google
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:38.120]   Plus feed as a newsletter and I use Feedburner as part of that process because I get an RSS
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:43.920]   feed from a generator, these different companies that will spin out, give you an RSS feed
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.160]   of your Google Plus feed.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.680]   But that doesn't work with MailChimp, which is what I use to send the newsletter.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.840]   So I kind of wander it through Feedburner.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.800]   And so I don't know where else I'll do that.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.720]   I'm sure there's some other place to do it.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.560]   But what I don't understand is why would Google want to kill this thing?
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.040]   It doesn't seem like it's a high maintenance service.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.800]   But they've, but they've, but they've, but they've, but they've, but they've, but they've
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.040]   been pointing out at various times, they've killed it.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.040]   That's not the equation.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.920]   The equation is, is this business beneficial for Google or not?
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.000]   And they're killing things that are small and harmless, but they're getting rid of them.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.760]   Here's another question for you.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.320]   Is this a window onto Dick Costello's brain?
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.320]   Right.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:25.200]   Because Dick was the CEO of, of Feedburner.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.400]   I never understood a business model for Feedburner.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.400]   Hmm.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.400]   Dick's the CEO of Twitter.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.400]   I still don't understand.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.400]   It's just a matter.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.800]   Maybe Dick Costello is the problem.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.680]   So the evidence that they're going to kill Feedburner is that there is no longer a Feedburner
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.960]   and Google Plus account.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.200]   There is no longer a Feedburner Twitter account.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.120]   And the API feed was taken offline.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.760]   And now they've chopped off its ability to monetize.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.000]   I have a feeling there.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.360]   This is death by a thousand cuts.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.160]   They're slowly cutting it out.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.720]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.240]   You have no alternatives because that's one of my RSS feed for the blog.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.240]   All right.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:04.600]   Well, here's a call out to Gina and all you programmers.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.800]   We need a feed burner replacement stat.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.800]   You know, it's so funny.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.640]   I use Feedburner for my blog too, but I just never look at it.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.480]   I mean, I guess I'm just going to use the WordPress, you know, whatever.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.080]   My CMS is just raw feed.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.160]   I guess Feedburner gives you those stats about how many people are subscribed.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.560]   Yeah, but I use them.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.080]   What was the last time you looked, Gina?
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.560]   I don't remember.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.360]   Five years, six years.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.360]   A long time.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360]   I mean, a long time.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.960]   Remember when the little bug, the Feedburner bug with how many subscribers that you have
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.120]   was so popular?
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.680]   My concern is that this means that the Google's kind of doesn't care about RSS as much anymore,
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.120]   which means that, you know, maybe reader won't be around as much.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.840]   You know, I'm just kind of worried like that the old school days of news readers and RSS
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.440]   feeds might be old over.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.840]   And I shouldn't be worried.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.840]   Maybe that's a good thing.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.760]   You know, I just always been kind of hostile about it in Chrome.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:58.440]   You go to RSS, most browsers you just paste in an RSS, you know, XML link and it just
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.680]   shows it to you in Chrome.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.640]   It's all, well, you should download a plug in.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   Right.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.320]   You know, it's like, I never understood their hostility to that format.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.480]   RSS is good.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.640]   I just wonder what a whiter has to say about that.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.960]   Make it four out of four now.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   We all use Feedburner.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:17.240]   I just realized I use Feedburner on my blog too to make for an email version.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.040]   They make an email out of it.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040]   That's right.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.760]   I forgot that.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.280]   That's why they're dragging their tail on actually killing actual things because they
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.720]   start pulling the thread out of the internet.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.160]   And it's like everybody's using this thing.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:42.040]   [inaudible]
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.280]   We can't understand.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.280]   We can't understand you.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   I don't know why.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.280]   You're getting a transmission from the Martian.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.480]   Where is your voir.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.040]   I think you're back.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:57.960]   By the way, this email subscription to my blog, let me see how many subscribers I have.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.960]   Oh, zero.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:06.480]   I've been doing that for five years and I have zero.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:12.880]   You could increase that by 300 percent right now if we all end up.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.320]   No, don't because who knows how long it will last.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.640]   But, Leo, that's your tech guy audience.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   Isn't it?
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.480]   I guess they'd be more likely to use an email newsletter though.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.040]   I am puzzled.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.640]   Zero subscribers, zero reach.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.080]   Even money it says from all that traffic.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.560]   They still are advertising ad sense for feeds, even though they've killed it.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.080]   Well, I must be doing something wrong.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.200]   So if I might as well take that block out of my blog.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.200]   How funny.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.080]   What if I subscribe now?
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:52.680]   Not that I put anything on my blog anymore, but maybe they killed Feedburner and no one
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.440]   noticed.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.440]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.120]   Well, what Jesus was before that you write though.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.960]   Imagine the day after when you go to a reader.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   Right.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.600]   But I'm concerned about reader in general.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.000]   Feedburner has to help Google do some really cool stuff with reader, right?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.080]   Some good optimizations and they have data about what's going on with those feeds through
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.440]   Feedburner.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.920]   If they get rid of Feedburner, does that mean that they're going to get rid of Google Reader
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.280]   eventually too?
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.040]   Or is this Google saying, "If this happens, are we in a post-RSS world?
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.880]   Is it all going to be Google+?"
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.520]   But that doesn't work for so much stuff.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.520]   Yep, I know.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.520]   I know it.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.400]   Email does it work.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.760]   Email is the brokenest of feeds.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.400]   How many of you go through a news reader every day?
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.160]   I use Flipboard now instead of a news reader.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.160]   Flipboard.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.160]   Okay.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.160]   Jeff and Mike, do you guys use a...
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.160]   I use it for my ego stuff.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160]   Uh-huh.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.160]   Okay.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.160]   Right.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.160]   Starting off there.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.000]   Once there, I use it for certain feeds.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.440]   You know, I used to have about 100 feeds.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.880]   Now I probably go through half a dozen.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.120]   And you look at it every day.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.280]   You check your feeds every day.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280]   Okay.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.280]   Okay.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280]   Currents.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.440]   Anybody use Currents?
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.280]   You know, when I was at Google, I said something about it.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.640]   I should use Currents more.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   Nobody said yes you should.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.120]   They all go short.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.280]   That's sad.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.840]   I think they don't know what Currents is.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.480]   It's a nice little app, but it's not Feedburner.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.480]   It's nice.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480]   Feedburner is really...
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480]   Uh, not Feedburner.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480]   Flipboard is really the thing.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.480]   Flipboarder.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.480]   It's nice.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.480]   I really like Flipboard.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.520]   And it's kind of like reading your feeds, except that the feed's coming from Twitter,
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.480]   not from RSS.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.480]   Uh-huh.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.480]   Right.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.480]   Um...
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:50.240]   I don't understand, but Gina can probably explain, Google wants to make your videos.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.480]   Make your site a little bit faster with its new tag manager.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.760]   Yes, please explain.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.000]   I don't know what the hell that means.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   I read it.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.240]   I still don't understand it.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   Would you explain it?
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.360]   Uh, you know, I read it too.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.360]   And this is...
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.520]   This is kind of a weird product, but I'm not totally sure I understand.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.960]   This is what I think it does.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.760]   So the idea is that when you run a site, you drop in a bunch of little widgets and tags
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:15.720]   for marketing metrics and analytics and ads and things like that.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.600]   And Google's saying that those things slow down your webpage when it loads.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.920]   So from what I understand, tag manager is, and I hope Google is in people chatroom correct
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.960]   me if I get this wrong, is that it's a way to set up all those tags through Google and
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:33.600]   then just put that tag, you know, tag, meaning like the HTML markup in your page and that
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.680]   routes it through Google and that speeds up your page.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.080]   So they're caching.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.520]   So, uh, caching, yeah.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.040]   Yeah, it just provides, you know, it makes it faster.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:48.640]   And I think also it means that people in marketing don't have to go to the web developer
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.160]   to say, "Hey, can you just drop this new widget onto every page in the site?"
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.520]   But it also just gives a web front end to marketing folks to do that on their own through Google.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.520]   That's what I think it does.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.360]   But it's really weird.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.920]   I mean, it's not just you, Leo.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.520]   Like the description of the product is weird, is a little weirdly vague.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.920]   Let me read it from the Google Tag Manager page.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.840]   Why use Google Tag Manager?
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:17.800]   Google Tag Manager is free and easy, leaving more time and money to spend on your marketing
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.000]   campaigns.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.600]   You manage your tags yourself with easy to use web interface rather than forcing you or
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.800]   your IT department to write or rewrite site code.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.800]   Maybe marketers understand that.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.520]   Yeah, I think it's just a way to say here's, we're dropping in code.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.520]   This is, these are all our marketing analytics tags and now our marketing department can just
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.640]   manage them through Google instead of having a message.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.640]   So it's some sort of analytics.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.200]   And does Google learn all that stuff as it passes?
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.200]   Google gets a lot of information.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.600]   I mean, that's what's really interesting about this, right?
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.960]   And it works with services which are not in Google as well.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:56.320]   So yeah, you're basically routing through Google for other services.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.880]   What are, I guess what I don't know is what is a tag?
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:01.080]   What does it, what do they mean when they say tag?
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.920]   I, yeah, this is a really weird name from what I, from what I think it has.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.560]   It's not what we think it is.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:13.200]   It's a snippet of JavaScript or an iframe or, you know, like those little bits of code
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.200]   that we add to the bottom of our pages to do analytics.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.440]   And you know, more information.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440]   I think it's a tag.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440]   Google analytics is a tag.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.440]   Right.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.440]   Google analytics, for example, right.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.440]   It would be a tag, right.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.440]   Right.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.440]   Right.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.240]   I do not think that word means what you think it means.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:33.000]   There was, remember back in the day when there were ping services that you had something
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   new on your site.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.160]   Not Apple ping, but you could.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160]   No, no, no, no.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.960]   You know, we just had this conversation because there's no way to let iTunes know that you've
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.960]   updated the feed anymore.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.440]   You used to be able to ping them and say, hey, the feeds knew would you reload.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.440]   Right.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.440]   I can't do that anymore.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.440]   Right.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.440]   They took it out.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.920]   And so the problem was that you had all kinds of RSS servers and such.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.400]   This is all RSS where they, it's very related to the previous topic, trying to constantly
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.400]   go to servers.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.880]   So instead, right, there was a creation.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.240]   Dave Winder was involved in this where, where you would ping out and it would ping everybody
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.240]   for you.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.240]   Right.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.720]   And that got bought by, I think, Veracine.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:08.720]   Not come to the day.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.200]   Because that was going to be really valuable.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.520]   You knew where all the fresh content was.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.320]   And Google scaled up by just saying, oh, heck, we'll just check everywhere.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.320]   We're at 10 seconds.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.800]   You know, you're not thinking of ping FM.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.800]   That's something else.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.800]   That was something else.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.960]   This was, this was so that you could update all kinds of feed servers that you had new
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.960]   content.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.880]   This is how old I am in this business, children.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.720]   I remember ping services.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.720]   I do too.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.280]   No, no, that was something we used as podcasters.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.880]   When you posted a feed, you would ping all these different places and let them know.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.200]   I'm sensing the tag things like that.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.520]   El Shina, that you ping once to notify many.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.520]   Yes.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:51.720]   And here you tag once to analytics in many.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:52.720]   Right.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.680]   One tag on the site and then you can manage those in Google's web interface.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.440]   I think that it is like that.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.600]   But I haven't signed up for it.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.400]   It seems like this is more like for marketing departments, for, you know, companies with
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.000]   huge websites that are constantly adding different tags for various.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.200]   Here's the other interesting thing.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:12.000]   I wonder about this and I guess I don't know.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.240]   I understand tags at all.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.240]   Is each tag.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:17.800]   No, that's just putting on a cookie.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.800]   Did I do it again?
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.800]   No.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:26.200]   Oh, in other words, does this unify the cookie to?
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:31.680]   Because of each analytics, each tracker, let's say you're on, on Omniture or Google Analytics
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.880]   and, and another, right?
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:37.840]   If you're going to unify those three tags, have you unified the cookie that each of those
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.680]   is placing on the users?
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:43.400]   And thus, does Google really have a lot of information coming in?
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.400]   Has their privacy issue?
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.400]   Good question.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   I would think so.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:52.620]   I mean, it sounds like tag manager does associate the various tags from, from different
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:54.600]   third parties into one, right?
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.800]   That's the value of the service.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.080]   So yeah, it sounds like Google would have a lot more information about your site that
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.080]   you're sending.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.520]   It would be easier if we just use the word snippet code snippet.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.520]   Because that's really what it is.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.120]   It's a snippet of code that Google is caching on your behalf.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.320]   Yeah, I mean, I imagine just a piece of HTML.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.040]   The chat remeber execs, who has a lot of good answers about these questions coming by,
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.400]   says each tags a cookie, but Google tags does not unify them.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.680]   Okay, I'm going to move on.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.160]   I'm going to give up.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.080]   Okay, I thought that this will, I would get clarity out of this.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.840]   Now I'm even more confused.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.280]   It's something to do with SEO.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.280]   No.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.440]   It's, it's, it's about speed.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.440]   It's about speed.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.440]   It's about speed.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.000]   But yeah, that next might be right.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.160]   That maybe it doesn't unify them.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.680]   It does sound like you associate the tags though all in one place and say this is my
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.680]   site.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:45.680]   So I don't know.
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:46.680]   I'm a good stick.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.680]   Cookie tracking.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.680]   That's, that's my position.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.520]   Yeah, I'm again against the whole thing.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.080]   I don't know what it is, but I'm again it.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.360]   Google warns of new state sponsored cyber attacks.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:05.480]   In fact, if you go to, you, some many people, if they go to their inbox on Gmail or your
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.960]   Google homepage or your Chrome browser, you might see this warning warning.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:14.520]   We believe state sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your account or
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:15.520]   computer.
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:20.520]   I had somebody call me on the radio show this weekend saying, what the hell is that?
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.520]   The company said that since it started alerting users to malicious activity on their computers
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.800]   in June, it's picked up thousands more instances of cyber attacks than anticipated.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:34.040]   This must be related to the malware monitoring that they do.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:39.520]   And it turns out that they believe many of these are state sponsored.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:45.040]   So tens of thousands of users starting Tuesday afternoon and been receiving this warning.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.840]   How can I get a state sponsor?
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.840]   Wow.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.120]   No, that's a sign.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:55.600]   That's a sign of that you're important.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.160]   Everyone is going after you.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:01.280]   I mean, I think I really do think that they're mostly concerned about China.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.960]   They don't want to use the C word and also to a state structure.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.280]   No, but they're talking about the Middle East.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.960]   That was a denial of service attack.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.320]   You know, that's, you know, that.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:19.240]   No, it says that Iran Qatar and the UAE and Bahrain, if you spyware to monitor citizens
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.120]   and activists overseas.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:27.720]   And then American banks were hit with cyber attacks by hackers claiming Middle Eastern
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.360]   ties last week.
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.200]   So it's not just de-dossing.
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.600]   It's hacking.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.480]   So if you, I haven't seen this warning, none of us have received this warning.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.480]   Nope.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.480]   No.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.480]   Your account could be at risk.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480]   Something wrong.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   Yes.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480]   I'm not important enough.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.480]   Huh.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.840]   Anybody in the chatroom receive a receive a receive this?
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.080]   I'm going to start pushing that on Tuesday.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:58.760]   I mean, the next thing is for hackers to spoof state sponsorships.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:04.920]   You know, you need a dot C and address and you're good to go.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:09.600]   Oh, we'll have things advertised soon, you know, cyber terrorism watch.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.560]   We'll keep your children safe and make sure they're never cyber terrorized.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:19.600]   From Matt cuts the word that the plus one does not affect your search rankings.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.680]   And even some from firmly blunt, honest language about how it's not a very good signal.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.720]   He says there's he says in a, I love that.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.720]   I love that man.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:34.280]   He was in a hangout power searching with Google hangout on air.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.840]   Number two, he said, quote, in the short term, we're still going to have to study and see
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.040]   how good the signal is.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:43.240]   So right now there is not really a direct effect where if you have a lot of plus ones,
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:48.040]   you'll rank higher, but there are things like we have an authorship proposal where you can
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.960]   use nice standards to mark up your web page and you'll actually see a picture that's we've
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.960]   been doing that.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   I've done that certainly.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:57.960]   I don't know if that's ex a fan or what they're doing, but you see a picture of the
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:02.360]   author and it turns out if you see a picture of the author, sometimes you have a higher
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:06.200]   click through and people will say, Oh, that looks like a trusted resource.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.360]   So there are ways you can participate.
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:11.440]   They want somebody else to be able to draw.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:18.000]   I am an untrusted resource, but if you Google Leo report, there will be in the Google results,
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.240]   some results that have a picture of me.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.960]   Those are the ones that I've said.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:26.040]   These are my pages, right?
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.040]   So there it is.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.040]   It's fantastic.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:33.160]   I actually convinced all of my editors to implement it.
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:38.520]   They're mostly thinking about it anyway on the sites because what was happening was because
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:44.440]   of the tie in with Google+, at Google+ profiles, the post that I would do to promote my work
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:48.440]   on other sites was having a higher rank than the destination site.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:53.520]   And because of the author thing and my picture was there and then the actual article was
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.320]   further down with no picture.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:59.480]   And so now that they've implemented that, actually Google results now puts the destination
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:03.520]   site on top with my picture and it's a beautiful thing.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.960]   And my stuff is easier to find.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:11.240]   But regarding this plus one thing, plus ones are, if you plus one something outside of
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:17.520]   Google+, it affects outside of Google+, if you plus one it within Google+, of course,
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:21.000]   it adds it up and you can say, "Oh, wow, this thing got 100 plus ones."
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.360]   That means it's better than twice as good as something you got 50.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:30.160]   But the best use of plus ones is actually to save content because everything you plus
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.960]   one is remembered on Google+ and you can go to your profile and look at all the things
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.960]   that you plus one.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:40.680]   So if you want to save something for later, just plus one it and it will be on the list.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.320]   But if you plus, so this is one of my grapes.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:48.460]   If I go to my plus ones on Google+, I only see pages that I've plus one off of Google
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:52.960]  +, I don't see all the Google+ posts inside plus that I've plus one.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.960]   Right, right.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.560]   Is there a way to get to those?
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.240]   No, isn't that the strange thing?
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.240]   What's up with that?
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:04.920]   Yeah, and of course you have to be logged in when you're elsewhere to plus one things.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.120]   It's hard to remember that.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.120]   But yeah, I think they just don't know what to do with it.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:17.200]   I think they'd like to have it be a search signal, but it would be so easily gained and
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.760]   it would mess up search.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.760]   So I don't know.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.200]   It's really a strange phenomenon that nobody quite fully understands.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.400]   I can't find the plus ones.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.400]   Oh, there they are, plus ones.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.400]   I got it.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.440]   Yeah, so you go ahead that tab.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.440]   Right.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:36.920]   And I honestly rarely plus one anything outside of Google+, you know.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:39.640]   I just got plus Leo report as my URL.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.280]   Oh, sweet.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:44.520]   One of the things, one of the few guys probably already have that, but I just noticed that
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520]   I have it.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:50.400]   One of the things that happens when you plus one something outside of Google+, is it opens
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:55.960]   up a box for you to post it on Google+, and I think that's off-putting for people.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:00.840]   I think it kind of trains people that like you just want to click it and have it turn
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.400]   red and move on with your life.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.960]   But instead it opens this thing and sort of like gilts you into like posting something.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:11.520]   And I think they'd be better off if they just had it be a more normal thing and work
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:15.080]   more like the Facebook like button.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.240]   So we've pre-approved this URL for your profile.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.640]   And then if you agree to the terms of service, you can claim it or you can request a different
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.640]   one.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.640]   Maybe I could ask to be Gina Trappani.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.040]   Oh, no, you can't because I've got that already.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.040]   Oh, rats.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.960]   You can only have one custom URL.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.400]   Once you claim it, you can't change your transfer it.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.080]   Are you sure you want to be posting sex change operation for you?
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:41.680]   No, I'm going to be Leo LaPorte forevermore.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.080]   Leo LaPorte, Leo.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.640]   Not Leo.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.640]   Or not Helen.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   I'm sure you guys have talked about this on previous shows, but it works with multiple versions.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:56.640]   So you can do Google.me/leo-port and it works the same.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.040]   Oh, Google, isn't it just Google.com?
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.040]   You can do Google.com/leo-port.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:04.480]   Google.me/ plus Leo LaPorte.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:05.680]   Yeah, plus, yeah.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.280]   Yes, that's right, plus.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.600]   So that's what I'm using on my signature for email.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.360]   I use Google.me plus.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.280]   When no one was looking, I changed everyone's lower third to Google.com plus their thing.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.680]   Oh, now you can change mine too.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:25.760]   Well, I didn't do it to yours because I got a full of war until right.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.760]   Did you just claim it?
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.760]   Refresh.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.000]   Just to-- or just to-- it's Leo LaPorte.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   What, yeah, all my work.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.680]   Maybe it has a propagated through the Google sphere.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.800]   What's interesting is that Google actually puts the case.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.640]   So at like upper cases, the GNT in my name.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.640]   Nice name.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.400]   And URLs are case insensitive.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.400]   Like I just-- that rose me the wrong way.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.800]   That rose me the wrong way.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.720]   I have a hard enough time with the plus, which is actually a URL encoded space.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:58.120]   Like the fact that they've sort of repurposed the plus to be like a different namespace.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.320]   They're also making adding upper case.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.320]   Oh, there we go.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.320]   Google.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.920]   I'm doing it, Google.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.080]   URLs are case insensitive.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.160]   I mean, it makes them more readable, fine.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:09.680]   Right.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.200]   Fine.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.360]   I suppose it makes it better for humans.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.800]   Oh, this damn humans.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:18.160]   Ruining our algorithmic perfection.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.720]   That's not very algorithmic.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.560]   I don't know.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.200]   Google has patented a smartwatch.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:33.200]   Somebody said that Apple missed a bet by not keeping the nano.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.440]   I attempted to buy one before they go off sales so I can have an nano watch.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:42.840]   But they'll-- no, then Peter Rojas-- and I think he's smart of gadget.com-- said, oh, no, this is all planned.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:46.720]   Next year, they'll introduce the Apple wearable iPod.
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.280]   I think Peter's exactly right.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.040]   I think he nailed it.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.840]   And I think they're going to have a watch.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.760]   And I think everybody's going to have a watch.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.360]   I think apparently Google is--
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:54.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:56.960]   Well, I mean, that's a future--
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.040]   that's the watch version of Project Glass.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:03.640]   Yeah, because it has a camera and a clear flip up cover that
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:06.080]   can display augmented reality information.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.680]   Yeah, but that's not going to be out by Christmas.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:14.600]   I can assure you that that's a pretty far off project.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.440]   Google, you shouldn't have made it so specific.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.280]   You should have just patented wearable watches,
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.560]   and then you could own everybody.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:28.200]   Come from now on non-specific patents, OK?
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.520]   New pay for engagement ad form.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.880]   I guess this goes along with tag clouds or whatever the hell.
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:38.840]   Well, this little bit of a--
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.960]   is a variation on pay per click.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:42.560]   It's pay for engagement.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.480]   You don't pay, advertiser, unless someone engages with the form.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:46.920]   Wow.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.000]   And it's a blow up thing that takes over the screen.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.880]   And if you do that, then the advertiser's happy
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.520]   and the advertiser pays.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:56.840]   And the user is pissed.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:57.880]   So--
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.600]   No, the user supposedly has had a choice
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.080]   and has chosen to engage with this.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.000]   So the user is--
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.920]   Yeah, we're trying to find the close box.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.160]   We're not engaging with it.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.840]   We're trying to get rid of it.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:08.600]   No, it's the opposite.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.160]   I think, Leo.
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.320]   I think it's just an ad on the page.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.040]   But it's a lightbox, Dad.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:14.560]   Right.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.120]   Just clicking the close button, it counters interaction.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.200]   Yeah, I'm interacting with you.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.800]   I'll get to your interaction right here.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.560]   I'm trying to find an example.
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:24.000]   Is that one's apple?
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.840]   With creative--
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.200]   I love this.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.520]   This is from the Google Inside AdWords blog.
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:35.680]   When creativity and technology work hand in hand,
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:39.880]   brands can build amazing things online.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.720]   Woo!
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.200]   We're schmuck to write that stuff.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.400]   Oh, man.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.920]   I'm so depressed.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:48.680]   It is really depressed.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.320]   That's really depressing.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:53.000]   The idea of brands building amazing things online
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000]   is what it's depressing.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.120]   So instead of seeing an ad on a page, you see a lightbox--
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:02.720]   basically, it's using the lightboxing in Google Plus, right?
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.160]   That's the same look.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.160]   Looks like it.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:06.680]   True.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:11.560]   And so just know, folks, at home.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.920]   When you click around in there, man, people
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.000]   are happy about that.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   Paying big bucks for that engagement.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:24.920]   AOL is now on YouTube.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.000]   Yep, they've performed their stuff.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.040]   Well, don't forget AOL now with Huffington Post.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:28.680]   Is Huffington Post?
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.640]   Huffington Post is now video, video, video.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.880]   I want this to be a question.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:36.040]   So is it one of the new YouTube channels,
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.360]   or is it in AOL channels?
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:38.360]   I think it's everything.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.360]   I think it's everything that AOL is.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.040]   It's multiple channels.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:47.760]   22 branded channels, including HuffPost Live, TechCrunch,
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.760]   and Movie Phone.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.840]   TechCrunch on YouTube.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.840]   So I guess they're making so much video now
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.800]   that they can post these.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.800]   That's funny, because of course we've got a YouTube channel.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:05.160]   But if you're a big corporation, you have to, like, announce it.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.720]   YouTube has a Turkish site.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.920]   Well, that's a big deal because--
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.960]   They're giving the government control.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.360]   Exactly.
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:16.640]   Turkey has insisted on a .tk site
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.880]   so that it could then tell Google what to take off.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:21.880]   Wow.
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:25.240]   Things that attack, add to Turkey, and such aren't allowed.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.720]   And they also want taxation money.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:30.760]   But Google says we pay taxes in every country we're in already.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.240]   Right.
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.080]   And Turkey's in the news right now as we go on the air
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.880]   because they've shot back at Syria.
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:38.720]   Oh, no.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.640]   Really?
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.680]   Bombs go in both ways.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.520]   They're right.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:47.200]   And it's likely that I will be in Turkey in about a month.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.360]   Right.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.960]   So why?
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:50.960]   Give us a report.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.440]   Oh.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.040]   Hopefully the showing isn't going to come back
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.200]   in the other direction.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.800]   What I'm-- I'm scheduling right now a trip to Azerbaijan
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.040]   and then Istanbul.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:04.320]   Our war correspondent, Jeff Jarvis, is on the scene.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.520]   As the bombs are falling, Jeff, are you there?
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.720]   Can you hear me?
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:12.760]   Facebook wants the like button to be exempt from child privacy
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.200]   laws.
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:17.320]   Well, Facebook and Google and Apple and Twitter
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.400]   have all complained to the FTC about the copper regulations.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.720]   Facebook in particular has a problem with like.
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:24.960]   And then restrictions on that.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.400]   Because they're saying it's a matter of free speech.
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.560]   That a child has free speech and a child's being--
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.320]   Child does not have free speech.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.040]   Child does not have free speech.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.480]   Well, there's some argument about that.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.160]   The proposal that the Obama administration is
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.080]   considering to beef up child privacy laws
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:43.280]   could hamper America's ability to like, tweet,
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.840]   and share information on the ground.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.200]   So what?
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.080]   If you're under 13, you don't have a right to like, tweet,
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.080]   and share information on the web.
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.080]   Do you?
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.040]   It's 13-year-olds.
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.320]   It's not 18-year-olds.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.800]   It's 13-year-olds we're talking about.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:00.720]   I'd like to see them illegalize the use of the word
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.600]   like for 13-year-olds.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.800]   Well, the current rules require verifiable
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:10.400]   parental consent before collecting personal information
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.400]   from children younger than 13.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:14.840]   Oh, man.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.920]   I'm keeping it off of Facebook as long as I can.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.440]   So Facebook says-- and of course, the like collects information.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:24.640]   You have to have a Facebook account and be logged in.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:28.160]   But Facebook says you may not have an account if you're under 13.
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:29.880]   So I'm confused.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:32.240]   Yeah, I am too.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.320]   First of all, it's weird that this corporation is lecturing
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.280]   the US government on the First Amendment.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.240]   And secondly, they're basically claiming
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:44.040]   the right of free speech to people who are not
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.360]   authorized to use their service.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.640]   I'm going to disagree with you.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.040]   I think that we absolutely should
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.880]   be lecturing the FTC and government in these cases
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.400]   on free speech, just as broadcast networks
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:58.080]   had to lecture the FCC on free speech regularly.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.680]   I think it's the case here.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.120]   And I also think that what these companies are doing
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.880]   is saying there's precedent here.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.520]   And I've talked about this a lot before.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.960]   Now there's quite a hub up going on.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:11.040]   COPPA is seen as a success.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:12.000]   I see it as a failure.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.560]   I think children are the worst-served sector of society
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.240]   online because we've extended a stranger danger to the extent
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.560]   that children shouldn't be aligned at all.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.360]   So I mean, as in a God knows, by the time
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.680]   ETA is 13, what's going to be available?
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:27.160]   Well, I don't think this is onerous
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:30.440]   to say that you cannot collect personal information
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:34.040]   from children younger than 13 does not seem onerous.
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.600]   Unless you have the parents.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:40.240]   But there has also been talk about extending this to 18.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.960]   Well, that, I would agree, is wrong.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:45.520]   But do you not agree that requiring parental permission
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.480]   before collecting information?
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.000]   The problem was that there were these Disney sites
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.440]   that were aimed at five-year-olds,
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.760]   the six-year-olds, the seven-year-olds
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.960]   that were getting email, address, phone numbers.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.200]   But here's the problem, Leo.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:00.840]   It's the definition of what PII was, personal identification.
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:03.240]   And that's been broadened so much in this.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:07.280]   So when I was on a phone call with the FTC staff attorney
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.880]   on these regulation extensions,
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.760]   when I was part of a group called the Future of Privacy Forum,
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.440]   I think it's called, obviously I'm not a very engaged member
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.480]   if I can't remember the name.
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:19.440]   But anyway, and one of the people asked,
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.920]   well, if I had a geography game
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.080]   and I wanted to teach you something about distances
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.960]   and want to make it sensible to you
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:29.360]   and start with your hometown, could I do that?
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.640]   No.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.040]   Your parents would have to,
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.600]   could not through email, would have to do it through signing a piece
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:39.880]   of paper and scanning it in or faxing it
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.880]   or having a video conference with the company
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:43.120]   to get permission for that.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.000]   Yeah, but I don't think that breaks the functionality
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.520]   to say if I can't get your hometown.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.600]   Well, I'm just, but it's an example of what's wrong.
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:52.720]   As long as there's no other PII associated with it,
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.240]   the problem is that just having that broad location
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.520]   was defined as PII.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.200]   Nothing else you could get, nothing else you could do with it.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.800]   It's gone overboard there.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.840]   And that's the problem is there's a presumption
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:08.360]   that everything associated with kids at online
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.720]   and any information whatsoever is bad.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.800]   Facebook's argument here, they use Khan Academy as an example.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:16.600]   So let's say there's a 12 year old wants to study math.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:20.720]   Khan Academy monetizes by, among other things,
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.080]   putting a like button on there, okay?
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:28.280]   Quote, part of that this is Facebook's letter to the,
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.800]   is it the FTC?
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.960]   Yeah, the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:35.400]   They said, I don't know, I've lost my place
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.200]   'cause I scrolled up.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.200]   Part of the issue is
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:47.200]   that the social functionality widely used
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.040]   by educational sites and apps is dependent on plugins,
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.480]   like like, like is a plugin in this case
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.960]   and could be threatened by the copper rule
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.880]   that renders plugin providers responsible for the actions
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.800]   and motives of third parties and vice versa.
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.520]   What they're saying is that Khan Academy
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:04.160]   would take down the like button just on general principles
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:07.800]   so that they don't get in trouble or Twitter would find them,
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.680]   or I mean, Facebook would find themselves liable
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.600]   for another site's misuse of it.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.640]   Well, why isn't Facebook, instead of doing this, say,
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.920]   we're gonna enforce the rule that says
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.320]   you can't be a Facebook member if you're under 13.
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:21.920]   That eliminates the problem.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.240]   Okay, let's switch to David Boyd's research on this,
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.400]   which found that in people 12 years old, a majority of them.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.200]   I understand. Facebook doesn't enforce it.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.760]   They need to enforce it.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.040]   Oh, wait a second here.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:37.040]   76% of those sites from children at age 12,
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.240]   that is to say, on Facebook,
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.920]   were created with the help of their parents.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.560]   So all Facebook would have to do is say,
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:50.920]   by signing up your child for Facebook, you're agreeing.
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:53.080]   Oh no, no, the parents are helping their children lie.
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:57.120]   That's David's point, because the FTC rules are so owners,
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.840]   if the parent does want you on Facebook for one reason,
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.280]   I had to be able to talk to grandma.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.560]   (indistinct)
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:08.640]   We're losing you again.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:11.040]   You're breaking up.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.840]   I mean, there's always a problem with this kind of thing
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:16.240]   because kids don't vote and their parents do,
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:19.760]   and the parents don't like the sound of certain things.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.880]   Like, for example, that their kids are being,
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.360]   you know, is marginally identifiable,
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.280]   information is being tracked.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:30.400]   There's a larger problem on the wider internet
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.080]   about marketing to children that is borderline predatory
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.720]   because they're using, they're marketing to kids
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.000]   who don't know what marketing is.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]   One example is that there's a McDonald's site
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.600]   that allows kids as young as four years old
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.520]   to register for things.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.520]   And when they register, they voluntarily give
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.400]   certain types of information.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.120]   There are, you know, all the junk food companies,
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.120]   Nesquik and Nestle and McDonald's and all the,
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.200]   and Pepsi, they all have, and most of us are not even aware
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.280]   of this, most of us who don't have kids of that age,
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.240]   that they all have these children sites
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.800]   that are full of games and downloadable stuff.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:09.560]   And they're just being the heck marketed out of them.
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:13.400]   And this is a slightly different idea,
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.120]   but the larger problem that I think Congress and the FTC
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.680]   are having to deal with is the fact that there's a lot
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.240]   of like marketing attention at children.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:25.760]   Part of it is personally identifiable information,
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.080]   but even if they can't personally identify them,
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.800]   they can gather information in an algorithmic way
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:34.000]   and present information in a way that is very compelling
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.280]   to children who just think that they're playing a game
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:39.960]   or something like that when in fact they're being taught
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.680]   to drink Pepsi or something like that.
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:44.320]   - Facebook, so it's really a problem.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.280]   - Facebook's point is that it's really,
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.840]   technologically infeasible.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.680]   It can't be effectively done.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.480]   So what they're saying is they want the commission
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.320]   to not adopt these new standards and consistent
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.480]   with the existing statute, hold general audience plug-in
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:07.280]   providers, i.e. Facebook, liable under COPPA only
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.800]   when they have actual knowledge that they are collecting
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.840]   personal information from a child under 13.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:15.520]   Because they can't otherwise know.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:19.240]   And it would be too onerous to ask them to figure that out.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.040]   I think that's not unfair.
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:22.760]   - Yeah, I think it's more of a technological--
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:23.760]   - It's more of a technological--
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.200]   - Yeah, it's a technological limitation.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.040]   - Right.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.520]   - I think we should make them,
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.160]   I think the government should make them a deal
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:35.240]   and say that okay, we'll say that like is free speech,
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:38.480]   but so is a mother who posts a picture of herself
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.600]   breastfeeding her baby.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.960]   It's also free speech.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.400]   - No, no, I'm sorry.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.560]   - Deal, throughshay.
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:44.760]   - Not allowed.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:45.760]   - Not allowed.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760]   - Gina?
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.760]   - Not allowed.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.760]   - I'm just flashing on these conversations with Gina
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:56.760]   in 13 years with Anna, trying to say, well, dear, no,
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.480]   you really shouldn't do that.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:39:59.480]   Well, did you do that, Mom?
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:00.480]   It's the equivalent of--
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.480]   - Oh yeah.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.480]   - You spoke pot, Dad?
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.480]   - Yeah, how old were you?
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.480]   And you got your Facebook account, Mom.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:08.920]   So let me ask you, Gina, have you thought about this at all?
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.880]   Have you talked with your partner?
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:11.880]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:12.880]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:15.400]   - Have you talked with your partner about this?
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.600]   What age are you gonna let Anna get on Facebook?
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.600]   - Yeah, that's--
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.600]   - 25.
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.440]   - I mean, I'm really hoping to hold out until she's 13, you know, 13 or 14, you know, of
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.440]   age, teenager.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:29.240]   - I let my kids-- there wasn't Facebook, it was my space, but I let my kids have my
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.040]   space pages when they were underage.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:35.960]   - Yeah, me and my brother signed my nephews up for Xbox and lied about their age.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.720]   Like that's, you know, that's basically what everybody does.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:43.320]   I'm, you know, I don't know, I'm gonna try to hold her off as much as possible.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.800]   Right now I'm just trying to get the feeding schedule.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:45.800]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:46.800]   Just get them to sleep and the rest follows.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.840]   - I need a few years to think about it.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.840]   - I was long as you--
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.640]   - We wanna push you to start now, Gina.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:56.640]   Start thinking now.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.640]   - Yeah, when she's 34.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:01.240]   - We're gonna take a break.
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:08.440]   When we come back, tips, tools, and numbers, but first to word from stamps.com, why go to
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:14.240]   the post office when the post office will come to you, I ask you, at stamps.com.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.720]   If you mail a lot of stuff-- this is not-- look, if you mail a letter a month, this isn't
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:24.120]   for you, but if you're an eBay seller, an Amazon seller, an Etsy seller, if you send, you know,
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:30.320]   a business that sends out invoices or, you know, bills, if you do a lot of mailing, you've got
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.600]   to get a stamps.com account.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.480]   It means you can print your own stamps.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:37.480]   It's so much better than a postal meter, for instance.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.320]   I don't know many of you probably have postal meters.
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.320]   No, forget that.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.400]   That's so 19th century.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.480]   With stamps.com you use your computer, your printer.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.560]   You can print right on the envelope, your company logo can be a part of that.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.240]   The address could be a part of that.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:53.040]   So stamps.com, for instance, will pull from your QuickBooks address book and churn out
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.080]   a bunch of envelopes with postage on it and everything is so cool.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.080]   It's so cool.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.000]   For packages too, they'll print out the mailing labels.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000]   If you're doing international mailing, it'll do that.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.840]   The post office loves stamps.com so much they give them discounts you can't get anywhere
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:10.000]   else.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000]   Not at the post office.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000]   21% up to 21% an Express mail, 15% a priority mail.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.440]   It discounts on international mailing.
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:22.040]   You also, you know, the mail carrier will come to you not just on their regular rounds,
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.760]   but you can schedule a free pickup anytime.
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.560]   It's just, it is a great service.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.880]   Let me, let me point you to stamps.com now.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.720]   Right on the front page, you see the $80.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.640]   We're going to do a better job for you.
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.520]   In the 2 billion people who use, that's not right.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:37.520]   What did it say?
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.040]   2 billion people who use stamps.com.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.040]   Click the radio.
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.040]   That can't be right.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:43.040]   There you go.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.040]   Look at that.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.040]   New picture too.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.000]   I aged a little bit.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.360]   Click the radio microphone, enter the offer code Twig and you'll get this $110 bonus offer,
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.920]   including $55 in free postage.
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:56.160]   That great USB scale is so useful.
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:58.440]   You just plop the package or envelope on there.
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:02.600]   It tells you exactly what it costs, always up to date with the stamps.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.000]   $5 supply kit in a four week trial.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000]   No cost to you.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.480]   You just pay the shipping and handling on the scale, which is about $5.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:11.280]   I think stamps.com is fantastic.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.640]   I want you to try it.
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:19.360]   Please take advantage of this very generous, no risk trial offer with $55 free postage from
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.360]   stamps.com.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.920]   You can put up to 25 pounds on that scale cap.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.880]   I don't know what the minimum is.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:28.280]   Announce, I would guess.
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:32.480]   Anything less than an ounce, just go like that and it'll get there.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.240]   That's dot com.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.800]   Click the try it free button, the microphone open the upper right hand corner and use our
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:43.400]   offer code TWIG for that $110 no risk trial.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.400]   We love it.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:45.920]   I got a new pick of that.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:46.920]   Tony Wang took that.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.920]   That's a nice picture.
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:51.080]   That's what I really look like.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.920]   Thank you, Tony, for that taking that picture.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.800]   Gina Trappani, we're going to let you go.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:02.440]   I know you've got something to do breastfeeding, something motherly.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.880]   You've got something to do.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:05.880]   You've got something.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:08.720]   Why don't you give us your tip of the week here?
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.720]   Tip of the week.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.720]   This is kind of exciting.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:16.960]   I just launched today Tapbot, which is the company that makes Tweetbot.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:17.960]   Love, Tweetbot.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:25.960]   They just released a client for app.net, which is an open Twitter alternative.
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:28.560]   Because you're doing a desktop client for Twitter eventually.
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.560]   It's in beta.
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:30.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.560]   It's called Netbot.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:35.800]   So you go to tapbots.com/software/netbot.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:41.200]   This is an app.net client that's got that whole Tweetbot style and feel across posts
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:42.200]   to Twitter.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.200]   Across posts to Twitter.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.200]   That's really cool.
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.200]   You're kidding.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:46.200]   Oh, I'm getting this right now.
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:47.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:48.200]   It's wearing the nine.
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:49.200]   It's for iOS only, unfortunately.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.760]   There are tons of app.net clients and Dalton Caldwell service.
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:54.200]   It's open source.
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.200]   It's got open APIs.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:57.480]   He's lowered the price on that, by the way.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.920]   Oh, and he has lowered the price.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:44:59.920]   It's $36 now.
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:03.280]   A year or you can do $5 a month, something like that.
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:05.440]   I can't remember what it is.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.960]   These folks just make really good iOS apps.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:10.960]   And they've had a lot of experience building a really awesome Twitter client for a long
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:11.960]   time.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:16.240]   So if this app.net client, if app.net, if you want to use app.net more, which I do, and
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:19.800]   I just haven't taken the time to do it, now that you can cross post Twitter, this looks
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:20.800]   pretty good.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:23.440]   So I'm downloading it now from the app store.
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.840]   It's $4.99, interestingly.
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.120]   It's $4.99, whereas Tweetbot is $2.99.
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:31.400]   So app.net in general is a little more expensive.
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:36.600]   But if you're into the open Twitter alternative, this is really good news for app.net, I think.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:40.000]   I am going to now start using this exclusively.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000]   Forget it.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.640]   I'm going to give it a try.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.960]   I'm going to start posting to both and see what's going on at app.net.
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.280]   I think all this really app.net need was a really good client, and this looks like it's
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.280]   it.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.280]   Well, there's dozens.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.440]   That's what's kind of interesting, including one or two iOS and Android clients.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:04.800]   But you get one from a developer like TapBots, which do the best iOS stuff of all.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:05.800]   That's great.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:06.800]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:07.800]   Big news.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:08.800]   Thank you.
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:11.160]   I'm downloading it right now.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.400]   [SINGING]
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:16.560]   Password, and there we go.
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.640]   Do you have a tip or anything you'd like to share with us, Mr. Michael Elgin?
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.960]   Yes.
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:26.160]   I have a general tip for Google+ because there's a whole bunch of people.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:32.000]   There's this kind of growing subculture of people on Google+ who are switching from
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.520]   blogging to blogging on Google+ and banning their blogs.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.520]   Just like you.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.520]   Just like me.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.920]   And Tim O'Reilly is into this as well.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.920]   Really?
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:46.280]   He's a champion of it.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.680]   But there's a whole bunch of people who are on the fence.
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:53.120]   They just can't bring themselves to move to a kind of generic looking site from their
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:55.720]   customized site and all this kind of stuff.
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:58.720]   So I give people the following advice if you want to do this.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:01.120]   First of all, do it as an experiment.
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:04.400]   One month, tell your blog, I'm going to be over blogging on Google+.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.800]   Here's the URL.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.040]   Come check it out for one month.
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.160]   If it doesn't work out, I'll be back on this blog.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:15.640]   And then so that way, you can sort of have an out if you don't like the way it happens.
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:19.480]   But then, when you're on there, don't make the mistake that almost everybody makes,
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.960]   which is that when you post in a link, there's a little box to put in a link and it gives
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.760]   you the little thumbnail and the little blurb.
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.480]   It looks like non-compelling.
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:31.880]   I was going to say it looks like crap, but that's a little too strong.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:32.960]   It doesn't look like crap.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:33.960]   It just doesn't look.
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:36.920]   We live in a visual social web now.
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:37.920]   Everything is visual.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.760]   If you look at the What's Hot list on Google+--
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:41.160]   Oh, is it a Pinterest?
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:43.840]   Look at the rise of Pinterest.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.200]   It's all about pictures.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:50.280]   You have to have compelling visuals with anything you want to be compelling.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.640]   So don't use the little box.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.640]   Don't use the thumbnails.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.840]   Do a full-size picture every single post.
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:58.520]   Even if you're sharing things within reason.
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:01.360]   I mean, some things if you share it, the whole picture will show.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:04.400]   But make sure you have a nice visual.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.960]   Do real blogging on Google+.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:08.840]   Don't blog over there and then just do a link to that blog.
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:11.600]   That's now-- you're never going to get traction that way.
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:17.960]   And almost everybody who does blogging on Google+ sees maybe a tenfold increase in traffic
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:21.720]   and engagement right away within two or three weeks.
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:26.880]   So I just recommend-- I can't say that it's a good idea for everybody.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.680]   A lot of people need better archiving.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.560]   They need curation and stuff like that.
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:37.720]   But if you think you might want to try blogging on Google+, I just recommend people try it
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:39.000]   for a month.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000]   Use big pictures.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000]   Do real blogging.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000]   Be active.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000]   Engage.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.920]   And a lot of people are reporting that it's pretty awesome when they do that.
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:52.600]   And Mike, as I said before we got in the air, when I visited with the Google+ staff, they
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:56.200]   love you and emphasize that they have had no relationship with you.
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.520]   They just-- you're just a super user and amazing user.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:03.080]   I also beat them up every time I have the opportunity to say inline links.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:10.000]   If you look at what Ev Williams did at Medium, it's an extremely simple user interface.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000]   You mark a word, you have five choices.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.720]   Have I just gone down again?
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.720]   Bold, Ital, big, little, or link.
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:23.240]   But just a simple little thing like that in Google+, would make it so much more appropriate
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:25.080]   to the net.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:30.200]   And it's ironic that Google that lives on links and learns from links does not enable
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.720]   links in Google+, and so they've got to just get their act together and do that.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.720]   And I think they know it.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:40.960]   There's a long, long list of things that they really have to do to improve it as a blogging
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:41.960]   platform.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.640]   But Google+ ultimately is supposed to be everything to everyone.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:51.240]   I mean, and so it's a long road to get to that point.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:53.480]   But for now, it has a lot of flaws.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.760]   There are a lot of things missing.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:57.040]   A lot of features we'd like to see.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:02.120]   But there's a hardcore user base of people who are super active, very intelligent, very
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.120]   engaged.
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:08.840]   And so it's really a great place to build a community if you're a writer or if you have
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.320]   any reason to build a community.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.560]   It's a great place to do that.
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.520]   And use the special Mike Elgin formatting technique.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:17.280]   If you really want engagement.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:20.360]   Bold first line headline.
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:21.360]   New paragraph.
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.160]   Picture summary.
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:26.320]   What do you put next?
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.120]   What I typically do is I try to summarize what the information is.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:33.720]   I make the headline actually a sentence with punctuation.
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:34.720]   Not just like a--
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.720]   Okay.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:40.440]   Because I ought to post a Twitter and I wanted to look around Twitter also.
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:45.840]   And just write really clear language.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:55.600]   Use good style for the web, which means a lot of parentheses, very small paragraphs.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:56.760]   Don't be too wordy.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.080]   Have a good picture.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.360]   And then just have a great conversation.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:05.080]   I mean, the post is just the beginning of it.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:08.320]   So you don't want to just have this post that's the final word.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:14.000]   You want to start a conversation, ask questions, crowdsource on every single post or nearly
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.800]   every post.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:18.360]   And it's a great way to learn.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:22.560]   I've always believed that the best thing about blogging isn't what I teach.
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:25.680]   It's what I learn from people who engage in the post.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:27.480]   Amen, brother.
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.480]   Google+ is the best place I've found to do that.
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:36.560]   As Tim O'Reilly said, it's like Tumblr but more social.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:37.560]   Yep.
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:38.560]   Wow.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.960]   I have to think about this.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.920]   Because I don't-- you're like there's only you and a few other people there.
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.480]   Well, you know, I have--
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:49.680]   You've got to admit, it's gotten a little quieter over there.
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:51.800]   Well, it hasn't.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:56.320]   What happened is that you have to keep circling people and you have to keep uncircling people
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:59.320]   because you probably circled like a gazillion people.
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.320]   And they're gone.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:01.320]   And some of those wandered off.
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.320]   Right.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:03.800]   But some new ones wandered in and you haven't circled those yet.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:04.800]   Right.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:05.800]   So I'll send you my Ghostbusters kit.
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:11.240]   I have a Ghostbusters kit on how to keep the engagement going, how to discover all the
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:12.920]   great people.
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:15.320]   You can't be shy about using all the features.
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.320]   You've got to block.
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.320]   You've got to uncircle.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.320]   You've got to circle.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.520]   You've got to plus one.
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:25.880]   And if you really use all the features, I have so many people that I'd like to circle
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:26.880]   that I can't.
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:27.880]   I just-- there's too many people.
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:30.600]   There are too many great photographers.
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:31.600]   Times 100.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:32.600]   Right.
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:37.240]   And people think it's all photographers and tech and stuff like that.
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:43.600]   I dare you to search for any topic, any topic at all, the most obscure topic.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.960]   And you'll find a thriving community around on top.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:49.160]   Home beer brewing, raising rabbits.
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:50.160]   I mean, you name it.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:52.720]   There's lots of people talking about everything there.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:53.920]   You just have to use search.
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:56.040]   You have to keep circling and uncircling.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:57.040]   All right.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:58.840]   Here's the key thing about some of us.
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:02.440]   Google+ real quickly, too, is that supposedly thanks to being on the list.
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:04.760]   I have 1.8 million followers.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:06.400]   But it's obvious.
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:11.840]   And the Google people grin to me when I said this, that everything that I write is not
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:13.200]   presented to all of them.
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:18.120]   They have an algorithm in the middle that chooses to figure out how to give you relevance
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.120]   in your feed.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:20.120]   No doubt.
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.720]   So you are not publishing to everybody you think you're publishing to, which is actually
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:24.720]   OK.
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:28.560]   So those who might be interested in me, Google has a good job with that algorithm, because
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:33.600]   after all, life is an algorithm, then they're delivering relevance to those people.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:36.000]   And that's why they come back in the conversation with me.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000]   And same for me.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.200]   I get relevant stuff and not irrelevant crap.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:43.640]   And so that's how Google is very, very, very quietly.
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:45.040]   They won't acknowledge it so much.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:50.720]   But they are stage managing the conversation through a gigantic conversational algorithm,
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:54.120]   which is the untold story, I think, of Google+.
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:55.120]   And you notice it?
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.880]   Can you tell?
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:02.120]   I can tell that I'm not getting junk replies from the people with strange names from other
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:04.360]   lands or made up names.
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.360]   Gina?
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:10.400]   Yeah, I've been tracking plus ones or reply rates over my Google+ post through ThinkUp
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.400]   for a while now.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:15.480]   And every once in a while, I get a post that just goes crazy nuts off the map.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:16.960]   And they must be promoting it.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.200]   It must make it into a higher feed.
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:23.360]   But yeah, there's definitely an algorithm there where they're promoting stuff, showing
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.360]   more stuff.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:28.760]   I don't know if it's content based, I don't know if it's uptake right away.
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:30.120]   But yeah, I think Jeff is absolutely right.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:32.640]   And I'd actually love to know more about it.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:33.880]   They won't say a word.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.440]   Yeah, good luck.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.840]   Well, Facebook does that too, right?
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:44.200]   I mean, in fact, Facebook just announced for seven bucks you can buy a desire position
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.520]   in the news feed.
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:46.520]   Oh, God.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.880]   I don't know if that's a good idea.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.800]   That's kind of a sign of desperation.
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:52.800]   Seven dollars.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:55.840]   You're so lonely.
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.520]   Every time you're on Mike, you convince me to try it again.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:54:59.520]   So I go back.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.960]   Although now I'm using AppNet on my tap bots on my iPhone.
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:03.920]   And I love it.
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:06.640]   I have a strong case against AppNet as well.
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:11.200]   So I'm sure you do.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:16.840]   The beauty of advertisers supported social networking like Facebook and Google+ and
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:23.960]   Twitter is that it's egalitarian and international.
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:29.560]   So there are people for whom the now the $5 a month thing or whatever AppNet is charging
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.480]   is a huge amount of money.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.440]   And so you end up with a very elite group of people.
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:36.440]   And maybe that's a desirable thing.
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:41.680]   But there's something thrilling to me about being able to talk to the entire world and
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:43.440]   the advertising and subsidizing it.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:46.440]   Yeah, Google+ doesn't have advertising in Google+, but it is.
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:52.120]   And advertising supported social networks, just the ads are somewhere else.
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:59.200]   But I really hope that they open up App.Net and make it free eventually.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:01.680]   And I would really get behind it if that was the case.
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:03.320]   Yeah, I mean, that's a really fair point, Mike.
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:05.400]   And earlier I called App.Net open.
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:06.400]   It's obviously not open source.
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.000]   When I said open, it just means I meant that it provides an open API without restriction.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.920]   And there are definitely problems with App.Net.
[01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:15.320]   The cost being one of them.
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:19.360]   It's interesting to see alternatives and see what kind of takes out.
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:23.840]   Do your number, Mr. Jarvis?
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:24.840]   All right.
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:27.360]   I'm going to have a fun one, not the stuff I had to run down.
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:32.440]   So Mike Errington blog this week, I love it so much, that a Kickstarter project for
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:38.160]   a book on how to fund Kickstarter projects, of course, failed and didn't get its $35,000
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:39.160]   to be done.
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:42.200]   So I just enjoyed the irony and that's my number.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.760]   How do you use Kickstarter?
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:48.960]   Not how we did it, apparently.
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:53.920]   We don't know anything about using Kickstarter.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:58.080]   We didn't mention it and I wish I didn't bring my phone in, but I see somebody mentioned
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:07.560]   it in the run down, this new Google app, which I find very interesting, called, what's
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.560]   it called?
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:09.560]   Field trip.
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.560]   Field trip.
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.560]   Field trip.
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:12.560]   I like it.
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:13.560]   But now who wrote that they took it out?
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:14.560]   I did.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:15.560]   I did.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:19.280]   The problem was it wasn't giving me any specific was just saying, hey, we have less.
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:21.520]   Oh, no, no, you got to come to Petaluma.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:23.640]   Oh, it depends where you are.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:24.640]   I live in New York.
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:25.840]   You think I have myself?
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:26.840]   You would think.
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:30.800]   I can't go the block with that and I turned on it telling me because you can say, hey,
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.480]   if I see something, if I walk by something interesting, tell me I can't go block with
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:39.320]   that saying over there is where they filmed American graffiti.
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:42.840]   There's the house in Peggy Sue got married across the street.
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:45.040]   The last performance of sublime.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.040]   It's constant.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:49.040]   Petaluma, they must have somebody in Petaluma.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.040]   I like it.
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.040]   It's beautifully done.
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.040]   Great idea.
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:53.040]   It's free.
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.720]   There's a story behind it, which I've forgotten about.
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:58.760]   It's about it's Genesis.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:57:59.960]   It's from a Googler.
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:00.960]   Yes.
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:04.360]   It's called Field trip free for Android.
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:11.600]   The idea is it has a number of sources to tell you about points of interest as you wander
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:14.280]   your world.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:18.400]   One of the sources is a movie location book.
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:21.080]   Apparently a lot of movies were filmed in Petaluma.
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:22.680]   That's fun.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:26.400]   It's got architecture, historic places, offers and deals.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:28.320]   You can see why they did this.
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:33.240]   Food, drinks and fun, movie locations, outdoor art and obscure places of interest.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:34.760]   It has a setting.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:39.520]   It says, you can say, have it announced it out loud as I walk by, which is quite.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:42.560]   I've had a number of conversations as I'm walking down the street with people and my
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:45.280]   phone starts talking and I say, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:48.600]   It tells me something and say, look, we move on.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:49.920]   I should get it anyway.
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:50.920]   It's free.
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.920]   It's interesting.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:52.920]   It's different.
[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:53.920]   Field trip.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:55.360]   It's the future of all search.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:59.560]   I think that what's going to happen in the future is that there will be constant harvesting
[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:02.560]   of contextual information.
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:06.640]   There'll just be a screaming feed on the nearest computer of search results going by, even
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:08.200]   though you never asked a question.
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.200]   Amen.
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:10.200]   There's a company.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:15.240]   There's something that was launched at TechCrunch Disrupt called Mind meld.
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:16.880]   It's an iPad app.
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:22.400]   Basically what this does is you do a video conference and the app listens to what everybody
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:25.960]   is talking about and provides results as you're going by.
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:28.560]   You know, you have a conversation, what was the name of that actor?
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:30.520]   It just pops it up for you.
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:34.400]   It'll just put that actress there even if you never even look at the screen.
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:36.120]   It just does it with constant and real time.
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:40.480]   I think that's the future of, I think that we're getting to the point where we're going
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:45.600]   to have search results always at our fingertips, whether we search or not.
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:46.680]   That's going to be a good thing.
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:50.480]   It's going to be a terrible thing also because children will grow up not knowing how to ask
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:53.080]   questions because they'll always have answers.
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:55.080]   Somebody will be talking to them.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:57.080]   No, I don't know.
[01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:58.880]   I kind of think it's interesting.
[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:04.080]   Eric Schmidt's pants example, basically.
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.880]   I don't know why it doesn't have New York.
[02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:07.640]   It goes off all the time for me.
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.800]   I'll get it to work, but it goes off with just narrow stuff.
[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:13.840]   So my wife said it'd kill me if I don't hate dinner soon, but I just want one little
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:18.920]   trivia, eight thirty one and Twitter just sent me a link from the Verge saying that YouTube
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:23.680]   is today announcing changes to the policies surrounding its copy ID, copyright management
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:24.680]   protection system.
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:27.800]   Well, we'll see what they are and then I will cheer.
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:31.560]   Maybe we did it all by ourselves.
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:34.360]   Human beings will have final say says the pull quote.
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:36.200]   Oh, well, I hope that's right.
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:38.640]   Well, that could really change our lives.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:39.920]   Thank you so much, Jeff, for being here.
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:40.920]   Go have dinner.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:46.120]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com, also the author of public parts available now at finer
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:50.360]   bookstores all about life in the public sheet of Japan.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.160]   Is that smarter where that org?
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:53.160]   That's her blog.
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:57.800]   You can also download her work from think up.com.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:59.240]   It's great to have you back.
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:00.240]   We miss you.
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:01.640]   It's wonderful to have you back, mom.
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:02.640]   Great to be back.
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:03.640]   Great to be back.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:04.640]   Congratulations.
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:05.640]   Thank you.
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:08.520]   Thank you to Mike Elgin for joining us all the way from Greece where it's now like three

[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:10.520]   I don't know.
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:11.520]   It's late.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:12.360]   Well, let you get a bed.
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:14.120]   It's never too late in Greece.
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:15.360]   It's time for dinner.
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:18.880]   Yeah, absolutely.

[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:53.040]   Hodge.
